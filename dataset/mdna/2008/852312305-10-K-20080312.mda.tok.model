the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy staar is currently focusing on the following four strategic goals improving cash flow  increasing us sales by reversing the decline in cataract sales and improving the growth of refractive sales  successfully integrating staar japan  and maintaining and expanding international growth rates 
improve cash flow 
in fiscal year  staar used million of cash in operations 
staar s use of cash principally results from net losses in us operations 
staar s international operations have generally generated cash or been cash flow neutral in recent periods 
staar implemented cost cutting measures in the third fiscal quarter of and the first fiscal quarter of  including targeted reductions in the us workforce 
the effects of these efforts is expected to be a reduction of approximately million from the spending levels in the us beginning in december  staar began a process to closely rationalize and evaluate its spending levels 
this evaluation has identified opportunities that staar expects to yield approximately million in annualized cost savings 
these initiatives include streamlining staar s us organization by reducing spending levels in all areas of the business  renegotiating or eliminating certain obligations  and eliminating all executive bonus opportunities until staar shows positive trends toward achieving profitability 
staar has organized a task force comprised of senior management to identify and implement during an additional million to million in global cost reduction initiatives 
because of the higher margins resulting from visian icl sales  staar had previously expected that following the visian icl introduction increased us refractive sales would relatively quickly lead to positive aggregate cash flow 
however  slower than expected growth in visian icl sales  along with continued erosion in us cataract sales  have prolonged negative cash flow in the us staar now believes that reducing its use of cash in the us depends on further reductions in its cost structure as well as the reversal of recent sales trends 
staar believes that cataract product introductions made and anticipated in and will provide an opportunity for staar to rationalize its cataract product offering by focusing on higher value products and reducing or eliminating costs associated with lesser value products 

table of contents while significant reductions in costs are possible  achieving positive cash flow while investing in the cataract business will also require increased revenue through us sales performance of cataract products 
if new cataract product introductions by staar do not generate significant additional revenues  staar may be required to more significantly scale down its us operations 
increase us sales by reversing the decline in cataract sales and improving the growth of refractive sales 
in fiscal year staar experienced a flat rate of growth in us refractive sales and a decrease of in us cataract sales over fiscal year staar has significantly modified its us selling strategy to reverse these trends 
refractive sales 
because the icl s design has advantages over other refractive procedures for many patients and its proprietary nature permits staar to maintain its profit margin  staar s management believes that increased sales of the visian icl are the key to the company s return to profitability 
notwithstanding strong and sustained growth internationally  us market growth is considered essential because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
the visian icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december  the us rollout of the product began in the first quarter of staar recognized million of us sales revenue from icls during the fiscal year ended december  icl sales in the us  while profitable  did not grow in beyond the level reached in the first year of introduction 
staar s management believes that the following factors were the most important causes of lower than expected us refractive growth in disruption resulting from staar s reorganization of its us sales force and its decision not to renew its two remaining contracts with regional manufacturer s representatives affected refractive as well as cataract sales 
in the refractive area  staar believes that this disruption resulted in fewer calls on newly certified visian icl surgeons to encourage further icl purchases and to assist them in integrating the visian icl procedure in their practices 
other newly introduced surgical products competed with the visian icl for the attention of surgeons seeking to add new  high value surgical products  in particular multifocal and accommodating iols 
sales of instruments used for the visian icl procedure  which staar reports as refractive sales  declined as the rate at which new surgeons were certified leveled off 
staar makes the icl available to selected surgeons only after completion of a training program that includes proctoring of selected supervised surgeries 
staar believes that this carefully guided method of product release is essential to help ensure the consistent quality of patient outcomes and the high levels of patient satisfaction needed to establish wide acceptance of the icl as a primary choice for refractive surgery 
as staar enters its third year of icl marketing in the us  it is placing less emphasis on increasing its overall customer base and devoting more attention to identifying and supporting those practices that show potential for significant repeat business through a professional commitment to the icl technology 
staar will continue to provide training and proctoring to all qualified surgeons seeking certification in the icl 
because the refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  staar faces special challenges in introducing an intraocular refractive implant 
staar has developed a number of marketing tools and practice support programs to increase the use of the icl and awareness of its advantages in refractive surgery centers throughout the us and around the world 
in the us  staar previously depended on a primarily independent sales force to promote both cataract and refractive product sales 
in regions where regional manufacturer s representatives rmrs had contracts giving them exclusive rights to represent the icl  staar had to rely on the independent representatives to implement the marketing of the icl 
to support the promotion of icl 
table of contents sales in these regions  staar developed marketing plans under which it assumed the responsibility of training surgeons through a staff of highly trained applications specialists who are direct employees of staar 
despite staar s taking on the cost and administrative burden of this activity  staar was still obligated to pay commissions to the independent representatives on all sales generated in their regions 
beginning in staar also provided at its expense the services of refractive specialists who would assist interested surgeons in evaluating their practices and fully incorporating icl into the spectrum of refractive treatments offered 
when staar restructured its us sales force in the third quarter of it separated the primary cataract and refractive selling efforts 
the refractive sales team was built around staar s existing refractive sales employees and newly recruited employees  including some former independent sales representatives who had excelled at introducing and promoting our refractive products 
when it has been newly introduced in international markets  icl sales have generally grown slowly but steadily 
while the absence of growth in refractive sales in the us in was not expected  staar believes that steady refractive sales growth will resume in the changes to the refractive selling model implemented during the fourth quarter  appear to have contributed to growth in us refractive sales experienced by staar during the first two months of continuing this trend for the remainder of is a key goal of staar s management team 
staar s ticl corrects both myopia and astigmatism  and has been shown to be highly effective in treating individuals severely affected by these conditions 
when staar has introduced the ticl in international markets it has generally experienced rapid growth  and the ticl may also lead to increased icl sales by introducing more patients and physicians to the icl technology 
staar has applied for approval of the ticl in the us  but the fda has suspended review of the application pending resolution of concerns regarding staar s oversight of the ticl clinical study 
this agency action is discussed above under the caption business recent correspondence with fda regarding clinical oversight and ticl approval 
based on experience in international markets  staar believes that us sales of the icl will increase even if ticl approval continues to be delayed 
nevertheless  staar believes that approval and introduction of the ticl would significantly enhance refractive sales in the us obtaining approval remains a part of staar s long term strategy 
cataract sales 
for several years staar has experienced a decline in us market share of iols  and those sales declined in factors contributing to long term decline in us cataract sales include the slow pace of cataract product improvement and enhancement during a period when we devoted most of our research and development resources to introducing the icl and to resolving the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the fda 
staar believes that during the historical trends leading to staar s long term decline in cataract sales were exacerbated by the following factors disruption resulting from staar s election not to renew its last two contracts with regional manufacturer s representative  which expired on july   and the resulting uncertainty affecting our independent sales force  staar s lag behind its competitors in the introduction of iols with advanced aspheric optics and the entry of alcon into the market for toric iols 
staar elected not to renew the last two rmr contracts between staar and the rmrs  which covered the southwestern and southeastern us and expired on july   and has undertaken a comprehensive restructuring of its sales organization  which includes a number of the independent territorial representatives who have long serviced staar customers  but could not begin this effort until the contracts had expired 
staar believes that the uncertainty surrounding expiration of the contracts and the time needed to complete the restructuring of its sales force resulted in less effective selling efforts during 
table of contents staar s management believes that the disruption caused by the changes in management of its us sales force has largely been resolved 
while customers lost to competitors in may be difficult to recover  staar believes that the enhancements to its cataract product offering made in and planned for  as discussed below  will provide its reorganized sales force an opportunity to build new sales and resume staar s growth in the sector 
aspheric iols use advanced optical designs intended to provide a clearer image than traditional spherical lenses  especially in low light  which has led to significant market share gains for aspheric designs 
while staar introduced collamer and silicone aspheric lenses in  and expects to introduce an additional collamer aspheric model in  most of our competitors introduced their designs months or years before staar 
staar believes that its introduction of iols with advanced aspheric optics have already enhanced the market appeal of its cataract product line  and will continue to do so in however  customers who may have switched to other manufacturer s aspheric lenses may be difficult to recapture 
staar has applied to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for new technology iol ntiol status for its three piece collamer aspheric iol  and intends to apply also for its one piece collamer iol now in development and its silicone iol 
ntiol status allows higher reimbursement rates when an aspheric iol can demonstrate specifically improved visual performance over conventional iols  and if granted is expected to add an average margin on each eligible iol 
because the overwhelming majority of iol purchases in the us are reimbursed through medicare  ntiol status would significantly increase staar s margin on these lenses 
toric iols  which treat pre existing astigmatism in addition to cataracts  were previously sold only by staar in the us because cms allow cataract patients receiving reimbursement to pay a premium for the correction of pre existing astigmatism  while medicare provides the customary reimbursement for cataract surgery  toric iols can be sold at a higher price and higher profit margin than standard iols 
cms also permits the patient to separately remunerate the surgeon for the significant additional services needed to prescribe and implant a lens with toric correction for astigmatism 
the increased revenues and profit margin originally expected by staar as a result of the cms ruling have  to date  not been realized because of competition with the alcon product offering 
in particular  staar believes that in a number of customers who previously had purchased staar s toric iol but had otherwise been customers of alcon s ophthalmic products  converted to use of the alcon toric iol 
despite this reduction in toric iol sales volume  staar s management believes that the significant lower selling price of its toric iol presents opportunities to rebuild market share 
staar is currently developing a collamer toric iol  which staar believes will be more competitive with alcon s acrylic toric iol 
during  research and development at staar resulted in the introduction of the aspheric and square edged models of both staar s three piece collamer iol and its three piece silicone iol 
during  staar also completed joint development of the nanopoint tm injector with the swiss company medicel ag 
the nanopoint injector delivers staar s collamer plate iol through an incision as small as mm and is planned to be launched early in the second quarter of staar intends to continue to focus on the following projects designed to make our cataract product offering more competitive obtaining ntiol status for staar s aspheric lenses  resulting in higher reimbursement rates from cms  developing a collamer toric iol to complement our pioneering silicone toric iol and better compete with the alcon acrylic toric iol  enhancing the injector system for our three piece collamer iol to improve delivery  and developing an all new injector system for the three piece collamer iol  and developing a preloaded injector system for our new silicone aspheric iols 
staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays 

table of contents while the silicone lens market segment is slowly declining overall  staar believes its collamer lenses have outstanding optical qualities and superior biocompatibility  and should be capable of competing with any our competitor s acrylic lens products in the advanced material sector 
increasing sales of the icl  which also relies on the outstanding optical properties of collamer  have been introducing the advantages of the collamer material to a growing number of surgeons 
however  growth of the collamer iol market has been limited by the difficulty of perfecting delivery systems for the soft collamer material 
although acrylic lenses do not have the same level of optical performance in the eye as collamer and often introduce glare or glistenings into the visual field  the stiffness and toughness of the acrylic material makes design of delivery systems simpler 
staar believes that the introduction of the nanopoint microincision injector for the one piece collamer iol in the early second quarter of  and enhanced delivery system for the three piece collamer iol later in the year  will broaden the appeal of collamer iols 
as discussed under the caption business regulatory requirements  between december  and july   staar received warning letters  form inspectional observations and other correspondence from the fda indicating that the fda deemed staar s monrovia  california facility to be violating the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations  warning of possible enforcement action and suspending approval of class iii medical devices to which the violations related 
staar believes that it has resolved the issues giving rise to those agency actions to the satisfaction of the fda staff 
nevertheless  staar believes that it has not yet fully overcome the reputational harm caused by the fda s past findings of compliance deficiencies  which may continue to present a challenge in increasing us product sales 
in the opinion of staar s management  the recent warning letter from bimo and the integrity hold placed on staar s clinical activities by the office of device evaluation  which concern staar s oversight of clinical activities rather than it quality systems  have perpetuated the reputational harm resulting from the earlier fda actions  and made sales of staar s products more challenging 
reversing the decline in us iol sales will require staar to overcome several short and long term challenges  including successfully meeting its objectives to develop new and enhanced products  organizing  training and managing a specialized cataract sales force  competing with much larger companies and overcoming reputational harm from the fda s findings of compliance deficiencies 
we cannot assure that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
successfully integrate staar japan 
early in fiscal year staar completed the acquisition of the remaining interests in its japan based joint venture  canon staar co  inc canon staar 
this transaction is discussed under item 
business acquisition of remaining interests in japanese joint venture 
canon  inc and its affiliated marketing company  canon marketing japan inc cmj collectively owned of canon staar prior to the closing of the acquisition on december   and staar owned the other 
following the closing of the acquisition on december   canon staar became a wholly owned subsidiary of staar operating under the name staar japan  inc canon staar was created in pursuant to a joint venture agreement between staar and the canon companies for the principal purpose of designing  manufacturing  and selling in japan intraocular lenses and other ophthalmic products 
its current business consists of manufacturing and selling the preloaded injector 
it has also been working to secure approval from japanese regulatory authorities to sell the icl  collamer iols and aquaflow device in japan 
canon staar recorded worldwide sales of million in fiscal year although staar participated as shareholder and director in the oversight of canon staar over its twenty year history  staar and its officers were not involved in day to day management of the joint venture 
in completing the acquisition staar relied on the completeness and accuracy of the information provided during pre closing due diligence 
as a result  integrating staar japan with staar faces some of the same challenges typically faced by the acquirer of an unrelated company 

table of contents through the acquisition staar sought to achieve the following goals to better exploit the japanese market for staar s technology and the worldwide market for the preloaded injector technology through greater control of distribution  to re acquire control of world wide exclusive rights to staar s technology  especially the icl and collamer iol  previously licensed to the joint venture  to eliminate the risk that canon staar could become a competitor of staar  especially after a change in control of staar  to increase access to the preloaded injector technology  and to develop a more effective global r d strategy by leveraging the combined technical resources in japan and the us and taking advantage of staar japan s proven expertise in injector design 
control of distribution 
cmj has been the exclusive distributor of canon staar products in japan throughout the joint venture s history 
while the canon companies are a global leader in optics  canon staar s iol s have been the only surgical product of the canon companies and represented an insignificant portion of their total business 
as a smaller company exclusively focused on ophthalmic implants  staar believes that it will be better positioned to exploit the value of the products developed and manufactured for the japanese market by staar japan 
in addition  staar s swiss subsidiary has already served as canon staar s distributor for preloaded injectors in europe and australia and on a non exclusive basis in china 
staar believes distribution of preloaded injectors outside japan can yield greater sales in the future  in particular following the introduction of an acrylic preloaded injector 
the cataract market in japan is one of the world s largest  and enjoys high average selling prices 
mean myopia rates in japan also makes it an attractive market for refractive surgery 
while canon staar experienced losses in  it has historically earned modest profits and higher gross margins than staar s world average 
in addition  by absorbing the distribution business previously operated by canon marketing japan  staar expects to add the distributor s historical margins to staar japan s gross margin 
accordingly  staar believes that the acquisition of the canon companies interests in canon staar will likely improve its financial results in the short term and could lead to long term improvements if control of distribution leads to better marketing and increased sales 
re acquisition of world wide exclusive rights to staar technology 
in  pursuant to the canon staar joint venture agreement and a technical assistance and license agreement tala  staar granted to canon staar an irrevocable  exclusive right to make  have made and sell products using its technology in japan  and an irrevocable  non exclusive license to sell products using our technology in the rest of the world 
under a settlement agreement staar also granted to canon staar an irrevocable  exclusive license to make and have made products using our technology in china and to sell such products made in china in china and japan 
as a result of these licenses  canon staar had the ability to become a worldwide competitor of staar using staar s own technology 
in addition  the worldwide non exclusive rights held by canon staar limited staar s ability to exploit the value of its own intellectual property through license agreements  because they prevented staar from granting any another company exclusive rights in any territory or assigning all rights under any of its patents 
the tala covered not only the license and transfer to canon staar of staar s intellectual property in existence at the time the joint venture was formed  but all intellectual property staar might develop in the future 
accordingly  staar believes the reacquisition of the rights granted under the tala and the settlement agreement are of significant value to staar and its shareholders 
eliminating the risk that canon staar could become a competitor of staar  especially after a change in control of staar 
prior to the acquisition  if staar had entered into a merger or other reorganization  had been acquired or was subject of a take over attempt or experienced other events of default under the joint venture agreement  the canon companies would have had the right to acquire staar s interest in canon staar at book value 
book value of staar s interest in canon staar was approximately million as of december  staar believes that book value would not have represented the fair value of its interest in the joint venture  especially because following the purchase of its interests the canon companies 
table of contents staar would lose its rights under the joint venture agreement to control the worldwide exploitation of staar s technology in competition with staar 
staar also believes that elimination of this risk has greatly enhanced its opportunity to enter into strategic transactions that may benefit its stockholders 
increase access to the preloaded injector technology 
canon staar introduced the world s first preloaded injector in  and staar believes that canon staar remains a leader in this technology 
foldable iols are typically stored and shipped in an unfolded state  and then folded just before surgery to ensure that they quickly resume their proper shape on implantation 
as a result  designing an effective preloaded injector involves many challenges 
among other things  it requires the engineering of an injector that is mechanically sound but also safe as a long term container for the iol  that can reliably fold the lens for delivery  smoothly compress and deliver the lens through a small incision  typically less than mm in width  then release the lens in a safe and predictable manner 
in the course of developing the first practical preloaded injector canon staar filed patents on various innovations in japan  the us and elsewhere in the world 
these are among the patents of canon staar acquired in the acquisition 
all rights under these patents were held exclusively by canon staar  with no express license for use by staar or any other company except a limited license to nidek in connection with distributing the acrylic preloaded injector 
while staar has many injector patents of its own  as a result of past transactions or disputes  it entered into cross licenses or covenants not to sue covering existing injector technology with the other major us ophthalmic companies  alcon  amo and bausch lomb 
staar believes the existing patents acquired in the acquisition of canon staar will not be subject to those agreements 
staar is still evaluating the newly acquired patents  but believes that in addition to securing its own access to preloaded injector technology these patents enhance staar s proprietary position in the technology vis vis its competitors 
develop a more effective global r d strategy by combining staar japan s proven expertise in injector design with staar s expertise in ophthalmic lenses and materials 
both staar and canon staar have devoted substantial resources to r d 
through working with the joint venture staar believes that the japanese and us r d teams have complementary skills 
for example  although staar first developed and patented the concept of a preloaded injector and experimented with its design  it was canon staar s r d staff that developed the first practical working model 
staar believes that the complementary talents of the us and japan teams will provide opportunities for greater synergies and efficiencies and the development of new products that could continue staar s tradition of innovation 
as in any acquisition  the integration of canon staar will present staar with a number of challenges  including  but not limited to  the following  the risk that staar may not successfully integrate the former canon staar business or its employees into its overall business  the risk that key employees of staar japan may leave  the risk that removal of the canon name from staar japan and its products may reduce its goodwill or the acceptance of its products  the risk that staar japan may not sustain current or prior sales levels or achieve projected levels  the risk that staar s limited access to information has limited its ability to accurately assess the projections of management of staar japan  the risk that japanese regulators may not approve the sale of the icl or collamer iols  the risk of operating a foreign subsidiary with limited direct oversight  the risk that applying us accounting standards and controls and procedures over financial reporting may be more difficult  more expensive or more time consuming than anticipated  staar s reliance on the completeness and accuracy of information provided during its investigation of the staar japan business  and the risk that staar japan may find financing for its operations or for additional working capital purposes difficult to obtain on reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents in the period immediately following the closing of the acquisition  staar has seen no negative impact on sales from ceasing use of the canon name or operating as a company independent of canon 
however  staar cautions that it is too early to definitively determine that no negative effects of this change will emerge in the future 
because of the strategic importance of the staar japan business to staar  and the risks to realizing the full value of the transaction listed above  staar intends to devote significant resources to completing the integration of staar japan in failure to successfully integrate staar japan could significantly harm staar and its business 
maintain and expand international growth rates 
staar s revenue from international markets has grown steadily in recent periods 
during  this growth primarily resulted from increased sales of icl and ticl and the growth of staar s german distribution business conducted through domilens 
the icl and ticl are sold in more than countries 
international refractive sales have continued at a steady rate of growth  increasing approximately in staar believes that the international market for its refractive products has the potential for further growth  both through the introduction of the icl and ticl in new territories and expanded market share in existing territories 
staar received approval for the icl in china on july  and received approval of the ticl and hyperopic icl in china in march we also continue to seek new approvals for the icl and ticl in other countries  but the timing of such approvals are at the discretion of the local authorities 
domilens vertrieb fuer medizinische produkte gmbh is a leading distributor of ophthalmic products in germany 
products sold by domilens include implantable lenses  related surgical equipment  consumables and other supplies 
domilens sells custom surgical kits that incorporate a surgeon s preferred supplies and consumables in a single ready to use package  and services phacoemulsification and other surgical equipment made by third parties 
in addition to distributing and servicing products of third party manufacturers  domilens distributes staar s refractive products and preloaded injectors 
domilens sales in were million  a increase over sales in of this growth  approximately million is the result of favorable changes in currency 
in  staar s efforts to further integrate domilens resulted in a significant increase in icl and ticl sales in germany  where staar believes its market potential remains significantly unrealized 
staar intends to foster continued growth at domilens by encouraging the continuation of its historically successful customer focused business model as a distributor  and by working to further develop domilens as platform for selling staar s own higher value proprietary products 
staar japan s silicone preloaded injectors are sold in japan  china  europe and australia  among other countries 
staar believes the convenience and reliability of the preloaded injector can yield further growth in international markets 
in particular  staar believes that the acrylic preloaded injector jointly developed by staar japan and nidek  inc will provide opportunities to expand staar s presence in international cataract surgery 
other highlights medical device regulatory compliance  clinical oversight and ticl approval 
as discussed above under the caption business regulatory matters  staar s ability to develop  manufacture and distribute its products depends heavily on maintaining good standing with the fda and other regulatory agencies 
staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
staar has invested significant resources in maintaining regulatory compliance and expects to continue to do so in the future 
staar s business activities as a sponsor of biomedical research are subject to review by the fda s bimo branch 
following staar s submission of a pre market approval application pma supplement for the ticl to the fda on april   bimo conducted an inspection of staar s clinical study procedures  practices  and documentation related to the ticl between february and march  at the close of the inspection  staar received eight inspectional observations on form  to which it responded on april  notwithstanding the response  on june  the fda s bimo branch issued a warning letter to staar noting four areas of noncompliance observed during the bimo inspection 
staar provided its written response to the warning letter to the fda on july  
table of contents on august  staar received a letter from the fda office of device evaluation ode notifying staar that the ticl application would be placed on integrity hold until staar completed specified actions to the satisfaction of the fda 
noting the same deficiencies cited in the june  warning letter from the bimo branch  and other deficiencies noted in an audit of a clinical study site  ode requested that staar engage a third party auditor to conduct an audit of patient records along with a clinical systems audit to ensure accuracy and completeness of data before resubmitting the application 
the third party auditor completed the second phase of the work required by ode  which involved a data inspection at the seven clinical sites  during february the third party auditor will begin the third phase of its inspection  specifically an inspection of staar s clinical systems and data on march  following that  the third party auditor will undertake any necessary amendments to clinical data  assess staar s clinical quality systems and perform any necessary follow up actions necessary to confirm the scientific validity of the ticl clinical data through the process outlined by the fda 
the third party auditor will conduct the audit under the oversight of the fda and staar s communications with the auditors will be limited until the project is complete 
while staar believes these actions  if successful  should resolve the issues raised in the recent warning letter and enable staar to resubmit the ticl application in an approvable form  staar cannot assure investors that the results of the independent audit or staar s corrective actions will be satisfactory  that ode will grant approval to the ticl  or that the scope of requested ticl approval  if granted  would not be limited by the fda 
financing strategy while staar s international business generates positive cash flow and of staar s revenue  staar has reported losses on a consolidated basis over the last several years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
in may staar raised net proceeds of million from the public offering and sale of equity securities  the proceeds of which were used to pay off the march million broadwood note and for general working capital purposes 
on december   staar also borrowed million from broadwood partners  lp  primarily to fund the acquisition of staar s remaining interest in the canon staar joint venture  at an interest rate of per annum 
staar s management believes that its best prospect for achieving profitability in its us and consolidated operations is to significantly increase us sales of the icl and to reduce operating expenses 
in the longer term staar seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  staar is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis in fiscal staar plans to avoid  if possible  additional rounds of equity financing and potential dilution to the interests of existing stockholders  and instead to finance its operations through funds from operations and existing cash resources  and to take further efforts to reduce its cash burn in the us investigation of fraud at domilens gmbh during the first quarter of staar learned that the then president of domilens  guenther roepstorff  had misappropriated significant corporate assets 
mr 
roepstorff resigned shortly after the disclosure and staar conducted an extensive internal inquiry under the direction of the audit committee of staar s board of directors 
the results of this investigation are described in detail in staar s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the investigation determined that fraudulent activities by mr 
roepstorff between through diverted assets having a book value of approximately  based on the investigation  staar concluded that the events at domilens revealed a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting  and that increased oversight was necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence 
staar s corrective measures to address the material weakness in its internal controls are discussed under item a controls and procedures 

table of contents other recent highlights growth in international sales of visian icls 
the decline in the us cataract business during was offset by a increase in international sales of the icl and ticl 
competition with multifocal iols 
the us iol market continues to be affected by sales of multifocal and accommodating lenses resulting from a ruling of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the ruling permits medicare covered cataract patients to receive more highly priced multifocal or accommodating iols sometimes referred to as presbyopic lenses by paying only the additional cost of the lens and surgical procedure while still receiving reimbursement for the basic cost of cataract surgery and a monofocal iol 
this has increased the number of patients to whom surgeons offer the alternative of the higher priced lenses 
in january  the cms made a similar ruling  which allows a medicare patient to pay a premium for a lens that also corrects astigmatism 
staar expects this ruling will enhance the market for a collamer toric iol currently in development 
nevertheless  with the help of the cms ruling  presbyopic lenses are expected to claim a share of the cataract market in the future  and staar does not offer a lens of this type 
seasonality 
we generally experience lower sales during the third quarter due to the effect of summer vacations on elective procedures 
in particular  because sales activity in europe drops dramatically in the summer months  and european sales have recently accounted for a greater proportion of our total sales  this seasonal variation in our results has become even more pronounced 
foreign currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in approximately countries 
during fiscal year  sales from international operations represented of total sales 
the results of operations and the financial position of certain of our foreign operations are reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements  exposing us to currency translation risk 
for fiscal year  changes in currency exchange rates had a million favorable impact on net sales 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin increased to for fiscal year  compared with in the increase was primarily due to the reduction in inventory reserves  higher average selling prices of certain iols and ticls  increased volume of icls and ticls and improved overall iol costs  partially offset by higher manufacturing engineering costs 
research and development 
we spent approximately of our sales on research and development which includes regulatory and quality assurance expenses during fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was due to decreased legal fees and costs associated with new product development

cash flow 
we exited the year with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted short term investments compared with million at december  we used approximately million for operating activities during fiscal  which is above the million used during fiscal cash used in investing activities was approximately million and resulted primarily from the million advance deposit for the acquisition of the remaining interest in canon staar and approximately  in purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million primarily resulting from the receipt of million in net proceeds from the public offering of  shares of common stock  million in proceeds from broadwood notes see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation credit facilities contractual obligations and commitments and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repayment of the million principal under the first broadwood note  a repayment of a million line of credit  the  repayment of a note payable related to the acquisition of the minority interest of our australian subsidiary and  in payments under capital lease lines of credit 
the company believes it can reduce and ultimately reverse its operating losses and negative cash flows in the future as icl sales reach targeted levels and the ticl is approved in the us in addition  we will aggressively pursue cost savings opportunities  wherever possible  to conserve cash

payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years note payable   capital lease obligations    operating lease obligations    purchase obligations pension obligations open purchase orders   total    while the company s international business generates positive cash flow and represents approximately of consolidated net sales  the company has reported losses on a consolidated basis for several years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
during these years the company has secured additional capital to sustain operations through private and public sales of equity securities 
the company believes that its best prospect for returning its us and consolidated operations to profitability is through the growth in sales of the icl and cost reduction efforts in the us combined with continued growth in international markets 
in the longer term the company seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  the company is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis during fiscal the company believes that based on current cash balances  combined with expected cash from international operations  it currently has sufficient cash to meet its funding requirements at least through the first quarter of however  given its history of losses and negative cash flows  it is possible that the company will find it necessary to supplement these sources of capital with additional financing to sustain operations until the company returns to profitability 
the credit facilities are subject to various covenants  and we risk defaulting on the terms of our credit facilities 
our limited borrowing capacity could cause a shortfall in working capital or prevent us from making expenditures to expand or enhance our business 
a default on any of our credit facilities could cause our long term obligations to be accelerated  make further borrowing difficult and jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
if the company is unable to rely solely on existing debt financing and is unable to obtain additional debt financing  the company may find it necessary to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  which will largely depend on the success of the icl  proceeds from option exercises  borrowings under the company s credit facility and proceeds from the sale of common stock 
any withdrawal of support from its lenders could have serious consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity also depends  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s short term funding 
changes in the market price of our common stock affect the value of our outstanding options  and lower market prices could reduce our expected revenue from option exercises 
the business of the company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are beyond its control  including  but not limited to  those set forth above and in the other reports filed by the company with the 
table of contents securities and exchange commission 
such risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
the company recognizes revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
the company records revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  which is typically at shipping point 
the company s products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
in accordance with sab no 
 the company recognizes revenue for consignment inventory when the iol is implanted during surgery and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
the company believes its revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances 
icls are sold only to certified surgeons who have completed requisite training 
staar ships icls only for use by surgeons who have already been certified  or for use in scheduled training surgeries 
as a result  staar does not face the risk that the revenue it recognizes on shipment of icls could be reversed because of a surgeon s failure to qualify for its use 
the company generally permits returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by the company  and in good condition 
the company provides allowances for returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within the company s expectations  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of historical return experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for returns 
the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of its customers current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the 
table of contents probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
the company considers all available information in its assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors in accordance with sfas no 
r and the issuance of stock options and warrants for services from non employees in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected life of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
accounting for warrants 
the company accounts for the issuance of company derivative equity instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
the company has agreed to use its best efforts to register and maintain registration of the common shares underlying certain warrants the warrant shares that were issued by the company with debt instruments  so that the warrant holder may freely sell the warrant shares if the warrant is exercised  and the company agreed that in any event it would secure effective registration within four months of issuance 
in addition  while the relevant warrant agreement does not require cash settlement if the company fails to register the warrant shares  it does not specifically preclude cash settlement 
as a result eitf requires the company to assume that in the absence of effective registration it may be required to settle the these warrants for cash when they are exercised 
accordingly  the company s agreement to register and maintain registration of the warrant shares without express terms for settlement in the absence of effective registration is presumed to create a liability to settle these warrants in cash  requiring liability classification 
the company has issued other warrants under an agreement that expressly provides that if the company fails satisfy registration requirements the company will be obligated only to issue additional common stock as the holder s sole remedy  with no possibility of settlement in cash 
the company accounts for those warrants as equity because additional shares are the only form of settlement available to the holder 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model as the valuation model to estimate the fair value of those warrants 
the company evaluates the balance sheet classification of the warrants during each reporting period 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected life of the warrant is determined by the amount of time remaining on the original six year term of the relevant warrant agreement 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting period 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrants classified as a liability from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of other income expense 
the warrants that are accounted for as equity are only valued on the issuance date and not subsequently revalued 
once registration becomes effective for the resale of warrant shares  the company will be obligated to use its best efforts to maintain registration  and at that point the company believes it will be appropriate to reclassify the liability warrants to equity subject to reassessment of the classification at that time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for 
table of contents deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet 
net increases to the valuation allowance were   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to defend its positions 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if the company prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of its inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  the company determined that its inventory was overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company determined that its inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and the company would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and its reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  the company compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  
table of contents but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an assessment was completed under the guidance of sfas no 
for the year ended december   and no impairment was identified 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life  is not amortized  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment test using the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
and determined that its goodwill was not impaired 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
patents and licenses 
the company also has other intangible assets consisting of patents and licenses  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of december  the company capitalizes the cost of acquiring patents and licenses 
amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives since the pattern in which the economic benefits realized cannot be reasonably determined  which are based on legal and contractual provisions  and range from to years 
the company reviews patents and licenses for impairment in the same assessment discussed above in the discussion above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
no impairment was identified during the review completed in the fourth quarter of employee defined benefit plan 
the company has historically maintained a passive pension plan swiss plan covering employees of its switzerland subsidiary which was classified and accounted for as a defined contribution plan 
based on new guidance obtained in the fourth quarter of fiscal year from the swiss auditing chamber s auditing practice committee and its accounting practice committee with respect to a change in swiss pension law  the company concluded that the features of the swiss plan now conform to a defined benefit plan 
as a result  the company adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas nos 
  and r sfas effective october  this model allocates pension costs over the service period of employees in the plan 
the underlying principle is that employees render service ratably over this period  and therefore  the income statement effects of pensions should follow a similar pattern 
sfas no 
requires recognition of the funded status  or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the statement of financial position as of december   with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets  then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability 
the company conformed the pension assets and liabilities to sfas no 
and recorded a corresponding reduction of  net of tax  to the december  balance of accumulated other comprehensive income 

table of contents due to adoption of sfas no 
and the new accounting guidance relating to swiss plan  the company records a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations
