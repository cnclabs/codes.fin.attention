overview we provide a suite of technology based products and services that help community financial institutions compete more effectively with larger regional and national financial institutions 
we believe that community financial institutions  which have traditionally competed on personalized service  are facing increasing challenges to improve their operating efficiencies and grow their customer base 
these challenges include growing competition with larger national and regional banks  the emergence of non traditional competitors  the compression of margins on traditional products  the convergence of financial products into a single institution  and legislative changes accelerating the need for financial institutions to offer a wider range of products and services to their customers 
we believe that these competitive pressures are particularly acute for community financial institutions  which lack the substantial capital and specialized personnel to address their technology needs internally 
our solutions enable our clients to focus on their core competencies while we help them meet their product and technology needs 
we provide our solutions primarily on an outsourced basis 
the financial technology industry is currently characterized by significant acquisition activity  the introduction of new product and service offerings for financial institutions and an increased emphasis on security of customer data 
we believe that these trends will result in greater opportunities for providers of financial technology 
historically  we have generated our revenues primarily from participation fees  software licenses fees  maintenance fees and insurance brokerage fees derived from businessmanager  our accounts receivable financing solution  and from fees associated with our retail inventory management services product 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our consolidated revenues from businessmanager and approximately of our consolidated revenues from retail inventory management services 
we expect to continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues from these sources during in recent years  our revenues from businessmanager have declined from year to year  and this trend may continue 
given the above trends in the performance of our businessmanager and retail inventory management services products  we decided in december to broaden our strategy to add other products and services that we believed offered greater opportunity for future growth  with the goal of providing a suite of solutions primarily to community financial institutions 
we accomplished this shift in strategy by acquiring captiva  which added core data processing as well as image and item processing  ptc  which added teller automation systems  
table of contents goldleaf technologies  which added ach processing  remote capture processing  and website design and hosting  community banking systems  which added check imaging  report archival  and document imaging  datatrade  llc  which added data conversion services  remote deposit  report management  document imaging  interactive voice response  web banking  and checkscan  and alogent corporation  which added additional deposit automation solutions  remote deposit automation  atm deposit automation  cash vault deposit automation  interbank exchange  and check processing 
revenues we generate revenue from three main sources financial institution service fees  retail inventory management services fees  and other products and services 
financial institution service fees financial institution service fees include deposit automation including remote capture and processing fees  check imaging fees  ach origination and processing fees  core data processing and image processing fees  software license and maintenance fees  professional service fees  participation fees and insurance brokerage fees  leasing revenues  financial institution website design and hosting fees  report archival fees  document imaging fees  data conversion services fees  report management fees  and voice response fees 
participation fees  insurance brokerage fees and maintenance fees from our accounts receivable financing solution 
we derive revenue from two types of participation fees 
first  we earn a fee during the first days after a client financial institution implements our solution and purchases accounts receivable from its small business customers 
second  we earn an ongoing participation fee from subsequent purchases of accounts receivable by the client 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the accounts receivable that the client purchases during each month  with the second type of fee being a smaller percentage of the accounts receivable purchased 
insurance brokerage fees are derived from the sale of credit and fraud insurance products issued by a third party national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium paid to the insurance company 
we recognize these commission revenues when our financial institution clients purchase the accounts receivable covered by credit and fraud insurance policies 
core data processing and image processing fees 
we generate support and service fees from implementation services  from ongoing support services to assist the client in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software and from providing outsourced core data processing services 
we derive revenues from outsourced item and core data processing services from monthly usage fees  typically under multi year contracts with our clients 
software license and maintenance fees 
we derive software license fees from the sale of software associated with our accounts receivable financing solutions and our core data processing solution 
software license fees for our accounts receivable financing solutions consist of two components a license fee and a client training and support fee 
we receive these one time fees on the initial licensing of our program to a client financial institution 
our license agreements have terms ranging from three to five years and are renewable for subsequent terms 
we generate annual software maintenance fees from our client financial institutions starting on the first anniversary of the businessmanager license agreement and annually thereafter 
we license our core data processing product under standard license agreements that typically provide the client with a non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software 
we generate annual software maintenance fees from our client financial institutions starting on the first anniversary of the core data processing license agreement and annually thereafter 

table of contents ach origination and processing  remote capture and deposit processing fees 
we license these products via up front fees to financial institutions at the time of execution of the agreements  which are typically five year contracts 
we recognize these up front fees when we complete customer implementation  which typically occurs within the first thirty days after contract execution 
we also generate monthly fees for hosting services from each originator of ach transactions  and we receive fees for each ach transaction that occurs each month 
we offer annual hosting and maintenance support to all of our financial institution clients for a fee that is generally equal to to of the up front fees 
leasing revenues 
we offer equipment leasing services to some of our clients 
we have no credit risk exposure for these leases 
our leases fall into two categories direct financing leases and operating leases 
for direct financing leases  the investment in direct financing leases caption consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments due during the remaining term of the lease and unguaranteed residual value of the leased asset 
we record the difference between this sum and the cost of the leased asset as unearned income 
we amortize unearned income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
for leases classified as operating leases  we record the leased asset at cost  depreciate the leased asset  and record lease payments as rent income during the period earned 
financial institution website design and hosting fees 
we offer website design and hosting services to financial institutions  although we do not host any confidential bank data on our servers 
the revenues we generate for these services consist of up front fees associated with the design and implementation of each website and monthly hosting fees for hosting each website in our data center 
document and check imaging 
we offer document management products to help banks and corporations organize and archive masses of business information 
imaging software is offered as a network based system for scalable document imaging  scanning  and storage solutions 
we earn license fees from the sale of software as well as installation and training fees 
these fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of the installation of the software 
we also generate annual software maintenance fees upon the installation completion 
data conversion services 
we provide digital to digital conversion and migration services for document images  check images  computer reports cold and data 
we charge a fee per volume count of data to be converted 
we recognize revenue for these services upon completion of the conversion and delivery of the converted data 
report management  report archive and voice response services 
our report management software provides digital report storage and management solutions to banks and corporations to securely store and retrieve digital report information via network or web connectivity 
our voice response services offer customers access to information on all types of accounts to initiate transactions  check on other products and services and receive statement and invoice information through simple touchtone or speech commands 
similar to our document imaging products  we earn license fees from the sale of software as well as installation  implementation  testing  and training fees 
we generate annual software maintenance fees upon completion of the installation or as services are provided 
merchant and branch capture 
with our acquisition of datatrade  we also offer merchant capture as a remote deposit application that provides a bank s commercial customers a means to capture check images  make electronic deposits  and improve treasury operations 
additionally  our remote deposit solutions provide banks with branch capture and a full function lockbox remittance application 
we license these products via up front license fees as well as installation  testing  and training fees 
we recognize these fees when installation is complete or as services are provided 
retail inventory management services we generate retail inventory management services revenue from fees we charge primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
we use proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from fees associated with our accounts receivable financing solutions and retail inventory management services 
while we believe that our acquisitions and product diversification will enable us to derive revenues from a broader mix of products and services  we anticipate that revenues derived from our accounts receivable solutions and inventory management services will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in and for a period thereafter

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates on a periodic basis 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and other related generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is probable 
financial institution service fees 
we earn two types of participation fees 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client financial institution purchases from its small business customers during each month 
participation fees are recognized as earned  which is based upon the transaction dates of financial institution purchases from its small business customers 
we recognize insurance brokerage fee revenues when our financial institution clients purchase the accounts receivable covered by credit and fraud insurance policies and earn our fees based on a percentage of the premium paid to the insurance company 
we generate maintenance fees and other revenues from several ancillary products and services that we provide to our client financial institutions ratably over a month period beginning on the first anniversary of the agreement with our client 
for customers that install our core data processing system at their location  we recognize revenues from the installation and training for the system as we provide the installation and training services 
in addition  we charge an annual software maintenance fee  which we recognize ratably over the year to which it relates 
we recognize core data processing and image processing fees as we perform services for our clients 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our core data processing systems 
we recognize revenue for licensing these systems in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
we recognize the software license after we have signed a non cancelable license agreement  have installed the products and have fulfilled all significant obligations to the client under the agreement 
our acquisition of goldleaf technologies added three primary products from which we earn revenues ach origination and processing  remote deposit  and website design and hosting 
we describe the current revenue recognition policies for these products below 

table of contents we account for the ach and remote deposit products in accordance with sop we license these products under automatically renewing agreements  which allow our customers to use the software for the term of the agreement  typically five years  and each renewal period 
typically  there is an up front fee  an annual or monthly maintenance and hosting fees for each year of the contract  and per originator and per transaction fees for processing of ach and remote deposit transactions 
we also offer training services on a per training day basis if the customer requests training 
during the second quarter of  we began the process of modifying goldleaf technologies ach and remote deposit contracts entered into after the january  acquisition date 
the primary modification allows customers of these products to take possession of the software for use on an in house basis versus the primary application service provider basis that goldleaf technologies had historically employed 
in accordance with the guidance provided in eitf no 
 application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored in another entity s hardware  this change in contractual terms results in a change in the applicable accounting literature from eitf to sop  as modified by sops and under sop  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe has been established for all undelivered elements  the residual method applies 
under the residual method  the fair value of each undelivered element is deferred  and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
therefore  in april  we began recognizing the up front fees when all of the revenue recognition criteria in paragraph of sop have been met  which is normally upon customer implementation 
revenue related to the undelivered elements is recognized as the services are delivered 
included in revenue for the year ended december  is approximately million related to up front fees for contracts entered into during had we not adopted this change  the total of million in additional revenue recognized in would have been spread over the estimated life of the client relationships  which is approximately months 
the effect of this change on how we recognize revenue from sales of these products in future years will be to accelerate the amount of revenue we recognize in each year in which we sell the products  although the precise amount will vary depending on the number and dollar amount of our contracts 
the annual maintenance fee covers telephone support and all unspecified software enhancements and upgrades 
the annual hosting fee covers the actual hosting of the software products on our servers  which are accessed by our customers 
we defer both the annual maintenance fees and the hosting fees and recognize them in income over the one year life of the maintenance and hosting agreements 
we recognize monthly maintenance and hosting fees on a monthly basis as earned and recognize transaction fees monthly as the transactions occur 
we recognize training revenue when we deliver the training services when delivered separately 
we offer financial institution website design services as well as hosting services for the website once design is complete 
we charge an up front fee for the design services and a monthly website hosting fee each month of the contract  which is typically five years 
the monthly hosting fee typically includes a limited amount of website maintenance hours each month 
we bill for any maintenance work exceeding the designated number of hours included in the monthly hosting fee at an agreed to hourly rate as the services are rendered 
we account for the website design and hosting services in accordance with eitf no 
during july  the company was able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements the hosting and support services 
as a result  the up front fee for the design services is recognized at the time the customer website is completed and operational 
included in revenues are approximately  related to up front fees sold after the acquisition date for completed customer websites that had previously been deferred 
had the company not adopted this change  the total of  in additional revenue in would have been spread over the estimated life of the client relationships  which is approximately months 
the effect of this change on how the company recognizes revenue from sales of these products in future years will be to accelerate the amount of revenue it recognizes in each year in which it sells the products  although the precise amount will vary depending on the number and dollar amount of its contracts 
monthly hosting and maintenance revenues are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
software license fees for our accounts receivable financing solution consist of two components a license fee and a client training and support fee 
we receive these one time fees on the initial licensing of our program to a client financial institution 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the client agreement 
we recognize the client training and support fee ratably over a four month service period after activation of the license agreement 
revenue recognition rules for up front fees are complex and require interpretation and judgment on the part of management 
each of our products containing software elements  including core data processing  ach processing  remote capture processing  accounts receivable financing and teller automation systems  requires the establishment of vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for each element of the arrangement 
determining each element of an agreement and establishing vsoe can be complex 
if we modify our contract terms to an extent that changes our vsoe conclusions  our revenue recognition practices could be materially affected 
we recognize leasing revenues for both direct financing and operating leases 
for direct financing leases  the investment in direct financing leases caption consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments due during the remaining term of the lease and unguaranteed residual value of the leased asset 
we record the difference between the total above and the cost of the leased asset as unearned income 
we amortize unearned income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
there is a significant amount of judgment involved in estimated residual values of leased assets at the inception of each lease 
management bases these estimates primarily on historical experience  however  changes in the economy or product obsolescence could adversely affect the residual values actually obtainable 
we monitor residual values quarterly to re assess the recorded amounts 
in the event our assumptions change regarding the amounts expected to be realized  we could incur substantial losses related to leased assets 
for leases classified as operating leases  we record the leased asset at cost and depreciate the leased asset 
we record lease payments as rent income during the period earned 
retail inventory management services 
we recognize revenues for our retail inventory management services as the transactions occur and as we perform merchandising and forecasting services 
other products and services 
revenues from other products and services consist of revenues from the sale of premium gifts related to our depositplus product  our direct mail program  scanner device sales related to our remote deposit product  other ancillary hardware sales  and revenues from the sale of business forms 
we record revenues from our depositplus direct mail campaign as the customer of our client financial institution opens a checking account and receives a premium gift

table of contents software development costs we expense software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products as we incur those expenses until technological feasibility has been established 
after that point  we capitalize any additional costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of internally used software when application development begins in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which is generally the point when we have completed research and development  we have established project feasibility  and management has approved a development plan 
many of the costs capitalized for internally used software relate to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems 
if the development costs will result in specific additional functionality of the existing system  we capitalize these costs at the point that application development begins 
we amortize capitalized software development costs on a straight line basis over their useful lives  generally three years 
the key assumptions and estimates for this accounting policy relate to determining when we have achieved technological feasibility and whether the project being undertaken is one that will be marketable or enhance the marketability of an existing product for externally marketed software and whether the project will result in additional functionality for internal use software projects 
management consults monthly with all project managers to ensure that management understands the scope and expected results of each project to make a judgment on whether a particular project meets the requirements outlined in the authoritative accounting literature described above 
we capitalize interest on new software products and enhancements in development 
interest is capitalized at our weighted average interest rate on our revolving line of credit 
interest capitalization ends when the new product or enhancement is released 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the asset and liability method  meaning that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we evaluate our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes for us primarily relate to nols  which require considerable judgment regarding whether we will ultimately realize them 
for us  this judgment relies largely on whether we expect to have sufficient taxable income in future years that will allow for full use of the nols we record 
in order to realize the nols recorded as a deferred tax asset at december   we will have to generate approximately million of taxable income in future periods 
our recent historical taxable income is not sufficient to meet this minimum level of pre tax profitability  however we do believe that future periods will provide sufficient taxable income levels to realize the recorded nols 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  against certain of the company s state nol deferred tax assets at december  the other key assumption affecting the amount of nols we record as a deferred tax asset is the estimated restriction in usage due to section of the internal revenue code 
section is very complex  requiring significant expertise and professional judgment to properly evaluate its effect on our usable nols 
if our assumptions change  we could have significant increases in income tax expense and reductions in deferred tax assets and operating cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
requires a company to evaluate all uncertain tax positions and determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the positions 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions 
we adopted fin no 
on january  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations our business combinations require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in general  we determine the fair values based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities  which information we substantiate  and valuations using standard valuation techniques 
the valuations have been based primarily on future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
these future cash flow projections are highly subjective  and changes in these projections could materially affect the amounts calculated for intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets including goodwill 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over their expected economic lives  generally ranging from three to ten years except for goodwill  which is not amortized 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents we also perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at december we assess potential impairment through a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit versus its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends  product development cycles  and estimated future cash flows 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could cause a material effect on our financial statements

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million for the acquisition of captiva and million for the acquisition of kvi capital 
cash from financing activities during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million and was attributable primarily to borrowings of million from our amended and restated syndicated credit facility and proceeds of million from our non recourse lease notes  offset by million in repayments on non recourse lease notes payable   in repayments on capital lease obligations and a  payment on the note payable to former president of gti  as a portion of the consideration paid to him for executing an employment agreement with the company 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million and was attributable primarily to proceeds received from the sale of million new common shares net of offering expenses totaling million and net new borrowings of approximately million from our amended and restated credit facility with bank of america

during  net cash provided by financing activities was million and was attributable primarily to net additional borrowings of million offset by preferred dividends of million 

table of contents analysis of changes in working capital as of december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to working capital of approximately million as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and an increase of million in deferred revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of  in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued liabilities 
these changes were primarily the result of completing the acquisitions in we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our amended and restated credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility throughout there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations or that we will remain in compliance with the new covenants 
non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  the following is a schedule of our obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands revolving line of credit capital lease obligations non recourse lease notes payable operating leases total contractual cash obligations in the future  we may acquire businesses or products that are complementary to our business  although we cannot be certain that we will make any acquisitions 
the need for cash to finance additional working capital or to make acquisitions may cause us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot be certain that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that our need for higher levels of working capital will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in december  in connection with our acquisition of captiva  we amended the bank of america credit facility to convert it to a million revolving line of credit  and we issued a million unsecured senior subordinated note and common stock warrants to lightyear 
we paid lightyear a fee of  in connection with this transaction and agreed to reimburse lightyear for its legal fees up to  as of december   no amount was outstanding under the bank of america credit facility 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial and non financial covenants contained in the bank of america credit facility throughout on january   we entered into an amended and restated million credit facility with bank of america 
we used the proceeds of the facility on january  to buy goldleaf technologies 
in connection with the january amendment and restatement of the bank of america credit facility the lightyear fund  lp  an affiliate of lightyear  guaranteed a million term loan included in the facility that was due july  and we agreed to pay a fee of  to the lightyear fund  lp and to reimburse the lightyear fund  lp for up to  of its expenses in connection with this guaranty  lightyear exchanged its senior subordinated million note for  shares of our series c preferred stock  which decreased our debt by million but added that same amount in redeemable preferred stock  and we amended and restated the common stock warrants that we issued to lightyear in december in connection with the lightyear note 
the series c preferred stock issued to lightyear had a mandatory redemption date of december  at a redemption price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends  and had a annual dividend rate that would have increased to on june  as discussed elsewhere in this form k  on october   all of the series c preferred stock outstanding was redeemed with cash generated from our secondary public offering 
we subsequently amended the bank of america credit facility again in april to provide for an additional million in short term loans 
we further amended the bank of america credit facility in june to increase the total facility to million  consisting of the million term a note  the million term b note and a million revolving credit line 
the june amendment also eliminated the scheduled quarterly term a note payments of  on june    on both september  and december   and  per quarter thereafter until maturity 
on august   we again amended the bank of america credit facility to reduce the interest rate on the term b note from libor plus to libor plus 
we repaid the million outstanding under our credit facility with proceeds from our common stock offering and over allotment option discussed elsewhere in this form k 
upon repayment of the million outstanding  our credit facility converted automatically to a million revolving credit facility 
on november   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  the peoples bank  and wachovia bank 
the second amended and restated credit agreement amended and restated in its entirety the amended and restated credit agreement dated january  and as further amended on february   april   may   june   and august  in the second amended and restated credit agreement the parties thereto agreed to certain changes from the existing credit agreement  including the following 
table of contents the credit facility was converted to a revolving credit facility in the amount of million  an increase of million over the previously existing credit facility  the maturity of the credit facility was extended from january  to november  with an option  conditioned upon the consent of the lenders  to extend the maturity for additional months  the funded debt to ebitda ratio was increased from to  wachovia bank  na joined as a participant  and the limit on capital expenditures was increased from million to million per fiscal year 
the second amended and restated credit agreement contains financial covenants  including the maintenance of financial ratios and limits on capital expenditures 
we were required to maintain on a quarterly basis a ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceeding we were also required to maintain for the calendar month period ending on the last day of each calendar quarter  a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of in addition  we were prohibited from acquiring fixed assets other than any equipment purchased by kvi capital with proceeds of non recourse loans having a value greater than million during any month period ending with each fiscal quarter

 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
requires a company to evaluate all uncertain tax positions and determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
there was no cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
the fsp 
fsp amended sfas no 
 to delay the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
fsp defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp the company is subject to the remaining provisions of sfas no 
beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent report date 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effects of sfas no 
 however at this time we do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material affect on our operating results or consolidated financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r generally retains the underlying concepts of sfas because it requires all business combinations to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but it changes how the acquisition method of accounting is applied in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred  contingent consideration will be recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect the income tax provision 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all of our business combinations with an acquisition date on or after january   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
early adoption is not permitted 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for us as of january  sfas no 
amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled  and presented within equity  but separate from the parent s equity  in the consolidated statement of financial position 
it also requires that consolidated net income be reported including the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and that the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
based on our initial analysis  sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client financial institutions 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
currently  our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations pursuant to the second amended and restated bank of america credit agreement  as amended 
as of december   our outstanding line of credit totaled million 
an increase of basis points under the bank of america credit facility will impact our future cash flows by approximately  annually
