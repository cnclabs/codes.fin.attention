overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible pv modules using proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately million in revenues  none of which came from our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
under our current business plan  we expect losses to continue through at least to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity financings 
our path to commercialization is defined by a highly disciplined  staged progression based upon the achievement of key milestones 
we completed construction of a mw production line on schedule in december after having consistently achieved pv cell conversion efficiencies of approximately to  and pv module conversion efficiencies of approximately to  and as high as  in a pre production prototyping and test facility that we have operated since the fourth quarter of conversion efficiency is the percentage of energy from absorbed light that a device is able to convert into electrical energy 
over time and with further refinement of our existing processes  we believe that our pv modules should be able to consistently achieve efficiencies of to 
we are now testing and qualifying our mw production line in anticipation of commencing limited commercial production during the second quarter of with an emphasis on module testing and further optimization of production yield 
our production line incorporates into an integrated process each of the discrete manufacturing steps that have been previously tested in our pre production prototyping and test facility 
our manufacturing expansion plan entails the design  installation  qualification  testing and operation of additional production tools to increase our rated production capacity  and contemplates the addition of approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of and another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of we therefore expect to have approximately mw of rated production capacity in place by the end of rated production capacity refers to our expected level of annual production upon optimizing our production process and is based on assumed production yields and module efficiencies 
the actual production levels that we are able to realize at any point during our planned expansion will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to optimize our production process to achieve targeted production yields and module efficiencies 
see risk factors including risk factors we have a limited history of operations  have not generated any revenue from operations and have not commenced commercial production of our pv modules 
mw production line status the major modifications to our building and facilities in littleton  colorado to accommodate the new mw production line were completed  and all the requisite production tools and support equipment were delivered and installed  by the fourth quarter we are currently qualifying the production tools for the following manufacturing processes manufacturing process manufacturing tool thin film vacuum coating of molybdenum back contact roll to roll tool for sputtering thin film vacuum coating of copper  indium  gallium  selenium roll to roll tool for thermal evaporation chemical spray coating of deionized water and cadmium sulfide roll to roll tool for chemical treatment thin film vacuum coating of transparent conductive oxide tco roll to roll tool for sputtering laser patterning and ink printing of modules roll to roll monolithic integration tool the following diagram is a general illustration of our manufacturing process graphic other tools  including laminators  solar simulators and environmental testing chambers  and characterization and quality control equipment have been installed and qualified and comprise the remainder of the major equipment for our mw production line 
each tool on the production line must be individually qualified  and operators must be trained to operate each tool within designed control limits that we believe are necessary to ensure production of quality products 
when each tool is operating properly and within set standards  we intend to commence operation of the entire mw production line as an integrated process and to begin manufacturing modules in order to achieve an initial operating capability ioc 
our goal is to achieve ioc by the end of the first quarter in  by which time we expect to understand better any operational performance issues with the production tools  quality issues and initial product performance and efficiency levels 
during the second quarter of  we intend to focus on manufacturing optimization to achieve desired initial production yields of or greater and module efficiencies of to 
in order to achieve these objectives  we must successfully transition the manufacturing processes and performance levels achieved with our prototyping tools to the mw production line throughout the first and second quarters of our principal activities during will be to qualify our production tools and manufacturing processes  and to produce product for the following purposes internal product development  testing and qualification  and external product testing to gain ul  iec and t v certifications  one or more of which is necessary for some product and customer applications 
other product uses include demonstrations  joint product development  limited sales and further market development with new strategic partners and customers 
successful accomplishment of our objectives in these areas is necessary to support the commencement of full scale manufacturing at the mw level and to make progress consistent with our current commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan 
commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan we intend to be the first company to manufacture large  roll format  pv modules in commercial quantities that use cigs on a flexible  plastic substrate 
our manufacturing expansion plan entails the design  installation  qualification  testing and operation of additional production tools to increase our rated production capacity 
we intend to incrementally expand our aggregate production capacity to mw by attaining the following milestones within the time frames indicated second quarter of commence limited commercial production on mw production line 
third quarter of begin certification and qualification of products through ul  iec and t v 
third quarter of begin procuring production tools for the first mw of incremental rated capacity 
fourth quarter of complete certification of products from mw production line 
third quarter of begin procuring production tools for the second mw of incremental rated capacity 
fourth quarter of complete qualification of production tools for the first mw of incremental rated capacity and commence production at mw of aggregate rated capacity 
third quarter of begin procuring production tools for the final mw of incremental rated capacity 
fourth quarter of complete qualification of production tools for the second mw of incremental rated capacity and commence production at mw of aggregate rated capacity 
fourth quarter of complete qualification of production tools for the final mw of incremental rated capacity and commence production at mw of aggregate rated capacity 
although we currently plan to expand our production capacity in accordance with the timeline above  the actual timing and amount of production capacity that we install may significantly deviate from the above plan due to market conditions  availability of financing  timeliness of delivery of production tools  product performance and other factors described in this annual report 
see significant trends  uncertainties and challenges below  and risk factors including risk factors we have a limited history of operations  have not generated any revenue from operations and have not commenced commercial production of our pv modules 
although we do not expect that minor delays in product certifications would significantly affect our ability to continue developing product applications with our customers  delays that extend significantly into likely would impact our ability to develop demand for our pv modules  and would affect our planned sales and results of operations in  when we expect to have commenced production using our planned production tools for approximately mw of rated capacity 
using our mw production line as a model  we have commenced engineering and development of our planned production tools for approximately mw of rated capacity 
we plan to procure these production tools by the third quarter of  and to complete installation of the production tools by the end of the second quarter of allowing six months to qualify the tools and achieve ioc  we plan to commence production at mw of rated capacity by the end of in order to qualify approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  we intend to purchase and install production tools that will process one third meter wide plastic rolls identical to those used in our existing mw production line 
significant delays in the qualification of the mw production line and or delays in the delivery  installation and qualification of additional production tools may impact our real and projected product sales in further  satisfactory performance of our mw production line is a precursor to achieving our commercial production targets 
we expect that the production tools used for the next approximately mw of rated capacity and for future capacity expansions will be engineered to process larger one meter wide rolls  and we have initiated engineering and development of production tools to support our planned expansion to mw of rated capacity 
successfully transitioning to one meter wide rolls should significantly increase our throughput  thereby reducing the number of manufacturing tools and  hence  the amount of capital expenditures required for equipment and facilities 
generally speaking  we believe that all other process variables  such as speed  thickness and composition  should remain unchanged 
based upon discussions with our equipment suppliers  we have identified deposition of the cigs layer in the one meter wide format as the most challenging aspect of transitioning to one meter wide rolls  consequently  we have initiated the development of a one meter wide prototype cigs production tool to enable us to begin evaluating and testing one meter wide area deposition sources and process control systems 
this prototype production tool is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of  which under our current schedule allows for nine months of testing and evaluation prior to committing the capital in to procure the one meter format production tools to support further expansion to approximately mw of rated capacity 
in addition  we anticipate that our planned expansion to approximately mw of total rated capacity will require additional capital 
see risk factors our planned expansion to approximately mw of rated capacity will require additional capital which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms  if at all  or without dilution to our stockholders 
in february  we acquired an approximately  square foot manufacturing and office facility in thornton  colorado  for approximately million 
the purchase was financed in part by a promissory note  deed of trust and construction loan agreement with chfa  which provide us borrowing availability of up to million for the building and building improvements 
we paid approximately million in cash and were advanced approximately million from chfa to fund the initial acquisition of the property 
the construction loan terms are to pay interest at on only the drawn principal amount until january   at which time the construction loan will be refinanced by a permanent loan 
the permanent loan will have an interest rate of and the principal will be amortized over a period of approximately years and months consistent with a maturity date years after the incurrence of the construction loan on february  the terms of the permanent loan are specified in a chfa construction and permanent loan commitment dated january  in  we intend to draw down the available remaining balance of the construction loan  approximately million  to pay for building improvements 
capital equipment expenditures and manufacturing costs since our formation in october  most of our cash outlays have gone toward the investment in capital equipment necessary to develop our manufacturing capabilities for producing the commercial products we envision 
we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future as we expand to approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of we will require additional capital and additional facilities to achieve our manufacturing expansion plans 
if we are unable to secure the necessary capital or to manage the disbursement of capital taking into consideration any unforeseen factors  such as cost increases from our equipment suppliers and the potential continued devaluation of the us dollar against foreign currencies  our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity as planned  as well as our financial performance and results of operations  may be adversely affected 
our major equipment suppliers are located in japan  the united kingdom and germany 
the recent downward trend of the us dollar against the yen  the british pound and the euro has resulted in an increase in our estimated and projected capital expenditure requirements 
although the devaluation of the dollar directly affects our capital outlays  it generally strengthens the value of our products relative to those of many of our foreign competitors to the extent that our production costs are incurred in us dollars 
we currently expect the capital expenditures needed to support the first mw of rated capacity to be approximately million to million for property  plant and equipment and approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses 
in order to install the next mw of rated capacity  we expect that we will require another approximately million to million for property  plant and equipment and approximately million for installation  qualification and other associated pre operating expenses 
assuming optimized run rate production yields and module efficiencies  we expect our pv module manufacturing cash costs to be approximately per watt when operating at mw of rated capacity and approximately per watt when operating at mw of rated capacity 
to manage the uncertainties related to the procurement of capital equipment  we have continued to work closely with our equipment suppliers to complete the engineering of our new tools and refine the estimates of our planned capital outlays 
the production tool costs are subject to change until we place firm procurement orders with our suppliers  which we expect will occur beginning the third quarter of to manage the fluctuations of foreign exchange rates  we procure equipment from japan under contract terms based upon us dollars at the time of contract 
for equipment procured in europe  we intend to negotiate with our suppliers to achieve similar terms 
although we do not currently engage in any foreign currency hedging activities  we intend to consider the merits of using financial instruments to hedge against such uncertainties in the future 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations are our ability to successfully qualify our mw production line and obtain necessary or desired certifications for our pv modules  our ability to expand production in accordance with our plans set forth above under commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan to add approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of and another approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of  and to achieve certifications of our planned pv modules  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to consummate strategic relationships with key partners  including oems  system integrators and distributors who deal directly with end users in the bipv  eipv and commodity solar panel markets  the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our capital equipment purchases  manufacturing costs and the price of our planned pv modules  and our ability to manage the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities  operations and personnel 
other trends  uncertainties and challenges may exist and are discussed elsewhere in this annual report  including under the heading risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of accounting policies that have been applied to the financial statements presented can be found in the notes thereto 
we consider certain of these accounting policies to be critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require judgments on the part of management about matters that are uncertain 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the financial information basis of presentation our activities to date have substantially consisted of raising capital  research and development  and the development of a mw production line 
revenues to date have been generated from our government research and development r d contracts and have not been significant 
our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules have not yet commenced 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises 
short term investments our short term investments  which are classified as available for sale securities  are invested in high grade variable rate demand notes  which have a final maturity date of up to years but whose interest rates are reset at varying intervals typically between and days 
unlike auction rate securities  variable rate demand notes can be readily liquidated at any interest rate reset date  either by putting them back to the original issuer or by putting them to a third party re marketer as generally provided in the original prospectus 
to date  we have always been able to redeem our holdings of these securities in accordance with their terms  and we believe that the risk of non redemption is minimal 
consequently  these securities are available for use to support the current cash needs of our operations  and in accordance with accounting research bulletin  they are classified as short term investments 
revenue recognition revenue to date is from our government research and development contracts under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the firm fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
income taxes in july  the fasb financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates from the date of enactment 
stock based compensation our accounts for share based payments under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers and directors  and consultants  including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our statements of operations 
stock based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant under sfas r  we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because our employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact our fair value determination 
the guidance in sfas r is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and certain reclassifications have been made to the financial information to conform to the presentation 
such reclassifications had no effect on net loss and are related to reclassifying costs between r d expenses and general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations for the year ended december  our activities to date have substantially consisted of raising capital  business and product development  research and development and the development of our mw production line 
research and development contract revenues 
our r d contract revenues were  for the year ended december  there were no r d contract revenues for the year ended december  a majority of our revenues during the year ended december  were revenues earned on our government r d contracts novated january  from itn and new government r d contracts awarded to us in research and development expenses 
r d expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is comprised of  related to personnel  materials and facilities required to optimize our manufacturing processes in advance of commencing full scale production on our mw production line and  of direct costs and related overhead on our government r d contracts that began on january  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase of  is comprised of two components  an increase in corporate g a expenses of  and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of  the increase in corporate g a expenses corresponds with our increase in headcount and increases in corporate activity such as legal  sec reporting  stock and corporate registration fees  travel and insurance during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  non cash stock based compensation for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the significant increase in stock compensation expense for the year ended december  is primarily due to the requirements of sfas r and eitf to generally measure stock based compensation to non employees as vesting occurs and for unvested shares at the balance sheet date 
since our stock price as of december  was significantly higher than as of december   this requirement resulted in an increased fair value calculation related to stock based payments to non employees 
additional grants of our stock options during also contributed to the increase 
interest expense 
interest expense was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  interest expense in resulted from interest on the bridge loan notes and related bridge rights and financing transactions of which  was non cash related to the valuation and subsequent amortization of the bridge loan rights 
in july  the bridge loan was repaid in full with the proceeds from our initial public offering ipo 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  interest income represents interest on cash and short term investments 
our short term investments  which are classified as available for sale securities  are invested in high grade variable rate demand notes  which have a final maturity date of up to years but whose interest rates are reset at varying intervals typically between and days 
net loss 
our net loss was  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase in net loss of  this increase can be summarized in variances in significant account activity as follows increase decrease to net loss for the year ended december  r d contract revenues  r d expenses manufacturing r d  government r d  g a expenses corporate g a  non cash stock based compensation  interest expense  interest income  increase to net loss  liquidity and capital resources on july   we completed our ipo of  units  each unit consisted of one share of our common stock  one redeemable class a warrant  with an expiration date of july  and an exercise price of per share  and two non redeemable class b warrants  each with an expiration date of july  and an exercise price of per share 
the initial public offering price was per unit 
our net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
in the fiscal year ended december   we completed the following financing transactions on march   we completed a private placement of securities whereby norsk hydro purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  for a interest in us 
in connection with the private placement  norsk hydro was granted two options  which expire on june   to purchase additional shares and warrants 
on may   we publicly announced our intention to redeem our outstanding class a warrants at per warrant 
the exercise period ended june  during the exercise period   of our class a warrants of the total outstanding were exercised for an equal number of shares of common stock  and we received approximately million in proceeds 
all outstanding class a warrants that were not exercised before june  were or may be redeemed by us at per warrant for a total cost of approximately  on august   norsk hydro acquired an additional  restricted shares of our common stock and  class b warrants upon exercise of one of the options granted to norsk hydro on march  gross proceeds to us were approximately million  and reflected per share and per warrant purchase prices equal to the average of the closing bids of each security  as reported by nasdaq  for the five consecutive trading days preceding exercise 
after acquiring these additional shares  norsk hydro again held of each of our total outstanding common shares and class b warrants  after its ownership percentage had been diluted as the result of the exercise and redemption of class a warrants subsequent to march  pursuant to its other option  until june   norsk hydro has the opportunity to purchase additional shares and class b warrants  generally at prevailing market prices at the time of exercise  to enable it to hold up to of each class of security 
after expiration of this option  norsk hydro will no longer be restricted to a maximum holding in the company and may purchase our securities in the open market 
in june and september  a total of  class b public warrants were exercised resulting in proceeds to us of  in september  october and november  warrants that had been issued to the representative of the underwriters in our ipo  were exercised resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock and  class b warrants for total proceeds to us of approximately million 
in january  approximately million of existing government funded r d contracts were novated from itn to us together with the transfer of related personnel 
the transferred contracts had remaining future revenues of approximately million 
during  we were awarded approximately million of additional contracts under new r d government funded contract awards or modifications to existing r d contracts 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million in revenues on our existing r d contracts  which revenues are expected to be recognized during the contracts periods of performance in and for the year ended december   our cash used in operations was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   approximately million had been expended in capital for our mw production line  facility modifications  and office and research and development equipment 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments  approximately million of which will be used for final progress payments to our equipment suppliers on our mw production line and approximately million of which is committed for a manufacturing research and development tool in conjunction with production tools to support approximately mw of incremental rated production capacity 
during  the use of cash for operational expenses averaged approximately  per month and related to pre manufacturing activities  research and technology development  business development and general corporate expenses 
we expect these operational expenses to increase in as we commence commercial production and increase the size of our workforce 
average monthly operational expense for of approximately  is net of average monthly r d revenues from our government contracts of approximately  and average monthly interest income of approximately  without the offset of interest income  actual monthly operational costs were higher than in and higher than previously anticipated due to the acceleration of our plans to scale up manufacturing 
a significant component of our costs related to the development and production of product prototypes utilizing existing research and development process tools to help us solidify process techniques and qualify product performance in advance of the build out of the mw production line 
we also incurred additional costs for investor relations  business development and marketing communications support to strengthen our shareholder relations  support our anticipated government program activities  and support implementing our market strategies 
we anticipate that our operational expenditures will continue to increase throughout and due to the planned hiring of additional personnel to help our mw production line reach its operating potential and in connection with our planned expansion of manufacturing capacity 
as of february   we had full time employees of which were manufacturing personnel 
we plan to increase our staff in to approximately to people  principally in manufacturing  business development and sales and marketing 
we have acquired all of the capital equipment required for the mw production line and expect to make final payments in the first quarter of the capital outlays shown below represent estimated and actual costs in connection with our mw production line and production facility modifications stage of development completion estimated future capital outlay actual capital outlay completion of engineering specifications rd qtr facility and equipment construction progress payments th qtr  progress payments st qtr  progress payments nd qtr  progress payments rd qtr  progress and final payments th qtr  progress and final payments st qtr est  qualification and ioc st qtr est limited production capability nd qtr est total   we expect to commence limited commercial production on our mw production line in the second quarter of we do not expect that our sales revenue from the mw production line will be sufficient to support our operations and cash requirements  and it is unlikely that our sales revenue will support our operating cash requirements unless we achieve actual production capacity of at least mw per year 
we intend to use our existing cash to build our operational infrastructure and to begin development of manufacturing capacity necessary to produce pv modules for sale into our target markets 
we expect our current cash balance to be sufficient to cover our operational expenditures through based on currently known factors  although we will need to raise capital in in order to purchase the production tools necessary to achieve approximately mw of rated capacity by the end of off balance sheet transactions we have no off balance sheet transactions and had none in item a
