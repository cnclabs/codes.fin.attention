item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview our investment strategy we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on february  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies  many of which are corporations that do not have publicly rated debt 
we have in the past entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years and built in rental increases 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or to provide mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
at december   we owned properties totaling approximately million square feet  and had one mortgage loan outstanding 
all of our properties are fully leased and all tenants and borrowers are current and paying in accordance with their leases and loan  respectively 
the total gross investment in these acquisitions and the mortgage loan investment was approximately million 
recent events investment activities during the year ended december   we acquired properties and one leasehold interest totaling approximately  square feet  for a total gross investment of approximately million 
financing activities during the year ended december   we borrowed approximately million pursuant to four long term notes payable collateralized by security interests in of our properties  closed a one year term loan with keybank for million  and borrowed million under our line of credit  of which million remained outstanding at december   in order to fund acquisitions during the year 
our investment adviser and administrator gladstone management corporation  or our adviser  is led by a management team which has extensive experience in our lines of business 
our adviser also has a wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone administration  llc  or the administrator  which employs our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  controller  treasurer and their respective staffs 
all of our executive officers are officers or directors  or both  of our adviser and our administrator 
our adviser and administrator also provide investment advisory and administrative services to our affiliates  gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation  both publicly traded business development companies  as well as gladstone land corporation  a private agricultural real estate company 
all of our directors and executive officers serve as either directors or executive officers  or both  of gladstone capital corporation and gladstone investment corporation 
in the future  our adviser may provide investment advisory and administrative services to other funds  both public and private  of which it is the sponsor 
our adviser was organized as a corporation under the laws of the state of delaware on july   and is a registered investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended 
our adviser is headquartered in mclean  virginia  a suburb of washington dc  and also has offices in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  illinois  texas and washington 
investment advisory and administration agreements we have been externally managed pursuant to a contractual investment advisory arrangement with our adviser  under which our adviser has directly employed all of our personnel and paid its payroll  benefits  and general expenses directly 
our initial investment advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the initial advisory agreement  was in place from august  through december  on january   we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement with our adviser  which we refer to as the amended advisory agreement  and an administration agreement  which we refer to as the administration agreement  with our administrator 
under the terms of the initial advisory agreement and the amended advisory agreement  we were and remain responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include legal  accounting  interest on short term debt and mortgages  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  stockholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
during the years ended december   and  the total amount of these expenses that we incurred was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
all of these charges are incurred directly by us rather than by our adviser for our benefit 
accordingly  we did not make any reimbursements to our adviser for these amounts 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
in the event that any of these expenses are incurred on our behalf by our adviser  we are required to reimburse our adviser on a dollar for dollar basis for all such amounts 
during the years ended december    and  none of these expenses were incurred by our adviser or by us directly 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make  and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
we do not presently expect that our adviser will incur any of these fees on our behalf 
management services and fees under the initial advisory agreement pursuant to the initial advisory agreement  we were required to reimburse our adviser for our pro rata share of our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses on an employee by employee basis  based on the percentage of each employee s time devoted to our matters 
during the years ended december   and  these expenses were approximately million and million  respectively 
we were also required to reimburse our adviser for our pro rata portion of all other expenses of our adviser not reimbursed under the arrangements described above  which we refer to as overhead expenses  equal to the total overhead expenses of our adviser  multiplied by the ratio of hours worked by our adviser s employees on our projects to the total hours worked by our adviser s employees 
however  we were only required to reimburse our adviser for our portion of its overhead expenses if the amount of payroll and benefits we reimbursed to our adviser was less than of our average invested assets for the year 
additionally  we were only required to reimburse our adviser for overhead expenses up to the point that reimbursed overhead expenses and payroll and benefits expenses  on a combined basis  equaled of our average invested assets for the year 
our adviser billed us on a monthly basis for these amounts 
our adviser was required to reimburse us annually for the amount by which amounts billed to and paid by us exceeded this limit during a given year 
the amounts never exceeded the limit and  consequently  we never received reimbursement 
during the years ended december   and  we reimbursed our adviser approximately million and million  respectively  of overhead expenses 
management services and fees under the amended advisory agreement the amended advisory agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to of our total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock  and an incentive fee based on funds from operations  or ffo 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee  ffo includes any realized capital gains and capital losses  less any dividends paid on preferred stock  but ffo does not include any unrealized capital gains or losses 
the incentive fee will reward our adviser if our quarterly ffo  before giving effect to any incentive fee pre incentive fee ffo  exceeds  or annualized  the hurdle rate of total stockholders equity  less the recorded value of any preferred stock 
our adviser will receive of the amount of the pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds the hurdle rate  but is less than of our pre incentive fee ffo 
our adviser will also receive an incentive fee of of the amount of our pre incentive fee ffo that exceeds 
the incentive fee may be reduced because of our line of credit covenant which limits distributions to our stockholders to of our funds from operations  or ffo 
for the year ended december   the base management fee  based on the amended advisory agreement was approximately million 
for the year ended december   we recorded an incentive fee of approximately million  offset by a credit from an unconditional and irrevocable voluntary waiver issued by the adviser of approximately million  for a net incentive fee for the year ended december  of approximately million 
our board of directors accepted our advisers offer to waive a portion of the incentive fee for the year ended december  in order to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders 
our adviser has indicated that it intends to continue to waive all or a portion of the incentive fee in order to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders  however  our adviser is not required to issue any waiver  in whole or in part 
administration agreement under the administration agreement  we pay separately for our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations including  but not limited to  rent for employees of our administrator  and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  controller  treasurer and their respective staffs 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million  for the administration fee 
critical accounting policies management believes our most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition including straight line rent  purchase price allocation  accounting for our investments in real estate  provision for loan losses  the accounting for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  and income taxes 
each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes this information in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  and provides guidance on recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition of tax positions 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and the adoption had no impact on our results of operations

sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements and requires registrants to consider the effect of all carry over and reversing effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying errors in current year financial statements 
sab does not change the sec s previous guidance in sab no 
 materiality  on evaluating the materiality of misstatements 
a registrant applying the new guidance for the first time that identifies material errors in existence at the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november   may correct those errors through a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
the cumulative effect alternative is available only if the application of the new guidance results in a conclusion that a material error exists as of the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november   and those misstatements were determined to be immaterial based on a proper application of the registrant s previous method for quantifying misstatements 
we adopted sab effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and the adoption had no impact on our results of operations

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas

revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r significantly changes the accounting for acquisitions involving business combinations  as it requires that the assets and liabilities of all business combinations be recorded at fair value  with limited exceptions 
sfas r also requires that all expenses related to the acquisition be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized into the cost of the acquisition as had been the previous accounting under sfas sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december  results of operations our weighted average yield on the portfolio as of december  was approximately 
the weighted average yield was calculated by taking the annualized straight line rent  reflected as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations  or mortgage interest payments  reflected as interest income from mortgage notes receivable on our consolidated statements of operations  of each acquisition or mortgage loan as a percentage of the acquisition or loan price  as applicable 
the weighted average yield does not take into account the interest expense incurred on the financings placed on our properties

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k as of december  contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations lease obligations purchase obligations total long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our line of credit  term loan and mortgage notes payble that were outstanding as of december  the line of credit matures in december and the term loan matures in december interest on long term debt obligations does not include interest on our borrowings under our line of credit or term loan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risk that we believe we will be exposed to is interest rate risk 
we currently own one variable rate loan receivable  certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions of our loans and leases to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income in and  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  if the one month libor rate had increased by in and  our interest income and rental revenue would have increased by  in both years and our interest expense on the line of credit and short term loan would have increased by  in  for a net decrease in our net income available to common stockholders of  or  in and a net increase in our net income available to common stockholders of  or  in if the one month libor had decreased by in and  our interest income and rental revenue would have decreased by  and  respectively  and our interest expense on the line of credit and short term loan would have increased by  in  for a net increase in our net income available to common stockholders of  or  in  and a net decrease in our net income available to common stockholders of  or  in there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit at the end of and the short term loan was not in place in  thus the hypothetical change in the libor rates had no impact in although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan and lease portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
as of december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit  term loan or long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
