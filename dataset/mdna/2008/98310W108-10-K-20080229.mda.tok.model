separation from cendant on july   cendant corporation or former parent distributed all of the shares of wyndham common stock to the holders of cendant common stock issued and outstanding on july   the record date for the distribution 
on august   we commenced regular way trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol wyn 
before our separation from cendant  we entered into separation  transition services and several other agreements with cendant  realogy and travelport to effect the separation and distribution  govern the relationships among the parties after the separation and allocate among the parties cendant s assets  liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation 
under the separation and distribution agreement  we assumed of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of cendant or its subsidiaries which were not primarily related to our business or the businesses of realogy  travelport or avis budget  and realogy assumed of these contingent and other corporate liabilities 
these include liabilities relating to cendant s terminated or divested businesses  the travelport sale on august   taxes of travelport for taxable periods through the date of the travelport sale  certain litigation matters  generally any actions relating to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation 
on december   realogy entered into an agreement and plan of merger with an affiliate of apollo management vi  lp apollo and  on april   realogy announced that affiliates of apollo had completed the merger 
although realogy no longer trades its common stock as an independent public company  the merger does not negate realogy s obligation to satisfy of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of cendant or its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement 
as a result of the sale  realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for 
table of contents the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
because we now conduct our business as a separate stand alone public company  our historical financial information does not reflect what our results of operations  financial position or cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand alone public company during the periods presented 
therefore  the historical financial information for such periods may not necessarily be indicative of what our results of operations  financial position or cash flows will be in the future and may not be comparable to periods ending after july  results of operations lodging we enter into agreements to franchise our lodging franchise systems to independent hotel owners 
our standard franchise agreement typically has a term of to years and provides a franchisee with certain rights to terminate the franchise agreement before the term of the agreement under certain circumstances 
the principal source of revenues from franchising hotels is ongoing franchise fees  which are comprised of royalty fees and other fees relating to marketing and reservation services 
ongoing franchise fees typically are based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchised hotel and are accrued as earned and upon becoming due from the franchisee 
an estimate of uncollectible ongoing franchise fees is charged to bad debt expense and included in operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
lodging revenue also includes initial franchise fees  which are recognized as revenue when all material services or conditions have been substantially performed  which is either when a franchised hotel opens for business or when a franchise agreement is terminated as it has been determined that the franchised hotel will not open 
our franchise agreements also require the payment of fees for certain services  including marketing and reservations 
with such fees  we provide our franchised properties with a suite of operational and administrative services  including access to i an international  centralized  brand specific reservations system  ii advertising  iii promotional and co marketing programs  iv referrals  v technology  vi training and vii volume purchasing 
we are contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation fees we collect from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements  as such  revenues earned in excess of costs incurred are accrued as a liability for future marketing or reservation costs 
costs incurred in excess of revenues are expensed 
in accordance with our franchise agreements  we include an allocation of costs required to carry out marketing and reservation activities within marketing and reservation expenses 
we also provide property management services for hotels under management contracts 
our standard management agreement typically has a term of up to years 
our management fees are comprised of base fees  which are typically calculated based upon a specified percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations  and incentive fees  which are typically calculated based upon a specified percentage of a hotel s gross operating profit 
management fee revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract 
we incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and report reimbursements received from managed properties as revenue and the costs incurred on their behalf as expenses 
management fee revenues are recorded as a component of franchise fee revenues and reimbursable revenues are recorded as a component of service fees and membership revenue on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
the costs  which principally relate to payroll costs for operational employees who work at the managed hotels  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
the reimbursements from hotel owners are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as a result  these reimbursable costs have little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenue and revenue related to payroll reimbursements was million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during the period october  date of wyndham hotels and resorts brand acquisition  which includes management contracts through december  we also earn revenue from administering the triprewards loyalty program 
when a member stays at a participating hotel  we charge our franchisee managed property owner a fee based upon a percentage of room revenue generated from such stay 
this fee is accrued as earned and upon becoming due from the franchisee 

table of contents within our lodging segment  we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics i number of rooms  which represents the number of rooms at lodging properties at the end of the year  ii weighted average rooms  which represents the weighted average number of hotel rooms available for rental for the year  iii revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of available rooms occupied for the year by the average rate charged for renting a lodging room for one day and iv royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  which are typically based on a percentage of the gross room revenues of each franchised hotel 
vacation exchange and rentals as a provider of vacation exchange services  we enter into affiliation agreements with developers of vacation ownership properties to allow owners of intervals to trade their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for some members  for other leisure related products and services 
additionally  as a marketer of vacation rental properties  generally we enter into contracts for exclusive periods of time with property owners to market the rental of such properties to rental customers 
our vacation exchange business derives a majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and exchange fees from members trading their intervals 
annual dues revenue represents the annual membership fees from members who participate in our vacation exchange business and  for additional fees  have the right to exchange their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for certain members  for other leisure related products and services 
we record revenue from annual membership dues as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize it on a straight line basis over the membership period during which delivery of publications  if applicable  and other services are provided to the members 
exchange fees are generated when members exchange their intervals for equivalent values of rights and services  which may include intervals at other properties within our vacation exchange business or other leisure related products and services 
exchange fees are recognized as revenue when the exchange requests have been confirmed to the member 
our vacation rentals business derives its revenue principally from fees  which generally range from approximately to of the gross rent charged to rental customers 
the majority of the time  we act on behalf of the owners of the rental properties to generate our fees 
we provide reservation services to the independent property owners and receive the agreed upon fee for the service provided 
we remit the gross rental fee received from the renter to the independent property owner  net of our agreed upon fee 
revenue from such fees is recognized in the period that the rental reservation is made  net of expected cancellations 
upon confirmation of the rental reservation  the rental customer and property owner generally have a direct relationship for additional services to be performed 
cancellations for  and each totaled less than of rental transactions booked 
our revenue is earned when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also earn rental fees in connection with properties we own or lease under capital leases and such fees are recognized when the rental customer s stay occurs  as this is the point at which the service is rendered 
within our vacation exchange and rentals segment  we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics i average number of vacation exchange members  which represents members in our vacation exchange programs who pay annual membership dues and are entitled  for additional fees  to exchange their intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated within our vacation exchange business and  for certain members  for other leisure related products and services  ii annual membership dues and exchange revenue per member  which represents the total annual dues and exchange fees generated for the year divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the year  iii vacation rental transactions  which represents the gross number of transactions that are generated in connection with customers booking their vacation rental stays through us and iv average net price per vacation rental  which represents the net rental price generated from renting vacation properties to customers divided by the number of rental transactions 
vacation ownership we market and sell vois to individual consumers  provide property management services at resorts and provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of vois 
our vacation ownership business derives the majority of its revenues from sales of vois and derives other revenues from consumer financing and property management 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in sfas no 
 accounting of sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for nondelivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   we must also take into 
table of contents consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing agreements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally seven to ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenue and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to operating expense in the current period on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
we also offer consumer financing as an option to customers purchasing vois  which are typically collateralized by the underlying voi 
generally  the financing terms are for seven to ten years 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is recorded at the time of the sale with a charge to the provision for loan losses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
the interest income earned from the financing arrangements is earned on the principal balance outstanding over the life of the arrangement 
we also provide day to day management services  including oversight of housekeeping services  maintenance and certain accounting and administrative services for property owners associations and clubs 
in some cases  our employees serve as officers and or directors of these associations and clubs in accordance with their by laws and associated regulations 
management fee revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract and is recorded as a component of service fees and membership on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
the costs  which principally relate to the payroll costs for management of the associations  clubs and the resort properties where we are the employer  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin and thus presentation of these reimbursable costs has little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenue and revenue related to reimbursements was million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during during  and  one of the associations that we manage paid group rci million  million and million  respectively  for exchange services 
during  and  gross sales of vois were reduced by million  million and million  respectively  of revenue that is deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  a portion of the total revenue from a vacation ownership contract sale is not recognized if the construction of the vacation resort has not yet been fully completed 
such revenue will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs for completion of construction of the vacation resort 
within our vacation ownership segment  we measure operating performance using the following key metrics i gross voi sales including tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales before deferred sales and loan loss provisions  ii tours  which represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell vois and iii volume per guest  or vpg  which represents revenue per guest and is calculated by dividing the gross voi sales  excluding tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales  by the number of tours 
other items we record lodging related marketing and reservation revenues  triprewards revenues  as well as property management services revenues for both our lodging and vacation ownership segments  in accordance with 
table of contents emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues be recorded on a gross basis 
discussed below are our consolidated and combined results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization  interest excluding interest on securitized vacation ownership debt  income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  each of which is presented on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
ebitda for periods prior to july  includes cost allocations from cendant representing our portion of general corporate overhead 
for the period january  to july  and the year ended december   cendant allocated million and million  respectively  of general corporate overhead 
cendant allocated such costs to us based on a percentage of our forecasted revenues 
general corporate expense allocations include costs related to cendant s executive management  tax  accounting  legal  treasury and cash management  certain employee benefits and real estate usage for common space 
the allocations were not necessarily indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been operating as a separate  stand alone public company for the periods presented

table of contents the increase in depreciation and amortization of million primarily resulted from technology and fixed asset investments placed into service during other income  net primarily reflects an million pre tax gain on the sale of certain vacation ownership properties and related assets during that were no longer consistent with our development plans 
interest expense increased million and interest income decreased million during primarily due to our current capital structure as a result of our separation from cendant 
our effective tax rate increased to in from in primarily due to an increase in nondeductible items and the absence of a state tax benefit recognized in we recorded an after tax charge of million during the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the adoption of sfas no 
such charge consisted of i a pre tax charge of million representing the deferral of revenue  costs associated with sales of vois that were recognized prior to january  and the recognition of certain expenses that were previously deferred and ii an associated tax benefit of million

lodging net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with primarily reflecting strong revpar gains across the majority of our brands  the success of our triprewards loyalty program and incremental property management reimbursable revenues 
such increases were partially offset in ebitda by increased expenses  particularly for marketing activities 
the increase in net revenues includes i million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business  ii an million increase in royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  which was primarily due to revpar growth of  iii million of incremental revenue generated by our triprewards loyalty program primarily due to increased member stays and iv an million increase in other revenue primarily due to fees generated upon execution of franchise contracts and ancillary services that we provide to our franchisees 
the million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business primarily relates to payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of property owners  for which we are reimbursed by the property owner 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenue is offset by the associated expense and there is no resultant impact on ebitda 
the million increase in royalty  marketing and reservation revenues was substantially driven by price increases  as well as occupancy increases  reflecting the beneficial impact of management and marketing initiatives and an increased focus on quality enhancements  including strengthening our brand standards  as well as an overall improvement in the economy and midscale lodging segments  which are the segments where we primarily compete 

table of contents ebitda further reflects i million of higher expenses primarily resulting from incremental revenues received from our franchisees  as discussed above  ii million of increased information technology costs related to developing a more robust infrastructure to support current and future global growth and iii an increase of million in other expenses primarily related to expanding our international operations and providing ancillary services to our franchisees 
the million of increased marketing spend is reflective of i incremental expenditures in our triprewards loyalty program  ii higher fees received from our franchisees where we are contractually obligated to expend these fees for marketing purposes and iii additional campaigns in international regions that we have targeted for growth 
as of december   we had approximately  properties and approximately  rooms in our system 
additionally  our hotel development pipeline included approximately hotels and approximately  rooms  of which approximately were international and approximately were new construction as of december  vacation exchange and rentals net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with the increase in net revenues primarily reflects an million increase in net revenues from rental transactions  a million increase in annual dues and exchange revenues  partially offset by an million decrease in ancillary revenues 
the increase in ebitda also includes an increase in expenses  partially offset by the absence of a million charge recorded in second quarter related to local taxes payable to certain foreign jurisdictions 
net revenue and expense increases include million and million  respectively  of currency translation from a weaker us dollar compared to other foreign currencies 
net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during driven by i a increase in rental transaction volume  ii a increase in the average net price per rental or  excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements and iii the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  which contributed an incremental million to revenues or to average net price per rental 
excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements and the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  the increase in average net price per rental was primarily a result of mix shift of rental activity to higher premium destinations 
the growth in rental transaction volume was driven by increased rentals at our landal and novasol european vacation rental businesses  which primarily resulted from i enhanced marketing programs initiated to support an expansion strategy to provide consumers with broader inventories and more destinations and ii improved local economies 
the growth in rental transactions was also the result of increased rentals in latin america due to increased marketing efforts and broader distribution channels 
such growth was partially offset by a decline in rci member rentals in europe  decreased cottage rentals in the domestic united kingdom cottage market primarily due to severe weather conditions during and a decline in cottage and apartment rentals at french destinations 
the increase in net revenues from rental transactions includes the translation effects of foreign exchange movements  which favorably impacted net rental revenues by million 
annual dues and exchange revenues increased million during as compared with primarily due to a increase in the average number of members 
annual dues and exchange revenue per member was relatively flat during as compared to as a result of favorable transaction pricing  which was offset by a decline in exchange transactions per average member 
the timing of intervals and points deposits and the mix of intervals and points to be utilized during compared with contributed to the decline in exchange transactions per average member 
in addition  we believe that trends among timeshare vacation ownership developers are i to sell multiyear products  whereby the members have access to the product every second or third year and ii to enroll members in private label clubs  whereby the members have the option to exchange within the club or through other rci channels 
such trends have a positive impact on the average number of members but an offsetting effect on the number of exchange transactions per average member 
ancillary revenues decreased due to the absence of million of consulting revenues in our asia pacific region recorded during but not repeated during and a million adjustment recorded during the second quarter of relating to previously recorded consulting revenues in our asia pacific region 
such decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenues during from various sources  which include fees from additional services provided to transacting members  club servicing revenues  fees from our credit card loyalty program and fees generated from programs with affiliates 
the increase in annual dues and exchange revenues and ancillary revenues includes the translation effects of foreign exchange movements  which favorably impacted revenues by million 
ebitda further reflects an increase in expenses of million primarily driven by i the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on expenses of million  ii a million increase in volume related expenses  which was substantially comprised of incremental costs to support growth in rental transaction volume  as 
table of contents discussed above  increased staffing costs to support member growth and increased call volumes as well as incremental investments in our information technology infrastructure  iii million of increased resort services expenses as a result of converting two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  as discussed above  iv million of incremental employee incentive program expenses during and v million of incremental severance related expenses recorded during these increases were partially offset by i the absence of a million charge recorded during the second quarter of related to local taxes payable to certain foreign jurisdictions  ii the absence of million of costs related to our separation from cendant recorded during and iii the absence of million of costs incurred during to close offices and consolidate certain call center operations 
vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with the operating results reflect growth in vacation ownership sales  consumer finance income and property management fees  as well as the impact of operational changes made during that resulted in the recognition of revenues that would have otherwise been deferred until a later date under the provisions of sfas no 
the impact of these operational changes in resulted in higher net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  that were not replicated during such growth was partially offset by incremental expenses during as compared to gross sales of vois at our vacation ownership business increased million during  driven principally by a increase in tour flow and an increase in vpg 
tour flow was positively impacted by the continued development of our in house sales programs and the opening of new sales locations 
vpg benefited from a favorable tour mix  improved efficiency in our upgrade program and higher pricing 
net revenues were impacted during by i million of incremental property management fees primarily as a result of growth in the number of units under management and ii million of increased ancillary revenues resulting from higher voi sales 
such revenue increases were partially offset by an increase of million in our provision for loan losses primarily due to higher financed voi sales during as compared to during both and  gross sales of vois were reduced by million of revenue that is deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  a portion of the total revenue from a vacation ownership contract sale is not recognized if the construction of the vacation resort has not yet been fully completed 
such revenue will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs for completion of construction of the vacation resort 
due to the strong sales pace and the timing of product construction  we anticipate an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million during this deferred revenue is expected to be realized during future periods and there is no impact to our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in addition  net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during due to net interest income of million earned on contract receivables during as compared to million during such increase was primarily due to growth in the portfolio  partially offset in ebitda by higher interest costs during we incurred interest expense of million on our securitized debt at a weighted average rate of during compared to million at a weighted average rate of during our net interest income margin decreased from during to during due to increased securitizations completed in  a basis point increase in interest rates  as described above  and approximately million of increased average borrowings on our other securitized debt facilities during as compared to our securitized debt increased by million from december  to december   while our vacation ownership contract receivables increased by million during the same periods 
we were able to securitize a higher percentage of our vacation ownership contract receivables during as compared with such improved borrowing efficiency against vacation ownership receivables shifted million of what would have been interest expense below ebitda into interest expense reflected within ebitda  which decreased our net interest income margin 
see liquidity risk for a description of the anticipated impact on our securitizations from the adverse conditions suffered by the united states asset backed securities and commercial paper markets 
ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in operating  marketing and administrative expenses  exclusive of incremental interest expense on our securitized debt and the impact of the operational changes made in in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 primarily resulting from i million of increased cost of sales primarily associated with increased voi sales  ii million of incremental marketing expenses to support sales efforts  iii million of additional commission expense associated with increased voi sales  iv million of increased costs related to the property management services  as discussed above  v million of incremental costs primarily incurred to fund additional staffing needs to support continued growth in the business and vi million of costs related to sales incentives awarded to owners

lodging net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with primarily reflecting the october acquisition of the franchise and property management businesses of the wyndham hotels and resorts brand and strong revpar gains across our legacy brands  which were partially offset by the absence of a million gain on the sale of an investment recognized in ebitda comparisons also reflect our strategic decision to intensify marketing campaigns  particularly for our wyndham brand 
the operating results of the wyndham hotels and resorts brand have been included in our results from october  forward and  therefore  were incremental to our results during the period january  through october  during this period  the wyndham hotels and resorts brand contributed incremental net revenues of million  of which million was generated from the franchise business and million was generated from the property management business 
included within the million of revenue generated from the property management business is million of revenue related to reimbursable payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of property owners 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenue is offset by the associated expense and there is little to no resultant impact on ebitda 
additionally  there was little to no ebitda contribution from the franchise business as substantially all of the fees received were utilized to execute a key strategy of promoting the wyndham brand name and driving brand bookings through enhanced marketing efforts 
the operating results of our lodging business also reflect the acquisition of the baymont inn suites brand  which was acquired in april  and contributed incremental net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions discussed above  net revenues in our lodging business increased million in such increase was primarily due to revpar growth of  partially offset by a decline in weighted average rooms available and a million gain recognized in the first quarter of on the sale of an investment no longer deemed strategic 
the revpar growth reflects increases in price and occupancy principally attributable to the beneficial impact of management initiatives implemented in prior periods  such as the strategic assignment of personnel to field locations designed to assist franchisees in improving their operating performance and an overall improvement in the economy lodging segment 
the decline in rooms reflects i our termination of underperforming properties primarily throughout that did not meet our required quality standards or their financial obligations to us and ii the expiration of franchise agreements and certain franchisees exercising their right to terminate their agreements 
as of december   our hotel development pipeline included approximately hotels and approximately  rooms  of which approximately are international and approximately are new construction 
as previously discussed  a strategic growth initiative of our lodging business is to increase brand awareness and drive brand bookings 
to this end  during  we increased our marketing spend by million  which is incremental to the marketing spend for the wyndham hotels and resorts and baymont brands 
the million of 
table of contents incremental marketing spend is reflective of i additional fees received from our franchisees where we are contractually obligated to expend these fees for marketing purposes  ii additional campaigns in international regions that we have targeted for growth and iii incremental investments in our triprewards loyalty program 
in addition  expenses also increased million as a result of our separation from cendant 
vacation exchange and rentals net revenues increased million and ebitda decreased million in compared with  primarily reflecting a million increase in net revenues from rental transactions and a million increase in annual dues and exchange revenues  more than offset in ebitda by a million increase in expenses  as discussed below 
revenue and expense increases include million and million  respectively  from a weaker us dollar compared to other foreign currencies and the related currency translation impact 
net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during driven by a increase in rental transaction volume and a increase in the average net price per rental 
the growth in rental transaction volume was primarily due to an increase of approximately  rental transactions in arrivals at our landal greenparks camping vacation site and increased booking volumes of approximately  rental transactions at our novasol brand 
the increase in net revenues from rental transactions and the average net price per rental includes the translation effects of foreign exchange movements  which favorably impacted net rental revenues by million and accounted for of the increase in the average net price per rental 
annual dues and exchange revenues increased million during as compared with due to a increase in the average number of members 
points based transactions represented of the total exchange transactions during as compared with during exchange transactions per member remained relatively constant year over year  however  there has been a shift to a greater amount of points based members and related points based transactions from the standard one week for one week exchange members and transactions in our legacy rci weeks exchange program 
this shift resulted in an increase in our overall member base and exchange transaction volume 
since points are exchangeable for various travel related products and services  as well as for vacation stays for various lengths of time  points based exchange activity will generally result in higher transaction volumes with lower average fees as compared with the rci weeks exchange program 
ancillary revenues from various sources collectively increased million during compared to ancillary revenue sources primarily included million of additional consulting fees  club servicing fees and fees from our credit card loyalty program 
such increases were offset by a million reduction in travel fee revenues primarily due to lower commission rates realized in relating to an outsourcing agreement to provide services to third party travel club members and the absence of a million recovery of local taxes paid to a foreign jurisdiction realized during the fourth quarter of ebitda further reflects an increase in expenses of million primarily driven by i a million increase in volume related expenses  which was substantially comprised of higher reservation call center staffing costs to support member growth and increased call volumes  ii a million charge in the second quarter of related to local taxes payable to certain foreign jurisdictions  iii million of incremental expenses incurred for product and geographic expansion  including increased marketing campaigns  timing of certain other marketing expenses  expansion of property recruitment efforts and investment in our consulting and international activities  iv million of higher cost of sales on rentals of vacation stay intervals  v the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on expenses of million  vi million of costs primarily related to higher corporate overhead allocations and vii million of costs related to our separation from cendant 
these increases were partially offset by i the absence of million of costs incurred in to combine the operational infrastructures of our vacation exchange and rentals business and ii million of cost savings due to efficiencies realized in vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in as compared with the operating results reflect growth in vacation ownership sales and consumer finance income  as well as the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
the impact of sfas no 
on our results for was a reduction to net revenues of million and an increase to ebitda of million 
we made operating changes during that resulted in the recognition of revenues that would have otherwise been deferred under the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  included within the impact of sfas no 
 are benefits to net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
these benefits would have otherwise been offset by deferrals had the operational changes not been made 
excluding such benefits  the

would have been a reduction to net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  during exclusive of the impact of sfas no 
 gross sales of vois at our vacation ownership business increased million in principally driven by a increase in tour flow and a increase in vpg 
tour flow was positively impacted by the continued development of our in house sales programs 
vpg benefited from a favorable tour flow mix and higher pricing 
in addition  net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in due to incremental net interest income earned on contract receivables primarily resulting from growth in the portfolio 
such growth was partially offset in ebitda by higher interest costs in during  we paid interest expense on our securitized debt of million at a weighted average rate of compared to million at a weighted average rate of in revenue and ebitda comparisons were also negatively impacted by the absence of million of income recorded in the second quarter of in connection with the disposal of a parcel of land that was no longer consistent with our development plans

the irs has opened an examination for cendant s taxable years through during which we were included in cendant s tax returns 
although we and cendant believe there is appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns  we have recorded liabilities representing the best estimates of the probable loss on certain positions 
we believe that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
although we believe the recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore  our and cendant s assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting the assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any other related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result

since certain monoline insurers may not be positioned to write new policies  there is a substantial likelihood that the cost of such insurance may increase or that the insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain due to i decreased competition in that business  including a reduced number of monolines that may issue new policies due to either a loss of aaa aaa ratings from the rating agencies or b lack of confidence of 
table of contents market participants in the value of such insurance and ii the increased spreads paid to subordinate bond investors 
it is still possible to issue asset backed securities without insurance 
our last issuance without insurance was in during the third and fourth quarters of  the asset backed securities market and commercial paper markets in the united states suffered adverse conditions and consequently  our cost of securitized borrowings increased due to i increased spreads over relevant benchmarks and ii increased monoline insurance costs 
we expect to access the term securitization market and renew our asset backed conduit which is supported by commercial paper in to the extent that the recent increases in funding costs in the securitization and commercial paper markets persist  it will negatively impact the cost of such borrowings 
a long term disruption to the asset backed or commercial paper markets could jeopardize our ability to obtain such financings 
while benchmark rates such as libor and us treasuries have declined in recent months  there can be no assurance that such declines will persist  or that credit spreads over those benchmarks will not widen 
our liquidity position may also be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the markets in which we operate 
our liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership financings could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew any of the facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios  which may occur in certain instances if the credit quality of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorates 
our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities 
as a result of the sale of realogy on april   realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb and baa by standard poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
during august  standard poor s assigned a negative outlook to our senior unsecured debt 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our franchise and management fees  commission income earned from renting vacation properties  annual subscription fees or annual membership dues  as applicable  and exchange transaction fees and sales of vois 
revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters  because of increased leisure travel during the summer months 
revenues from rental income earned from booking vacation rentals are generally highest in the third quarter  when vacation rentals are highest 
revenues from vacation exchange transaction fees are generally highest in the first quarter  which is generally when members of our vacation exchange business plan and book their vacations for the year 
revenues from sales of vois are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in other quarters 
the seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as we expand into new markets and geographical locations  we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past 
separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries transfer of cendant corporate liabilities and issuance of guarantees to cendant and affiliates pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  upon the distribution of our common stock to cendant shareholders  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to the assumption of certain liabilities and the obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for of these cendant liabilities 
the amount of liabilities which we assumed in connection with our separation from cendant approximated million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were comprised of certain cendant corporate liabilities which were recorded on the books of cendant as well as 
table of contents additional liabilities which were established for guarantees issued at the date of separation related to certain unresolved contingent matters and certain others that could arise during the guarantee period 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provided a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant  realogy and travelport 
these arrangements  which are discussed in more detail below  have been valued upon our separation from cendant with the assistance of third party experts in accordance with financial interpretation no

accounting for contingencies liability assumed at the date of separation of which million of the million pertain to litigation liabilities 
in connection with these liabilities  million are recorded in current due to former parent and subsidiaries and million are recorded in long term due to former parent and subsidiaries at december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we are indemnifying cendant for these contingent liabilities and therefore any payments would be made to the third party through the former parent 
the million relating to the fin guarantees is recorded in other current liabilities at december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we have a million receivable primarily due from former parent relating to income tax refunds  which is recorded in current due from former parent and subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet 
such receivable totaled million at december   related to a refund of excess funding paid to our former parent resulting from the separation and income tax refunds 
at december   we had recorded a million receivable in non current due from former parent and subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet  which represented our right  pursuant to the separation agreement  to receive of any proceeds from the ultimate sale of cendant s preferred stock investment in and warrants of affinion group holdings  inc affinion 
on january   affinion redeemed a portion of the preferred stock investment owned by avis budget group  of which we owned a interest pursuant to the separation agreement 
upon our receipt of our share of the proceeds resulting from affinion s redemption  such receivable was reduced to million 
the receivable was reclassified to other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of march  as the investment had been legally transferred to us from avis budget group 
accordingly  as of december   we own million of preferred stock investment and warrants in affinion and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
following is a discussion of the liabilities on which we issued guarantees contingent litigation liabilities we have assumed of liabilities for certain litigation relating to  arising out of or resulting from certain lawsuits in which cendant is named as the defendant 
the indemnification obligation will continue until the underlying lawsuits are resolved 
we will indemnify cendant to the extent that cendant is required to make payments related to any of the underlying lawsuits 
as the guarantee relates to matters in various stages of litigation  the maximum exposure cannot be quantified 
due to the inherent nature of the litigation process  the timing of payments related to these liabilities cannot be reasonably predicted  but is expected to occur over several years 
during  cendant settled a number of these lawsuits and we assumed a portion of the related indemnification obligations 
as discussed above  for each settlement  we paid of the aggregate settlement amount to cendant 
our payment obligations under the settlements were greater or less than our accruals  depending on the matter 
during  cendant received an adverse order in a litigation matter for which we retain a indemnification obligation 
as a result  we increased our contingent litigation accrual for this matter by million 
as a result of these settlements and payments to cendant  as well as other reductions and accruals for developments in active litigation matters  our aggregate accrual for outstanding cendant contingent litigation liabilities was decreased from million at december  to million at december  contingent tax liabilities we are liable for of certain contingent tax liabilities and will pay to cendant the amount of taxes allocated pursuant to the tax sharing agreement for the payment of certain taxes 
this liability will remain outstanding until tax audits related to the tax year are completed or the statutes of limitations governing the tax year have passed 
our maximum exposure cannot be quantified as tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the outcome of tax audits or litigation is inherently uncertain 
additionally  the timing of payments related to these liabilities cannot be reasonably predicted  but we expect a majority to occur during 
table of contents cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities we have has assumed of corporate liabilities of cendant including liabilities relating to i cendant s terminated or divested businesses  ii liabilities relating to the travelport sale  if any  and iii generally any actions with respect to the separation plan or the distributions brought by any third party 
our maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified as this guarantee relates primarily to future claims that may be made against cendant  that have not yet occurred 
we assessed the probability and amount of potential liability related to this guarantee based on the extent and nature of historical experience 
guarantee related to deferred compensation arrangements in the event that cendant  realogy and or travelport are not able to meet certain deferred compensation obligations under specified plans for certain current and former officers and directors because of bankruptcy or insolvency  we have guaranteed such obligations to the extent relating to amounts deferred in respect of and earlier 
this guarantee will remain outstanding until such deferred compensation balances are distributed to the respective officers and directors 
the maximum exposure cannot be quantified as the guarantee  in part  is related to the value of deferred investments as of the date of the requested distribution 
additionally  the timing of payment  if any  related to these liabilities cannot be reasonably predicted because the distribution dates are not fixed 
transactions with avis budget group  realogy and travelport prior to our separation from cendant  we entered into a transition services agreement tsa with avis budget group  realogy and travelport to provide for an orderly transition to becoming an independent company 
under the tsa  cendant agrees to provide us with various services  including services relating to human resources and employee benefits  payroll  financial systems management  treasury and cash management  accounts payable services  telecommunications services and information technology services 
in certain cases  services provided by cendant under the tsa may be provided by one of the separated companies following the date of such company s separation from cendant 
we recorded million of expenses during and million of expenses and less than million in other revenues during in the consolidated and combined statements of income related to these agreements 
separation and related costs during  we incurred costs of million in connection with executing our separation from cendant 
such costs consisted primarily of expenses related to the rebranding initiative at our vacation ownership business and certain transitional expenses 
during  we incurred costs of million in connection with executing our separation from cendant  consisting primarily of i the acceleration of vesting of certain employee incentive awards and the related equitable adjustments of such awards  ii an impairment charge due to a rebranding initiative for our fairfield and trendwest trademarks and iii consulting and payroll related services

e excludes million of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with fin since it is not reasonably estimatable to determine the periods in which such liability would be settled with the respective tax authorities 

table of contents in addition to the above and in connection with our separation from cendant  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to our assumption of certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for of these cendant liabilities 
additionally  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we are responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation

see separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries discussion for details of guaranteed liabilities 
other commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements purchase commitments 
in the normal course of business  we make various commitments to purchase goods or services from specific suppliers  including those related to vacation ownership resort development and other capital expenditures 
purchase commitments made by us as of december  aggregated million 
individually  such commitments range as high as million related to the development of a vacation ownership resort 
the majority of the commitments relate to the development of vacation ownership properties aggregating million  million of which relates to and million of which relates to 
standard guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into numerous agreements that contain standard guarantees and indemnities whereby we indemnify another party for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  many of these parties are also indemnified against any third party claim resulting from the transaction that is contemplated in the underlying agreement 
such guarantees and indemnifications are granted under various agreements  including those governing i purchases  sales or outsourcing of assets or businesses  ii leases of real estate  iii licensing of trademarks  iv development of vacation ownership properties  v access to credit facilities and use of derivatives and vi issuances of debt securities 
the guarantees and indemnifications issued are for the benefit of the i buyers in sale agreements and sellers in purchase agreements  ii landlords in lease contracts  iii franchisees in licensing agreements  iv developers in vacation ownership development agreements  v financial institutions in credit facility arrangements and derivative contracts and vi underwriters in debt security issuances 
while some of these guarantees and indemnifications extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement  many survive the expiration of the term of the agreement or extend into perpetuity unless subject to a legal statute of limitations 
there are no specific limitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees and indemnifications  nor are we able to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees and indemnifications as the triggering events are not subject to predictability 
with respect to certain of the aforementioned guarantees and indemnifications  such as indemnifications of landlords against third party claims for the use of real estate property leased by us  we maintain insurance coverage that mitigates any potential payments to be made 
other guarantees indemnifications 
in the normal course of business  our vacation ownership business provides guarantees to certain property owners associations for funds required to operate and maintain vacation ownership properties in excess of assessments collected from owners of the vacation ownership interests 
we may be required to fund such excess as a result of our unsold owned vacation ownership interests or failure by owners to pay such assessments 
these guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying subsidy agreements which generally approximate one year and are renewable on an annual basis or until a stipulated percentage typically or higher of related vacation ownership interests are sold 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was million as of december  we would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the owners assessed paid their assessments 
any assessments collected from the owners of the vacation ownership interests would reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made by us 
additionally  should we be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners assessments under these guarantees  we would be permitted access to the property for our own use and may use that property to engage in revenue producing activities  such as marketing or rental 
during  and  we made payments related to these guarantees of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we recorded a liability in connection with these guarantees of million 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we enter into hotel management agreements which may provide a guarantee by us of minimum returns to the hotel owner 
under such guarantees  we are required to compensate for any shortfall over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount 
our exposure under these guarantees is partially mitigated by our ability to terminate any such management agreement if certain targeted operating results are not met 
additionally  we are able to recapture a portion or all of the shortfall payments and any waived fees in the event that future operating results exceed targets 
the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees is million 
the underlying agreement would not require payment until or thereafter 
as of december   we recorded a liability in connection with these guarantees of less than million on our consolidated balance sheet 
securitizations 
we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities all of which are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  letters of credit 
as of december   we had million of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding  which mainly relate to support for development activity at our vacation ownership business 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated and combined results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
vacation ownership revenue recognition 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in sfas no 
 accounting of sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing arrangements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally seven to ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
prior to  our provision for loan losses was presented as expenses on the combined statements of income 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is now classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated and combined statements of income see allowance for loan losses discussed below 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenue and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are 
table of contents deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to the current period as part of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project  which may result in difference in the timing and amount of revenue recognized from the construction of vacation ownership properties 
this policy changed upon our adoption of sfas no 
and sop  which is discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in our vacation ownership segment  we provide for estimated vacation ownership contract receivable cancellations at the time of voi sales by recording a provision for loan losses on the consolidated and combined statements of income 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the historical performance of similar vacation ownership contract receivables 
we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks defaults for each year s sales over the entire life of those contract receivables 
we consider current defaults  past due aging  historical write offs of contracts  consumer credit scores fico scores in the assessment of borrower s credit strength and expected loan performance 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
if current conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on uncollectibility 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is classified as a reduction to revenue with no change made to prior periods presented 
business combinations 
a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
further  we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques including discount rates and timing of future cash flows 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates 
with regard to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations  we annually during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process or  more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred  review their carrying values as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
the aggregate carrying values of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were  million and million  respectively  as of december  and  million and million  respectively  as of december  our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among our three reportable segments 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt 
foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure as of december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest rates 
we have approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december  of that total  million was issued as variable rate debt and has not been synthetically converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
a hypothetical change in our effective weighted average interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by million 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets  liabilities or expected cash flows 
at december   the absolute notional amount of our outstanding hedging instruments is million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease of million in the fair value of the hedging instrument at december  such a change would be largely offset by an opposite effect on the underlying assets  liabilities and expected cash flows 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates
