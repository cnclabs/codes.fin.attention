item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the other information in this form k  investors should carefully consider the following discussion and the information under risk factors when evaluating us and our business 
overview we develop and commercialize innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need  have well understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first to market 
our product portfolio is comprised of three approved products and multiple investigational product candidates 
approved products include naglazyme  aldurazyme  and kuvan 
additionally  we have rights to receive royalties related to orapred and orapred odt 
naglazyme received marketing approval in the us in may and in the eu in january naglazyme net product sales for totaled million compared to million for aldurazyme has been approved for marketing in the us  us  japan and in other countries 
we have developed aldurazyme through a joint venture with genzyme 
aldurazyme net revenue recorded by our joint venture for totaled million  compared to million for effective january  we restructured our relationship with genzyme as discussed in item of this form k 
kuvan was granted marketing approval in the us in december kuvan net product sales for the approximate two week period after approval and launch in december were million 
in may  we completed the transaction to acquire the orapred product line from ascent pediatrics  a wholly owned subsidiary of medicis 
in march  we entered into an agreement with alliant pharmaceuticals  inc  which was subsequently acquired by sciele pharma inc sciele  for the continued sale and commercialization of the orapred product line 
through the sublicense agreement  sciele acquired exclusive rights to market these products in north america 
sciele is responsible for the costs of commercializing the products in north america 
in june  the fda granted marketing approval for orapred odt prednisolone sodium phosphate orally disintegrating tablets  the first orally disintegrating tablet form of prednisolone available in the united states 
we are developing several product candidates for the treatment of genetic diseases including peg pal  a preclinical enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of the more severe form of pku 
we are developing peg pal for phenylketonurics who are not bh responsive 
we are also developing bh for the treatment of other indications  including cardiovascular indications  with trials initiated in peripheral arterial disease and sickle cell disease 
key components of our results of operations for the years ended december   and  include the following total net product sales collaborative agreement revenue research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense net loss orapred acquisition related expenses stock based compensation expense 
table of contents see results of operations for discussion of the detailed components and analysis of the amounts above 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash balances related to long term debt totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
unless otherwise noted below  there have not been any recent changes to our assumptions  judgments or estimates included in our critical accounting policies 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition and related reserves  income taxes  inventory  research and development  clinical trial accruals and stock option plans have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include our investment in biomarin genzyme llc  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
we regularly review long lived assets for impairment 
the recoverability of long lived assets  other than goodwill  is measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no significant impairments were recognized for the years ended december  and we currently operate in one business segment  the biopharmaceutical development and commercialization segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our single operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
these lower levels are referred to as reporting units 
currently  we have identified only one reporting unit as per sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amount of our goodwill originated from the acquisition of the orapred business in the orapred business was eliminated as a reporting unit following the sublicense of north american rights for orapred  which was previously our only separate reporting unit 
immediately prior to the sublicense  which was considered a triggering event  we performed an impairment test at the orapred reporting unit level and determined that there was no impairment at march we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by assessing the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value as determined by available market value  a discounted cash flow model or appraisals  unless facts and circumstances warrant a review of goodwill for impairment before that time 
no triggering events occurred during that required an impairment test 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

table of contents as a result of the restructuring of our joint venture with genzyme  we have realized most of our investment in the joint venture as of december   through the distribution of cash and inventory in february we expect that our remaining ongoing investment in the joint venture will include our investment in the joint venture cash on hand to fund certain research and development activities related to aldurazyme and intellectual property management 
management believes that the ongoing investment in the joint venture will be recoverable 
the recoverability of the carrying value of buildings and leasehold improvements for our facilities will depend on the successful execution of our business initiatives and our ability to earn sufficient returns on our approved products and product candidates 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues consist of naglazyme product sales during and and orapred product sales through march  revenues from our collaborative agreement with merck serono and revenues from our orapred sublicense agreement 
naglazyme and kuvan product sales we recognize revenue from naglazyme and kuvan product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered to the customer  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
our product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in our income statement  in that taxes billed to customers are not included as a component of net product sales  as per emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
in the us  naglazyme and kuvan are generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end users  such as hospitals  which act as retailers 
in the eu  naglazyme is generally sold to our authorized european distributors and also to hospitals  which act as end users 
because of the pricing of our products  the limited number of patients and the customers limited return rights  naglazyme customers and retailers generally carry a very limited inventory 
we also sell our products to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers  which  with respect to naglazyme and kuvan  act as intermediaries between us and end users and generally do not stock quantities of naglazyme and kuvan 
accordingly  we expect that sales related to our product will be closely tied to end user demand 
we record reserves for rebates payable under medicaid and other government programs as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our reserve calculations require estimates  including estimates of sales mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period  and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
to the extent actual rebates differ from our estimates  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed 
we record allowances for product returns  if appropriate  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product returns is required  including market exclusivity of the product based on its orphan drug status  the patient population  the customers limited return rights and our joint venture s experience of returns for aldurazyme  which is a similar product to naglazyme 
based on these factors  management has concluded that naglazyme and kuvan product returns will 
table of contents be minimal 
in the future  if any of these factors and or the history of product returns changes  an allowance for product returns may be required 
as naglazyme was approved for commercial sale in the us during the second quarter of  our historical experience with rebates and returns specific to naglazyme serves as a reasonable basis for our estimates of rebates and returns for both naglazyme and kuvan 
management uses  to the extent available  current estimated sales mix of which sales will be eligible for rebates  estimated rebate rates for state medicaid programs and other government programs  as well as experience obtained through the commercialization of aldurazyme by our joint venture with genzyme  which is a similar product to naglazyme 
certain of our customers receive distributor fees based on sales volume 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products  these fees are presumed to be a reduction of the selling price of naglazyme and  therefore  are presented as a reduction of revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
we were able to leverage our experience with naglazyme to determine our estimates for kuvan  while also considering factors unique to the kuvan product 
the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable revenue dilution item that are currently applied to aggregate world wide gross sales of naglazyme and kuvan to derive net sales are described in the table below 
revenue dilution item percentage of gross sales description rebates rebates payable to state medicaid  other government programs and certain managed care providers distributor fees fees paid to authorized distributors cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total we maintain a policy to record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of naglazyme and kuvan customers to make required payments 
as of december   we had not experienced any bad debts and had no allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that allowances will not be required in the future 
if we begin to experience credit losses  our operating expenses would increase 
orapred product sales as a result of our sublicense of north american rights to a third party in march  we do not expect to record future net product sales related to the orapred product line 
future revenue streams related to the orapred product will be realized through recognition of revenue for the up front and milestone payments as well as royalty revenue for future sales of orapred products by the third party 
prior to the sublicense  we recognized revenue from orapred product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed  the product had been shipped  title and risk of loss had passed to the customer  the price to the buyer was fixed or determinable and collection from the customer was reasonably assured 
orapred product sales transactions were evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
we established and maintained reserves for amounts payable to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of a portion of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective plans 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold were recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of the original sale 
the rebate reserves were based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care organizations and state medicaid patients  as well as the rebate rates associated with eligible prescriptions 
the estimates were developed using the 
table of contents product s rebate history adjusted to reflect known and forecasted changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these factors included changes in the mix of prescriptions that were eligible for rebates  changes in the contract rebate rates and the lag time related to the processing of rebate claims by our customers and managed care organizations 
the length of time between the period of prescriptions and the processing of the related rebates was consistent historically at between three and nine months  depending on the nature of the rebate 
the length of time between the period of original sale by us and the processing of the related rebate is dependent upon both the length of time that the product is in the distribution channel and the lag time related to rebate processing by third parties 
additionally  we experienced longer than usual rebate processing lag times as a result of the transition of the product from medicis after the acquisition and high levels of orapred inventory held by wholesalers 
in the first quarter of  our liability for certain rebates was reduced due to the sublicense of north american rights for orapred to a third party 
the decrease in estimated future rebates resulted in reserve reversals and an increase in net revenue of approximately million for the year ended december  no significant adjustments were made to these reserves during to the extent actual rebates differ from our estimates  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed 
provisions for sales discounts and estimates for chargebacks and product returns were established as a reduction of product sales at the time such revenues were recognized 
these revenue reductions were established by our management as its best estimate at the time of the original sale based on the product s historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions were generally reflected either as a direct reduction to gross sales and accounts receivable through an allowance or as an addition to accrued expenses 
we generally permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned near or after expiration 
our estimates for future product returns are primarily based on the actual return history for the product and estimates of future demand related to estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
although we are unable to quantify wholesaler inventory levels of orapred with any certainty  to the extent necessary based on the expiration date and our estimates of quantity of product in the distribution channel  we adjust our estimate for future returns as appropriate 
we estimate wholesaler inventory levels  to the extent possible  based on limited information obtained from certain of our wholesale customers and through other internal analyses 
our internal analyses utilize information such as historical sales to wholesalers  product shelf life based on expiration dating  estimates of the length of time product is in the distribution channel and historical prescription data  which are provided by a third party vendor 
we also evaluate the current and future commercial market for orapred and consider factors such as orapred s performance compared to its existing competitors 
based on actual retail product demand realized during and the early settlement of product returns with a customer for an amount less than previous estimates  we adjusted our estimates of the return liabilities  which resulted in reserve reductions of approximately million  which was recorded as an increase to net revenue of approximately million and million of reduced expense for returns of product sold by the previous owner during as additional information is obtained regarding retail demand and wholesaler inventory levels  additional reserves may be required or reserves may need to be reversed 

table of contents as discussed above and prior to the sublicense of the north american rights to orapred to a third party in march  our estimates of revenue dilution items were based primarily on the historical experience for the product  as adjusted to reflect known and forecasted changes in the factors that could impact the revenue dilutions 
the nature and amount of our estimates of the applicable effective rates for revenue dilution items that were applied to gross sales of orapred to derive net sales are described in the table below 
there were no additional material revenue dilution items other than those disclosed below 
the orapred product had not experienced significant credit losses 
revenue dilution item estimated rate description sales returns provision for returns of product sales  mostly due to product expiration rebates rebates offered to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues from merck serono include both license revenue and contract research revenue 
nonrefundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement through research and development collaboration are initially deferred and recognized as license revenue over the estimated period for which we continue to have a performance obligation 
license revenue for includes the portion of the million up front license fee received from merck serono recognized as revenue during the development period and the million milestone payment related to the emea acceptance of the kuvan filing 
milestone payments related to our collaborative agreements are recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved and we have no further performance obligations related to that payment 
our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation are based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangement  the level of effort required for us to fulfill our obligation and the anticipated timing of the fulfillment of our obligation 
accordingly  we have deferred the up front license fee received from merck serono and recognized it as revenue on a straight line basis over approximately years  which represented our initial estimate of the time from inception of the agreement until european regulatory approval of kuvan for the treatment of pku  at which point our performance obligations to merck serono for developing kuvan for the treatment of pku will end 
the estimate was revised in july from approximately years to approximately years  based on updated information regarding the estimated timing of european regulatory approval 
the change in estimate reduced revenues during by approximately million  and the change in estimate reduced license revenues in by million  and is expected to increase license revenues in by approximately million 
our estimate of the kuvan commercialization period is based on several underlying assumptions about uncertain events  including actions by european regulatory authorities 
as kuvan advances through the european regulatory process  our estimates of our performance obligation period may change 
further changes in our estimates of our performance obligation period will be recognized prospectively over the remaining estimated performance obligation period 
we regularly review our estimates of the period over which we have an ongoing performance obligation 
there is no cost of sales associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from merck serono 
nonrefundable reimbursements received for shared development costs are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
contract research revenue included in collaborative agreement revenues represented merck serono s share of kuvan development costs under the agreement  which are recorded as research and development expenses 

table of contents royalty and license revenues we recognize royalty revenue and royalty receivables in the periods these royalties are earned  in advance of collection 
royalty revenue and receivables are based upon communication with the sublicensee 
the timing of customer purchases and the resulting product shipments have a significant impact on the amount of royalty revenue that we recognize in a particular period 
the majority of orapred sales are made to wholesalers  which  in turn  resell the product to retail outlets 
inventory in the distribution channel consists of inventory held by wholesalers  who are the principal customers for orapred  and inventory held by retailers 
royalty revenues from orapred sales in a particular period will be impacted by increases or decreases in wholesaler inventory levels 
if wholesaler inventories continue to substantially exceed the retail demand  we could experience reduced royalty revenue in subsequent periods 
we deferred the up front license fee of million received from a third party for the north american orapred rights  and recognized it as revenue on a straight line basis over a period of approximately months  which represented the estimated time from inception of the agreement until commercial launch of orapred odt  at which point our performance obligations ended 
our estimate of the orapred odt commercial launch period was based on several underlying assumptions about uncertain events  including actions by us regulatory authorities and successful commercialization efforts by the third party 
there are no cost of sales associated with the royalties and license revenues recorded during the period and we do not expect to incur related cost of sales in future periods 
the commercial launch of orapred odt by our sublicensee occurred in august milestone payments are recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to that payment 
as a result of the fda approval for the marketing application for orapred odt in june  we received a milestone payment of million  which has been recorded as revenue during the period 
as a result of the commercial launch of orapred odt  we also recognized million in milestone revenue during the third quarter of we also received a milestone payment of million in june for the one year anniversary of fda approval of orapred odt 
although the receipt of the million payment was based solely on the passage of time from fda approval  the company did not recognize the payment during the twelve month period following approval because the fee was not considered to be fixed or determinable until the due and payable date 
in making this determination  management considered the extended one year payment term and the related uncertain future product sales and the company s lack of experience with sciele 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to costs of sales 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical estimate in this determination is the estimate of the future expected inventory requirements  whereby we compare our internal sales forecasts to inventory on hand 
actual results may differ from those estimates and additional inventory write offs may be required 
regulatory approval for naglazyme was received in may and regulatory approval for kuvan was received in december  and costs related to the manufacturing of those products prior to this date were expensed as research and development expenses 
we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain  and product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained  as such  the related manufacturing costs for naglazyme and kuvan  prior to regulatory approval  were not capitalized as inventory 
when regulatory approval was obtained in may for naglazyme and in december for kuvan  we began capitalizing inventory at the lower of cost or fair value for the respective products 
stock based compensation of and million was capitalized into naglazyme and kuvan inventory for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses include expenses associated with contract research and development provided by third parties  product manufacturing prior to regulatory approval  clinical and regulatory costs  and internal research and development costs 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for research and development activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed unless there is an alternative future use of the funds in other research and development projects 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
a critical accounting assumption by our management is that we believe that regulatory approval of our product candidates is uncertain  and do not assume that product manufactured prior to regulatory approval will be sold commercially 
as a result  inventory costs for product candidates are expensed as research and development expenses until regulatory approval is obtained  at which time inventory is capitalized at the lower of cost or fair value 
historically  there have been no changes to this assumption 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
all estimates may differ significantly from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may occur several months after the related services were performed 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 
stock option plans we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
our expected volatility is based upon proportionate weightings of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of traded options on our stock 
the expected life of options is based on contractual life and observed historical exercise patterns  which can vary over time 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
this critical accounting assumption has been historically accurate  as we have not been able to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
however  as our revenues increase and approaches profitability  this assumption may change in the near future as the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets becomes more certain 
recent accounting pronouncements see note r of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations all of the activities related to the manufacture  distribution and sale of aldurazyme are reported in the results of the joint venture 
because of this presentation and the significance of the joint venture s operations compared to our total operations  we have divided our discussion of the results of operations into two sections  biomarin in total and biomarin genzyme llc 
the discussion of the joint venture s operations includes the total amounts for the joint venture  not just our interest in the operations 
biomarin results of operations net loss our net loss for the year ended december  decreased by million  to million  from million for the year ended december  net loss for decreased primarily as a result of the following in millions net loss for the period ended december  increased naglazyme gross profit milestone revenue related to the kuvan emea filing decreased other collaborative agreement revenues increased profits from biomarin genzyme llc decreased net orapred profits  including license revenues increased research and development expense increased selling  general and administrative expense increased interest income absence of debt conversion expense increase in corporate overhead and other net loss for the period ended december  
table of contents the increase in naglazyme gross profit during as compared to is primarily the result of additional patients initiating naglazyme therapy in the us  us and other countries 
the decrease in collaborative agreement revenues primarily relates to lower reimbursable kuvan spend 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to the continued international expansion of our naglazyme commercialization and preparation for commercializing kuvan 
the decrease in orapred profits primarily relates to the timing of the milestone payments under the orapred sublicense 
see below for additional information related to the primary net loss fluctuations presented above  including details of our operating expense fluctuations 
our net loss for the year ended december  decreased by million  to million  from million for the year ended december  net loss for decreased primarily as a result of the following in millions net loss for the period ended december  increased naglazyme gross profit increased collaborative agreement revenues milestone and license revenue related to sublicense of orapred franchise increased profits from biomarin genzyme llc decreased orapred net operating expenses increased selling  general and administrative expense increased research and development expense stock based compensation expense upon adoption of fas r increased interest expense increased interest income increase in corporate overhead and other net loss for the period ended december  the increase in naglazyme gross profit during as compared to is primarily the result of increased naglazyme sales  primarily in the us and us we also recorded million in milestone and license revenue from the sublicense of north american rights of orapred to a third party 
the decrease in naglazyme development costs is primarily due to decreased clinical trial and manufacturing expenses  after marketing approval was received in the us in may and us in january see below for additional information related to the primary net loss fluctuations presented above 
net product sales and gross profit net product sales increased million to million in from million in net product sales in primarily included million of net product sales of naglazyme and million of net product sales of kuvan 
net product sales in of million included million of net product sales of naglazyme and million of net product sales of orapred 
we expect net product sales of naglazyme and kuvan to increase in future periods  primarily due to additional patients initiating therapy 
we received marketing approval for naglazyme in the us in may and began shipping product in june in january  we received marketing approval for naglazyme in the eu net product sales for naglazyme in were million  of which million was from customers based outside of the us the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on naglazyme sales from customers based outside of the us was approximately million in gross profit from naglazyme in was approximately million  representing gross margins of approximately as compared to million in  representing gross margins of approximately 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  we began capitalizing naglazyme inventory production costs after us regulatory approval was obtained in may as a result  
table of contents some of the product sold in had an insignificant cost basis and therefore lower cost of goods sold was reported 
net product sales of naglazyme during were million 
as all of the product sold in had a zero cost basis  gross profit in was also million  as it was manufactured prior to regulatory approval 
similarly  a significant amount of kuvan inventory that will be sold in was manufactured as part of the development cycle for kuvan and was previously expensed  and therefore will have either zero or nominal cost of goods sold 
substantially all of the naglazyme inventory with an insignificant cost basis has been sold or used in clinical trials as of december  during the year ended december  we recognized net product sales of million related to the orapred product line  as compared to million for the year ended december  in march  we sublicensed rights to sell and distribute orapred in north america for up front and milestone payments of million and royalties on future sales of all orapred products  including orapred odt 
as a result of the sublicense  we do not expect to record future net product sales related to the orapred product line 
current and future revenue streams related to the orapred product will include license and royalty revenues for future sales of orapred product by the sublicensee  which are discussed below 
collaborative agreement revenues collaborative agreement revenues include both license revenue and contract research revenue under our agreement with merck serono  which was executed in may license revenues are related to amortization of the million up front license payment received from merck serono and contract research revenues are related to shared development costs that are incurred by us  of which approximately is reimbursed by merck serono 
as development spending on kuvan and r bh for other indications increases or decreases  contract research revenues may also change proportionately following the completion of phase clinical trials for each indication 
the related costs are included in research and development expenses 
collaborative agreement revenues in and were million and million  respectively  and includes the amortization of million and million  respectively  of the up front license fee received from merck serono and recognized as revenue during the period  and million and million  respectively  of reimbursable kuvan development costs incurred during the period 
collaborative agreement revenues in also include the million milestone payment received from merck serono upon emea acceptance of the kuvan filing that was recognized as revenue during the period 
collaborative agreement revenues in and were million and million  respectively  and includes the amortization of million and million  respectively  of the up front license fee received from merck serono and recognized as revenue during the period  and million and million  respectively  of reimbursable kuvan development costs incurred during the period 
royalty and license revenues royalty and license revenues  totaling million in  include a million milestone payment related to the one year anniversary of fda approval of the marketing application for orapred odt 
royalty and license revenues  totaling million in  include a million milestone payment related to fda approval of the marketing application for orapred odt  received in june and a million milestone payment related to the commercial launch of orapred odt  received in september royalty and license revenues in also include million related to the up front license fee received from the third party 
during  we recognized million in royalty revenues from orapred product sold by the sublicensee  as compared to million during there were no royalty and license revenues during

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets includes the current amortization expense of the intangible assets acquired in the ascent pediatrics transaction in may  including the orapred developed and core technology 
the acquired intangible assets are being amortized over approximately years and the amortization expense for was million  compared to million for the increase in amortization expense is due to the change in expected useful life as the amortization period was revised from years to years following the sublicense of north american rights to orapred in march following our expected purchase of the common stock of ascent pediatrics from medicis in august  the underlying intellectual property will be transferred to sciele

biomarin genzyme llc results of operations the discussion below gives effect to the inventory capitalization policy that we use for inventory held by the joint venture  which is different from the joint venture s inventory capitalization policy 
we began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in may  after us regulatory approval was obtained 
the joint venture began capitalizing aldurazyme inventory production costs in january  when inventory production for commercial sale began 
the difference in inventory capitalization policies results in a greater operating expense realized by us prior to regulatory approval  and lower cost of goods sold with higher gross profit realized by us post regulatory approval as the previously expensed product is sold by the joint venture  as well as lower research and development expense when aldurazyme is used in on going clinical trials 
these differences will be eliminated when all of the product manufactured prior to regulatory approval has been sold or has been used in clinical trials 
substantially all of the differences have been eliminated as of december  effective january   the company restructured its relationship with its joint venture partner  genzyme  regarding the manufacturing  marketing and sale of aldurazyme 
revenue and gross profit the joint venture received marketing approval for aldurazyme in the us in april and in the us in june we have subsequently received marketing approval in other countries 
aldurazyme was launched commercially in may in the us and in june in the us the joint venture recognized million of net revenue for  compared to million for the increase in net revenue of million is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of patients receiving therapy 
we expect net revenue of aldurazyme to increase in future periods  primarily due to additional patients initiating therapy 
gross profit was million for  as compared to million for  representing an increase of million 
gross margins for were approximately  as compared to gross margins for of

pursuant to our settlement of a dispute with medicis in january  medicis made available to us a convertible note of up to million beginning july  based on certain terms and conditions and provided that the company does not experience a change of control 
money advanced under the convertible note is convertible into our common stock  at medicis option  according to the terms of the convertible note 
as of december   we have not made any draws on the note 
we do not anticipate that we will draw funds from this note 
we have historically financed our operations primarily by the issuance of common stock  convertible debt and by relying on equipment and other commercial financing 
during  and for the foreseeable future  we will be highly dependent on our net product revenue to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations 
we may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing 

table of contents funding commitments we expect to fund our operations with our net product revenues from naglazyme  aldurazyme and kuvan  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments supplemented by proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners  to the extent necessary 
we expect our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will meet our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on our current long term business plans and assuming that we are able to achieve our long term goals 
this expectation could also change depending on how much we elect to spend on our development programs and for potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies 
our investment in our product development programs has a major impact on our operating performance 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and and for the period since inception march for the portion not allocated to any major program represent the following in millions since program inception naglazyme kuvan r bh for other indications  including endothelial dysfunction peg pal not allocated to specific major current projects we cannot estimate the cost to complete any of our product development programs 
additionally  except as disclosed under overview above  we cannot estimate the time to complete any of our product development programs or when we expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our product development programs 
please see risk factors in this form k  for a discussion of the reasons that we are unable to estimate such information  and in particular the following risk factors included in our form k if we fail to maintain regulatory approval to commercially market or sell our drugs  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased  to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain  if we are unable to successfully develop manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program  if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected  and if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we may elect to increase our spending above our current long term plans and may be unable to achieve our long term goals 
this could increase our capital requirements  including costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials and the manufacturing of naglazyme  aldurazyme and kuvan  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  general corporate purposes  payment of the amounts due with respect to the ascent pediatrics transaction  and working capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   our investment portfolio does not include any investments with significant exposure to the subprime mortgage market issues 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point decrease in interest rates could result in a potential loss in fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately million 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio 
however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations unless the investments are sold 

table of contents the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments total of cash and cash equivalents invested in money market funds  in commercial paper  in repurchase agreements and of uninvested cash 
of short term investments invested in us agency securities  in corporate securities and in commercial paper 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt  which carries a fixed interest rate and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our convertible debt 
the carrying value of our convertible debt approximates its fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate market risk a significant portion of aldurazyme sales by biomarin genzyme llc are earned outside of the us and  therefore  our equity in the income of biomarin genzyme llc  and in the future our royalty on aldurazyme sales  is subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations  primarily to the euro and british pound 
the policies and procedures related to the management of foreign currency risk of aldurazyme sales are maintained and performed by our joint venture partner  genzyme  which includes foreign currency forward contracts 
a significant portion of naglazyme sales are earned outside of the us and our related revenues and account receivables are subject to risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
these risks may be managed with selective use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks because we conduct business in diverse markets around the world 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which have a maturity of less than one year 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges and  accordingly  unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are reported in current earnings 
at december   we had net outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to sell million  comprised of sell contracts of million of equivalent euros and million of equivalent british pounds and buy contracts of million of equivalent euros  all of which have a term of less than months 
as of december   the weighted average settlement rate for our euro and british pound denominated contracts was and  respectively 
none of our forward exchange contracts are designated as hedges under sfas no 
as a result  the fair value changes of all contracts are reported in earnings as foreign exchange gain or loss 
for the year ended december   approximately million of loss has been included in our statement of consolidated earnings with respect to these forward exchange contracts  as compared to loss of million for the year ended december  the notional settlement value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was million at december  at december   we had cash of approximately million denominated in foreign country currencies  which represented approximately of the total investment portfolio 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to limited amounts of foreign exchange risk 
based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   we expect that a near term depreciation of the us dollar could result in the potential loss of the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets and investments by approximately million 
we expect to enter into new transactions based in foreign currencies that could be impacted by changes in exchange rates
