the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits for digital media applications  such as digital television  liquid crystal display  or lcd  television and digital set top boxes 
our soc semiconductors provide the intelligence for these new types of displays by processing and optimizing video and computer graphic signals to produce high quality and realistic images 
many of the world s leading manufacturers of consumer electronics and computer display products utilize our technology to enhance image quality and ease of use of their products 
our goal is to provide the best image quality enhanced digital media integrated circuits at competitive prices to our customers 
we sell our products primarily to digital television oems in japan  south korea  europe and asia pacific  either directly or through their supplier channel 
we consider these oems to be our customers 
historically  significant portions of our revenue have been generated by sales to a relatively small number of customers 
for the fiscal year ended june   our top three customers accounted for  of our total revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales to three end customers  samsung  midoriya a distributor supplying sony and philips  each accounted for more than of total revenues 
in philips case  sales are principally made to three contract manufacturers that supply philips 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
our products are manufactured primarily by united microelectronics corporation  or umc  a semiconductor manufacturer located in taiwan 
since june  we have focused our business primarily in a growing dptv market and related areas 
we conduct this business primarily through our cayman islands subsidiary  trident microsystems far east ltd  or tmfe 
research and development services relating to existing projects and certain new projects is conducted by both trident microsystems  inc and our subsidiaries  trident multimedia technologies shanghai co 
ltd  or tmt  and trident microsystems beijing co  ltd  or trident beijing 
in march  we acquired a privately held company known as beijing tiside electronics design co  ltd  or tiside  which was renamed as trident beijing see note business combinations  notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
operations and field application engineering support and certain sales activities are conducted through our taiwanese subsidiary  trident microelectronics co 
ltd  or tml  and other affiliates 
trident multimedia systems  inc  or tms  which was inactive at june   and tti  which was owned by trident at june   are in the process of being dissolved

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and pricing adjustments  stock based 
table of contents compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  investments  inventories  product warranty  income taxes  litigation and other loss contingencies  and accrued expenses 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  also see risk factors in item a 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings and sales returns allowance in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
our customer incentive offerings primarily involve volume rebates for our products in various target markets 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
a sales returns allowance is established based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing protection and or rights of return 
product revenues on sales made to distributors under terms that include such rights of return and price protection are deferred and only recognized when these rights expire or upon sale and shipment to the end user customers 
contract revenues related to research and development services are recognized as the related services are performed in accordance with the performance requirements of such contracts 
prior to the acquisition of trident beijing  we did not have contract revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recognized approximately  of contract revenues 
allowance for sales returns and pricing adjustments we maintain a sales returns allowance for estimated product returns based primarily on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors at that time 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates  we may determine that additional sales returns allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which we previously followed in accounting for stock based awards 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to provide guidance on sfas r 
we have applied sab in its adoption of sfas r 
our financial statements for the fiscal years ended june  and reflect the impact of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june    and included compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of june   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and compensation expense for the stock based payment awards granted subsequent to june  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to use the straight line method to expense the value of 
table of contents stock based compensation attributable to all stock options and awards other than the performance based restricted stock award with market conditions that was granted to our chief executive officer under the plan 
for purposes of expensing this single performance based grant  we elected to use the accelerated method 
upon adoption of sfas r  we elected to value our stock based payment awards granted beginning in fiscal year using the black scholes model  except for the performance based restricted stock award with market conditions granted under the plan during the second quarter of fiscal year  for which we elected to use a monte carlo valuation methodology to value the award 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
trident s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise and post vesting cancellations of options by employees 
upon the adoption of sfas r  we continued to use historical volatility in deriving our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas r and sab because we believe that future volatility over the expected term of the stock options is not likely to materially differ from the past 
prior to july   we used our historical stock price volatility in accordance with sfas for purposes of our pro forma information 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  stock based compensation expense  before income taxes  was million  million  and million  respectively  which consisted primarily of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and awards recognized under sfas r 
before our acquisition of the minority interest in our tti subsidiary  that was completed in the fiscal year ended june   we estimated the fair value of non public common stock in tti  which was then majority owned by us 
we relied in part on valuations implied from fairness opinions received in connection with tti related transactions  investment banking valuations at different points in time  the prices of occasional third party transactions in tti stock and interpolations between these data points to estimate fair value of the non public common stock at the date of grant of any options in these securities to employees 
we made these interpolations and estimates in good faith  recognizing that establishing a fair value is difficult and requires an appropriate degree of judgment and experience in the absence of an independent liquid market to establish fair value in any given security 
the fairness opinions and third party valuations in part relied upon valuation metrics of comparable publicly traded securities in taiwan 
these metrics change constantly and reflect the relative high volatility of these securities 
in general  management believes that there is also a high correlation between the value of tti common stock and the us market based characteristics  such as volatility of the trident common stock 
this correlation was also factored into the valuation of tti stock for the purposes of measuring compensation expense 
as these characteristics and factors can vary over time  we used an average over a period of time to minimize potential distortion of the measurement at any one point in time 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
none of the companies that we have acquired have had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price has been typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
as a result of our business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
when conditions are different from management s estimates at the time of an acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 

table of contents investments for investments in privately held companies and available for sale securities  on a quarterly basis we monitor the investments for impairment based on the investees most recent financial statements  which may not have been audited and may not have been timely provided to us 
we record an investment impairment charge  which is other than temporary in nature  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities and fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments might result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge on those investments 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product over a six month period 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be impacted significantly by events out of our control including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on his change over plan 
product warranty our products are generally subject to warranty  which provides for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon recognition of revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
the warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use a historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
income taxes we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  and related guidance on july  under fin  we are required to make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  income  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may increase or decrease our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we also have to assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if realization is not likely  we are required to increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate we will not ultimately realize 
we believe that we will not ultimately realize a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would decrease in the period in which we determined that the realization is probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not 
table of contents that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
because we are required to determine the probability of various possible outcomes  such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this re evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  and changes in tax law 
a change in recognition or measurement would result either in the recognition of a tax benefit or in an additional charge to the tax provision for the period 
litigation and other loss contingencies we account for litigation and other loss contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual losses from loss contingencies are significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be materially affected 
we have been required to make such adjustments to these types of estimates in the past 
accrued expenses we account for accrued expenses when incurred 
during april  as a result of an internal review we conducted  we determined that our use of certain third party software in prior periods exceeded the levels of usage authorized under license agreements in effect for such periods 
we have negotiated and intend to continue negotiating new license agreements in order to obtain the rights and authorization necessary to meet our current software usage requirements 
we believe that it is probable that the licensors of this software will  as part of these negotiations  seek compensation from us relating to this prior usage 
while we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these negotiations  we recorded as an accrual our best estimate of the amount expected to be paid 
see contingencies  prior software usage  below 
results of operations financial data for fiscal years ended june   and net revenues fiscal years net revenues by region change change dollars in thousands japan south korea europe asia pacific americas total net revenues net revenues by region are classified based on the locations of the customers principal offices even though our customers revenues may be attributable to end customers that are located in a different location 
digital media product revenues represented substantially all of our total revenues in fiscal years  and our digital media products include integrated circuit chips used in digital television  liquid crystal display television  or lcd tv  and digital set top boxes 
net revenues are revenues less reductions for rebates and allowances for sales returns 

table of contents the following table shows the percentage of our revenues during the fiscal years ended june   and that was derived from customers who individually accounted for more than of revenues in that year years ended june  revenue samsung midoriya philips we had a high concentration of accounts receivable with three customers  which accounted for approximately of the total gross accounts receivable at june  as of june   samsung  midoriya a distributor supplying sony and philips accounted for   and  respectively  of total gross accounts receivable 
for revenues generated from philips  our sales are principally made to three of philips contract manufacturers

comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year digital media product revenues decreased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  total svp revenues decreased by million  while soc revenues increased by million 
our unit sales volume of digital media products increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the year over year average selling prices of these products decreased by approximately 
the decrease in digital media product revenues was primarily due to i the delayed introduction of our soc products to a korean oem  ii aggressive competition in china s dtv market  iii shorter life cycles for newer svp products compared to the older versions and iv the slower transition from our svp to soc products in the second half of fiscal year net revenues from customers in japan  south korea and europe  collectively  accounted for   and of our total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
on a country specific basis  net revenues from customers in japan  south korea  and europe accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues for fiscal year compared to   and  respectively in fiscal year during fiscal year  net revenues decreased in most regions  particularly in south korea and asia pacific  except europe 
revenues in south korea decreased primarily due to the delayed introduction of our soc products 
asia pacific revenues decreased primarily due to the decreased sales of svp products and competition from the discrete image process controller market 
however  revenues in europe  our fastest growing region  more than doubled and increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from an increase in sales of certain svp products sold to a major european oem customer 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in digital media product revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributed to the continued success of our digital media products comprising predominantly our svp family of products in the digital television markets 
our unit sales volume of digital media products increased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  however  the year over year average selling prices decreased by approximately over the same time period 
the significant increase in digital media product revenues in fiscal year was primarily attributed to the success of our digital media products in the digital television markets 
during fiscal year  the volume of digital media units sold increased by more than while the year over year average selling price declined by approximately 
revenues from customers located in asia  primarily in south korea  japan and asia pacific  in aggregate accounted for and of our total revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
revenues in fiscal year increased in all regions primarily due to continued success of our standalone image process controllers largely in the digital process television markets 
revenues from europe in fiscal year increased primarily due to the increase sales to a major oem customer in europe 

table of contents during the years ended june  and  two customers each accounted for more than of total revenues 
substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in us dollars during all reported periods 
approximately of revenues in fiscal year were generated from sales to distributors  compared to approximately of revenues in fiscal year gross margin fiscal years change change dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin cost of revenues include the cost of purchasing wafers manufactured by an independent foundry  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services  royalties  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  operation support expenses that consist primarily of personnel related expenses including payroll  stock based compensation expenses  and manufacturing costs related principally to the mass production of our products  tester equipment rental and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year gross margin is calculated as net revenues less cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues 
gross margin has continued to be impacted by our product mix and volume of product sales  including sales to high volume customers  royalties  competitive pricing programs  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and costs associated with operational support 
gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  principally as a result of i a percentage point decrease in gross margin due to the blended average selling price for our svp product line decreasing at a faster rate than our unit cost and ii a percentage point decrease in gross margin due to a product shift to a more complex technology content  such as memc  which has a higher royalty unit fee  partially offset by iii a percentage point increase in gross margin due to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets 
the net impact on gross profit of the additions to inventory reserves and sales of previously reserved products is as follow fiscal years dollars in thousands additions to inventory reserves sales of previously reserved products net increase in gross profit in fiscal year  as shown in the table above  revenues from the sale of previously reserved products were million or of total revenues 
due to the previously recorded reserves  there was no cost of revenues reflected with respect to these product sales  which in effect  provided a benefit to the current income statement to the extent of the selling price 
concurrently  we recorded additional inventory reserves for fiscal year in the amount of approximately million 
sales of previously reserved inventory largely depend on the timing of transitions to newer generations of similar products 
when we introduce new products that are designed to enhance or replace our older products  we typically provide inventory reserves on our older products based on the expected timing and volume of customer purchases of the new product 
the timing and volume of the new product introductions can be significantly affected by events out of our control  including changes in customer product introduction schedules 
accordingly  we may end up selling more of our older fully reserved product until the customer is able to execute on its changeover plan 
we believe that the gross margins of our products will continue to decline over time as we transition from discrete image process controllers to a more competitive soc environment 
we expect asp s of existing products to 
table of contents continue to decline but overall blended asp s to be relatively flat to slightly up as our product mix shifts to soc products 
our strategy is to optimize gross margins by i developing new and more advanced products that can add relative value to the selling price  ii reducing manufacturing costs by improving production yields  iii aggressively developing more cost effective products and iv negotiating with the foundry and other manufacturing partners to receive more competitive pricing 
there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis or that we can reduce manufacturing costs or improve margins 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to i a change in product mix and a higher concentration of lower gross margin products in fiscal year  ii decreased revenue and average selling price from a previous generation product that had higher gross margin  and iii higher ramp up costs associated with our new products which were introduced in fiscal year and in late fiscal year in fiscal year  as shown in the table above  revenues from the sale of previously reserved products were million or of total revenues  as compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal year due to the previously recorded reserves  there was no cost of revenues reflected with respect to these product sales  which in effect provided a benefit to the current income statement to the extent of the selling price 
at the same time  we recorded additional inventory reserves for fiscal year in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million for fiscal year research and development fiscal years change change dollars in thousands research and development as a percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including payroll expenses  stock based compensation  engineering costs related principally to the design of our new products and depreciation of property and equipment 
because the number of new designs we release to our third party foundry can fluctuate from period to period  research  development and related expenses may fluctuate significantly 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in fiscal year as we are currently planning to continue the development of our next generation dptv products as well as improvement of our existing products 
we expect to continue to improve our product quality  expand our product lines and enter into adjacent markets 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of i a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with increased employee headcount in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  ii a million increase in stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r  iii a million increase in depreciation expense due to the completion of our research and development center in shanghai  china in september  and iv a million increase in new product development expenditures 
the million increase in new product development expenditures was attributable to a million software license fee adjustment for prior software usage and an additional million representing increased engineering expenses related to the new product development 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of i a million increase in new product development expenditures  ii a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel  iii a million

selling  general and administrative fiscal years change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including stock based compensation  commissions paid to sales representatives and distributors and professional fees 
comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted principally from i an additional million stock based compensation expense primarily related to the extension of stock option exercise periods and contingent liabilities associated with vested options of certain terminated employees  ii a million increase in consulting fees primarily due to the hiring of an outside consulting firm to review our operating and sales functions during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  iii a million increase in salaries associated with increased employee headcount compared to fiscal year  partially offset by iv a million decrease in professional fees and v a million decrease in commissions paid to distributors representatives associated with decreased revenues 
the primary reason for the decrease in professional fees was attributable to the september completion of our investigation into our stock option granting practices 
the professional fees related to the cost of this investigation were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year comparison of fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to i increased professional fees of million  of which million related to the cost of the investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and the remaining million represented legal  accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with our business operations and ii increased third party sales representative commission expenses of million due to increased product sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was attributable to increases in professional fees primarily relating to the cost of our investigation into our historical stock option granting practices 
analysis of goodwill impairment we performed an annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of trident beijing  on march   as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have two reporting units and perform an evaluation for the reporting unit that carries the goodwill 
upon completion of the fiscal year annual impairment assessment  we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of our reporting unit  determined and identified in accordance with sfas  exceeded its net carrying value 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit were based on discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuation included a reporting unit cash flow discount rate of  and a terminal value growth rate of

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower net income  larger decreases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses and other liabilities  largely offset by larger decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and non cash stock based compensation expense 
for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities increased slightly  as higher net income  a reduced increase in inventories and a decrease in prepaid expense and other current assets  was largely offset by increased accounts receivable and significantly smaller increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
on our consolidated balance sheet as of june   accounts receivable decreased primarily due to sales demand decreases that also led to decreased inventories 
accounts payable decreased due to decreased manufacturing activities and inventory purchases as well as the general timing of payments 
accrued expenses significantly decreased primarily due to payment of professional fees relating to the completion of our investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting 
investing activities cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchases and sales of available for sale investments  capital expenditures  purchases of intellectual property  purchases of stock of privately held companies and the acquisition of a business 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to i million less cash paid for purchases of property and equipment due to the completion of our new research and development building in shanghai  china in september  ii a million increase in cash from the sale of available for sale investments  iii a million increase in cash proceeds from the umc capital reduction  partially offset by iv million cash paid for the acquisition of trident beijing  and v a million decrease in cash from the purchase of intellectual property and software licenses 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to cash payments totaling approximately million for constructing our new research and development building in shanghai  china  which was completed in september we also received cash proceeds of million from the sale of stock of afa technologies  inc in fiscal year financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist of cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees and excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to i a million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance  during fiscal year  of common stock to employees upon exercise of stock options following the filing of our registration statement on form s registering shares issuable under the equity incentive plan on august  and ii the absence during fiscal year of million of net cash payments 
table of contents to employees that was paid in fiscal year in connection with the amendment of options to meet the requirements of the united states internal revenue code section a section a  offset by iii a million decrease in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation in fiscal year the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to i a million decrease in cash proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees resulting from employees temporary inability to exercise vested options  ii a million decrease in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation  and iii million of net cash paid to employees in connection with the amendment of options to meet the requirements of section a 
liquidity our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which result from the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in asia and the global economy 
although the majority of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is held outside the united states  and  therefore  might be subjected to the factors described above  we believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
we will consider transactions to finance our activities  including debt and equity offerings and new credit facilities or other financing transactions  as needed in the future 
we believe our current reserves are adequate 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than year years years years total dollars in millions contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in north america as well as various locations in japan  hong kong  china and taiwan 
operating leases include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases as of june  purchase obligations primarily represent unconditional purchase order commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for wafers and software licensing 
as of june   long term income tax payable under fin was million 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
accordingly  we have excluded this obligation from the schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june  presented above 
contingencies shareholder derivative litigation trident has been named as a nominal defendant in several purported shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the granting of stock options 
the federal court cases have been consolidated as in re trident microsystems inc derivative litigation  master file no 
c jf 
a case also has been filed in state court  limke v 
lin et al  no 
cv plaintiffs in all cases allege that certain of our current or former officers and directors caused us to grant options at less than fair market value  contrary to our public statements including our financial statements  and that as a result those officers and directors are liable to us 
no particular amount of damages has 
table of contents been alleged  and by the nature of the lawsuit no damages will be alleged against us 
the board of directors appointed the slc  composed solely of independent directors  to review and manage any claims that we may have relating to the stock option grant practices investigated by the special committee 
the scope of the slc s authority includes the claims asserted in the derivative actions 
in federal court  trident has moved to stay the case pending the assessment by the slc that was formed to consider nominal plaintiffs claims 
in state court  trident moved to stay the case in deference to the federal lawsuit  and the parties have agreed  with the court s approval  to take that motion off of the court s calendar to await the assessment of the slc 
we cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by or expense to trident 
we expect to continue to incur legal fees in responding to these lawsuits  including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations 
regulatory actions the doj is currently conducting an investigation of us in connection with our investigation into our stock option grant practices and related issues  and we are subject to a subpoena from the doj 
we are also subject to a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission on the same issues 
we have been cooperating with  and continue to cooperate with  inquiries from the sec and doj investigations 
in addition  we have received an inquiry from the internal revenue service to which we have responded 
we are unable to predict what consequences  if any  that any investigation by any regulatory agency may have on it 
any regulatory investigation could result in our business being adversely impacted 
if a regulatory agency were to commence civil or criminal action against us  it is possible that we could be required to pay significant penalties and or fines and could become subject to administrative or court orders  and could result in civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our former officers  directors and or employees and might result in such sanctions against us and or our current officers  directors and or employees 
any regulatory action could result in the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions 
if we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the sec and doj investigations  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us 
the period of time necessary to resolve the investigation by the doj and the investigation from the sec is uncertain  and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
in addition  our k plan and its administration were audited by the department of labor but no further action was noted 
special litigation committee as discussed in the section modification of certain options of note  employee stock plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements  on september   the slc extended  until march   the period during which five former employees  including our former ceo  and two former non employee directors  could exercise certain of their vested options 
after we became current in the filing of our periodic reports with the sec and filed a registration statement on form s covering shares issuable under our equity incentive plan  these five individuals requested to exercise certain of their vested options 
however  the slc initially decided that it was in the best interests of our stockholders not to allow these five individuals to exercise their vested options during the pendency of the slc s proceedings 
during the three month period ended december   the slc allowed one former employee to exercise all of his fully vested stock options and another former employee agreed to cancel all of such individual s fully vested stock options 
on january   the slc extended  until august   the period during which the two former non employee directors could exercise their unexpired vested options 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded aggregate incremental stock based compensation expense totaling approximately million related to the modifications of option exercise rights of these five former employees 
on march   the slc entered into an agreement with our former ceo allowing him to exercise all of his fully vested stock options 
under this agreement  he agreed that any shares obtained through these exercises or net proceeds obtained through the sale of such shares would be placed in an identified securities brokerage account and not withdrawn  transferred or otherwise removed without either i a court order granting him permission to do so or ii our written permission 
on may   the slc permitted one of our former non employee directors to exercise his fully vested stock options without seeking the authorization of the slc and entered into an agreement 
table of contents with the other former non employee director on terms similar to the agreement entered into with our former ceo  allowing him to exercise all of his fully vested stock options without seeking the authorization from the slc 
because trident s stock price during the fiscal year was lower than the prices at which our former ceo and each of the two former directors had desired to exercise their options  as indicated in previous written notices to the slc  we recorded a contingent liability totaling million  which was included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  and the related expenses were included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june  indemnification obligations we indemnify  as permitted under delaware law and in accordance with our bylaws  our officers  directors and members of our senior management for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while they were serving at our request in such capacity 
in this regard  we have received  or expect to receive  requests for indemnification by certain current and former officers  directors and employees in connection with our investigation of our historical stock option grant practices and related issues  and the related governmental inquiries and shareholder derivative litigation 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unknown and potentially unlimited  therefore  it cannot be estimated 
we have directors and officers liability insurance policies that may enable us to recover a portion of such future indemnification claims paid  subject to coverage limitations of the policies  and plan to make claim for reimbursement from our insurers of any potentially covered future indemnification payments 
prior software usage during april  as a result of an internal review we conducted  we determined that our use of certain third party software in prior periods exceeded the levels of usage authorized under license agreements in effect for such periods 
we have negotiated and intend to continue negotiating new license agreements in order to obtain the rights and authorization necessary to meet our current software usage requirements 
we believe that it is probable that the licensors of this software will  as part of these negotiations  seek compensation from us relating to this prior usage 
while we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these negotiations  we have recorded million as our best estimate of the amount expected to be paid 
the amount was included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  and the related expenses were included in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june  general from time to time  we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
while we cannot be certain about the ultimate outcome of any litigation  management does not believe any pending legal proceeding will result in a judgment or settlement that will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operation or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and investment risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we currently have operations in the united states  taiwan  china  hong kong and japan 
the functional currency of all our operations is the us dollar 
however  approximately million or of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments including investments in umc are held outside the united states  primarily in hong kong 
in addition  income taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although personnel and facilities related expenses are primarily incurred in local currencies due to the location of our subsidiaries outside the united states  substantially all of our other expenses are incurred in us dollars 
while we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated primarily in us dollars  an increasing portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand our overseas operations 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
since we have research and development facilities in shanghai and beijing  china and sales liaison offices in shanghai  beijing and shenzhen  china  our operating expenses may increase in the future due to the continued appreciation of china s currency  renminbi  compared to the us dollar 
interest rate risk we currently maintain our cash equivalents primarily in money market funds  certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of june   we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  of which million is cash  million is money market funds and million is certificates of deposit 
we will continue to invest a significant portion of our existing cash equivalents in interest bearing  investment grade 
table of contents securities  with maturities of less than three months 
we do not believe that our investments  in the aggregate  have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments in public companies 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments are invested in foreign and domestic technology companies and are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industry in which these companies participate 
during the fiscal year ended june   we wrote down our umc investment from million to million as a result of recording an other than temporary impairment charge of million 
we will continue to monitor this investment for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our income and cash flows 
however  the existence of a number of external factors such as continued market volatility  credit crunch  as well as mergers and acquisitions  could have a negative material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
we are also exposed to changes in the value of our investments in privately held companies  including privately held start up companies 
long term equity investments in technology companies are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the industries in which these companies participate and other factors 
as of june   the balance of our long term equity investments in privately held companies was approximately million
