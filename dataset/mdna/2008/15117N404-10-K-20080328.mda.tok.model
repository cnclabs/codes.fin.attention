item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview celsion is a biotechnology company dedicated to furthering the development and commercialization of oncology drugs including tumor targeting treatments using focused heat energy in combination with heat activated drug delivery 
we are currently engaged in the development of treatment systems using a combination of heat and drugs developed on our proprietary heat activated liposomal technology platform 
our first drug  thermodox  an encapsulation of doxorubicin  a common oncology drug  in our heat activated liposome  is in clinical studies for the treatment of liver cancer and breast cancer 
in  we obtained premarketing approval pma from the fda to use our microwave based microfocus heat therapy system on surface and subsurface tumors in conjunction with radiation therapy 
we marketed this system until from until early in  we engaged in research and development of new treatment systems 
on january   we transferred all of our rights to the microfocus  together will all associated technology  to celsion canada ltd 
and on the same day sold all the stock of celsion canada to our founder and former officer and director  dr 
augustine cheung 
on february   we obtained a pma for the prolieve thermodilatation system for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph 
from through june  prolieve was marketed and sold through our commercial distributor  boston scientific 
on june   we sold all of our prolieve assets to boston scientific 
development pipeline our pipeline presently consists of the following product  in the indicated stage of development product status thermodox doxorubicin encapsulated in our heat activated liposome plus heat for the treatment of cancer we have recently completed a phase i clinical study to establish the maximum tolerable dose  the safety  and the pharmacokinetics of thermodox used in conjunction with radio frequency ablation in the treatment of liver cancer 
the study was conducted at the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health and queen mary s hospital in hong kong 
we are currently conducting a confirmatory phase i clinical study for our single vial formulation of thermodox used in conjunction with radio frequency ablation in the treatment of liver cancer 
this study is being performed at the cleveland clinic and north shore long island jewish health system 
we expect to begin a phase iii study in the first quarter of to determine the efficacy of thermodox in combination with rfa in the treatment of primary liver cancer 
the study will incorporate approximately clinical sites in north america  italy  china  taiwan  hong kong  and korea and is planned to enroll a total of patients 
we are also sponsoring the conduct of an investigator sponsored phase i study of the use of thermodox for the treatment of recurrent breast cancer at the chest wall rcw 
from to  we generated only minimal revenues and funded our operations primarily through private placements of our equity securities 
during  following fda premarketing approval of the prolieve thermodilatation system  we received a one time licensing fee of million under our agreement with boston scientific  the former distributor of our prolieve system 
from through june  sales of prolieve products generated revenues of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale of the prolieve assets to bsc  along with raising additional equity  is anticipated to generate sufficient funding until such time as we are able to complete development and testing of  and gain necessary regulatory approvals for  one or more of our products 
while the company is currently funded from the available cash resources and amounts due from the sale of the prolieve assets  we anticipate that in the longer term revenues will be generated from licensing fees paid for our technologies by pharmaceutical manufacturers and royalties generated from eventual product sales to major institutional health care providers 
in the event that such licensing fees are not forthcoming and or the company elects to make investments in additional drug development and or commercial opportunities  funding will be generated from sale of our equity securities 
costs our principal costs consist of research and development costs  including licensing fees due in connection with various of our technologies  the costs of sponsored research and pre clinical and clinical trials for thermodox  the costs of development and design of other products  and corporate overhead 
our research and development activities  preclinical tests and clinical trials  and the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of each of our products  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
we may not bring to market any product in the us without a premarketing approval from the fda 
we are currently conducting basic research and development activities  pursuing prototype products through clinical testing and regulatory approval 
our ultimate objective is to commercialize those products to generate a return on investment for our stockholders through one of several means including a selling products directly to end users  b selling products through a distributor  or c licensing the technology to third parties and generating income through royalties and milestone payments

the study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of thermodox in combination with radio frequency ablation 
the study will incorporate approximately clinical sites in north america  italy  china  taiwan  hong kong  and korea and is planned to enroll a total of patients 
the company expects to enroll the first patient in the study by the end of the first quarter of on january   the fda provided a favorable written response to celsion on its proposed open label  single arm phase ii study in patients with rcw 
the agency agreed with the patient population as defined by celsion  an objective response endpoint  and confirmed that depending on the final data obtained  that this study could be used to support an nda submission 
in light of this positive response from the fda  celsion is planning and working diligently to enable this phase ii study to commence as soon as a safe dose for multiple thermodox treatments per patient  in this patient population  is determined from the phase i 
celsion anticipates that this phase ii study will commence enrollment late in and will be completed in critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements  which appear at item to this annual report on form k  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that the company make certain assumptions and estimates and  in connection therewith  adopt certain accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to our financial statements 
of those policies  we believe that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and may be more critical to an accurate reflection of our financial condition and results of operations we have stock option plans that provide for non qualified and incentive stock options to be issued to directors  officers  employees and consultants 
prior to january   we accounted for options issued under the plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based compensation cost related to employee stock options was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended december  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
we use the black scholes model for determining the fair value of our options granted 
the black scholes model was originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have different characteristics from celsion s incentive and non qualified stock options 
the model is also sensitive to changes in assumptions  which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
as a result of adopting statement r on january   the company s loss before income taxes and net loss for the year ended december  is million higher than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under opinion as a result of adopting statement r on january   the company s reported basic loss per share and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  are higher than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under opinion we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies on an ongoing basis to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosure system provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of the process  the company reviews the selection  application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates and the methods by which they are determined on an ongoing basis 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates

the loss from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increased loss was the result of increases in research and development expenses related to the company s shift from a device focused enterprise to a drug development company 
general and administrative expenses also increased as the company recruited and relocated new members of its management team and accrued severance and separation costs to those employees terminated with the sale of the prolieve assets 
also contributing to the increased loss when comparing to was the non recurring gain related to the sale of celsion canada in of million 
the increase of million  or  in research and development expense during the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was due to s increase in clinical costs including the start up of a second phase i study and costs associated with filing the primary liver cancer phase iii protocol through the special protocol assessment process increase in drug manufacturing costs related to production of single vial product at third party manufacturer increase in clinical salaries and benefits due to additional staff increase in preclinical costs increase in patient recruiting costs increase in recruiting and relocation costs decrease in royalty fees related to gene development decrease in temporary help decrease in legal and patent costs decrease in professional fees during the year ended december   the company incurred a number of non recurring charges due to the sale of prolieve and charges due to the restructuring of the company in a non prolieve environment

there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options included in net loss for the year ended december  because the company did not adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  but rather used the alternative intrinsic value method 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or as compared to net sales of million for the prior year 
product sales consist of sales of the prolieve products and are comprised of two elements sales of control units and sales of disposable catheter kits  all to celsion s exclusive distributor  boston scientific 
the decrease in sales during was due to an interruption in the supply of product during the second and third quarters of  caused by a product recall of the disposable prolieve catheter kits 
the product recall was the result of issues in the manufacturing process following the transition to a new supplier 
all of the costs related to this product recall were accrued in gross profit for amounted to million as compared to million in  an increase of million  or  for the year 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased to of net sales during the year ended december  as compared to of net sales for the year ended december  the increase of gross margin as a percentage of net sales was the result of purchasing lower cost catheter kits from a new supplier 
research and development expenses amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year was due primarily to a million reduction in consulting support and development costs for the prolieve system  decreased research and development activities associated with our breast cancer treatment device and heat activated gene technology  which reduced research and development costs by an aggregate of million  and a one time termination fee amounting to million incurred in related to the migration of manufacturing of catheter kits to a new supplier

interest income for the year ended december  amounted to million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was the result of higher average principal balances in part due to the drawdown of loans from boston scientific on february  and july  and higher yields earned on our investments 
interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to the drawdown of the second installment of the bsc loan on february  in the amount of million and the third installment on july  million as well as a full year of interest expense on the first loan installment of million received from boston scientific on august  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our core business activity is to develop products to treat cancer and other diseases  and to commercialize those products to generate a return on investment for stockholders through one of several means including selling drugs directly to end users  selling drugs through a distributor  licensing our technology to third parties and generating income through royalties and milestone payments  and outright sale of a technology directly or  ultimately  though the sale of the entire company 
our business model will generate uneven cash flows  as continuing research and development expenditures will not necessarily be matched by revenues from one of the above sources 
in the event that our annual research and development expenditures are not covered by current resources  funding will be provided from other sources including any potential future income generated from licensing agreements and debt or equity funding raised in the capital markets 
since inception  our expenses have significantly and regularly exceeded our revenues  and we have an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  revenue from the sales of our prolieve units  and ultimately  the sale of the prolieve assets 
at december   we had total current assets of million including cash and short term investments of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in a working capital surplus of million 
at december   we had total current assets of million including million in cash and short term investments and current liabilities of million  which resulted in working capital of million at such date 
the increase in working capital is directly related to the sale of our prolieve assets for million 
after repayment of principal and interest of million under the loan to boston scientific and the payment of licensing and other fees  we netted million at closing on june  the balance of million was recorded as a receivable  million of which is a current asset 
our short term investments consist of auction rate certificates and auction preferred securities 
auction rate certificates are municipal bonds which pay interest at a floating rate set periodically  usually for  or days 
auction preferred securities are issued by closed end bond funds and generally pay dividends every  or days 
increases or withdrawals from investments can generally take place every  or days depending on the recurring auction date  if such auction occurs 
both investment vehicles are rated ap commercial paper equivalents  trade at par and do not have significant market fluctuations 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this net cash requirement was funded from cash on hand at the beginning of the year  together with the proceeds form the sale of the prolieve assets 
in  the cash provided by investing activities was million and was primarily the result of the proceeds of first payment by boston scientific under the prolieve asset purchase agreement of million  which was offset by the repayment of the loan and interest due to boston scientific of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  which represents the purchase of treasury stock of million  payments made on the loan to finance insurance premiums of million  which were offset by the proceeds of the note payable of million 
as mentioned above  the company purchased  shares of its common stock that was held by boston scientific corporation 
the purchase price was million  which is per share 
the company may reissue those shares in the future at our discretion 
although the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes nols  as described below  the deduction of nols is limited for alternative minimum tax amt purposes 
as a result  the company recorded income tax expense of million in the year ended december  the income tax expense is directly related to the gain on the sale of the prolieve assets in june and the amt is currently due 
subsequent to the sale of the prolieve assets in june and prior to the filing of the company s tax return  it was discovered that the company was obligated to pay additional amt in the amount of million in addition to the million recorded in the second quarter of 
this additional amount of million was recognized in the fourth quarter financial results 
as of december   we had nols of approximately million  which expire  if unused  by the year these nols may be determined to be restricted in their future use due to various irs utilization rules 
approximate amount of unused operating loss carryforwards expiration during year ended for the year ending december   we expect to expend approximately million for clinical testing of liver cancer and breast cancer treatment systems  and for corporate overhead  both of which we expect to fund from funds on hand and the collection of the receivable from boston scientific 
the foregoing is an estimate  based upon assumptions as to the scheduling of institutional clinical research and testing personnel  the timing of clinical trials and other factors  not all of which are fully predictable 
the company does not believe that inflation had a material affect on its reported sales or net loss for the years reported 
our contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total one year or less two to three years four to five years after five years dollars in millions operating leases property total contractual obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities and currently do not enter into any transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
thus  our exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations is minimal
