item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview the principal goal of wesco s management is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions  nor do fluctuations in annual net income 
to accomplish desired growth  a high priority is placed on the purchases of companies having excellent economic characteristics  run by outstanding managers 
management strives also to invest 
table of contents in common stocks of outstanding publicly traded companies at prices deemed reasonable 
in the event that such investments are not available  as has often been the case in recent years  capital is preserved through investments principally in high quality cash equivalents and securities of the us government and its agencies 
wesco s operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis 
there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions such as sales  marketing  purchasing  legal or human resources and there is minimal involvement by wesco s management in the day to day business activities of the operating businesses 
wesco s chairman  president and chief executive officer  charles t 
munger  is also vice chairman of berkshire hathaway  and consults with warren e 
buffett  chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway  with respect to wesco s investment decisions  major capital allocations  and the selection of the chief executives to head each of wesco s operating units  subject to ultimate approval of wesco s board of directors 
the operations of wesco s wesco financial insurance company wes fic subsidiary are managed by berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company nico subsidiary 
wes fic participates principally in reinsurance contracts in which nico and other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate in the reinsurance of property and casualty risks of unaffiliated insurance companies 
terms of wes fic s participation are essentially identical to those by which the other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate  except as to the percentages of participation see item  business  for further information 
financial information relative to these participations appearing in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated financial statements  is identified as affiliated business 
financial condition wesco continues to have a strong consolidated balance sheet at december   with relatively little debt 
liquidity  which has traditionally been high  has been higher than usual for the past several years due principally to sales  maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity and other investments  and reinvestment of the proceeds  mainly in cash equivalents pending redeployment for the long term 
in the latter half of  million  net  was invested in marketable equity securities 
principally as a result  the company s consolidated balance sheet reflects marketable equity securities with fair value of billion as of yearend  versus billion as of yearend wesco s equity investments are in strong  well known companies 
the practice of concentrating in a few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire hathaway  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
wesco has no investments in subprime loans 
results of operations wesco s consolidated net income has fluctuated from year to year  often significantly  as a result of the realization of gains on investments 
realized gains amounted to million million  after taxes for and million million  after income taxes for no gains or losses were realized in the investment gains realized in resulted principally from the exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with pg s acquisition of gillette in the fourth quarter of the amount  if any  of realized gain or loss in any year has no predictive value and variations in amount from year to year have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio at each balance sheet date 
wesco s consolidated after tax income  excluding realized investment gains  increased by million for the year  due mainly to increased investment and underwriting income earned by the insurance businesses  significantly offset by increased operating expenses of the furniture rental business  as the company s cort business services corporation subsidiary expands and redirects the marketing of its rental relocation services from targeting individuals to targeting corporate clients 

table of contents financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up million from the billion per share at december  shareholders equity included million at december   and million at december   representing appreciation in market value of investments  which is credited directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes  without being reflected in earnings 
because unrealized appreciation is recorded using market quotations  gains or losses ultimately realized upon sale of investments could differ substantially from recorded unrealized appreciation 
the unrealized gain component amounted to of shareholders equity at december   versus one year earlier 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  except as to million at each yearend  these amounts related to a million revolving credit facility used in cort s furniture rental business 
in addition to this recorded debt  wesco and its subsidiaries had million of operating lease and other contractual obligations at december   versus million one year earlier 
see the section on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on debt 
wesco s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  totaled million versus million at december  wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations wesco s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how wesco s top management views those business activities 
wesco s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations underwriting and investing  and believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of their financial performance 
underwriting gain or loss represents the simple arithmetic difference between the following line items appearing on the consolidated statement of income insurance premiums earned  less insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and insurance underwriting expenses 
management s goal is to generate underwriting gains over the long term 
underwriting results are evaluated without allocation of investment income 
the consolidated data in the second table in item are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenues  including realized net investment gains  are followed by costs and expenses  and a provision for income taxes  to arrive at net income 
the following summary sets forth the after tax contribution to gaap net income of each business segment insurance  furniture rental and industrial as well as activities not considered related to such segments 
realized net investment gains are excluded from segment activities  consistent with the way wesco s management views the business operations 
amounts are in thousands  all after income tax effect 
year ended december  insurance segment underwriting investment income furniture rental segment industrial segment nonsegment items other than investment gains realized investment gains consolidated net income in the following sections the data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 

table of contents insurance segment wesco engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks through wesco financial insurance company wes fic and the kansas bankers surety company kbs 
their operations are conducted or supervised by wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway  wesco s ultimate parent company 
in reinsurance activities  defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities are assumed 
in primary insurance activities  defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks are assumed 
for purposes of the following discussion  the results have been disaggregated between reinsurance and primary insurance activities 
following is a summary of the insurance segment s underwriting activities 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  insurance premiums written reinsurance primary total insurance premiums earned reinsurance primary total insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses underwriting gain  before income taxes reinsurance primary total income taxes underwriting gain the nature of wes fic s participation in the aviation related reinsurance contracts requires that estimates be made not only as to losses and expenses incurred  but also as to premiums written  due to a time lag in reporting by the ceding pools 
in addition  periodic underwriting results can be affected significantly by changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including amounts established for occurrences in prior years 
see the critical accounting policies section of this discussion for information concerning the loss reserve estimation process 
reinsurance premiums written for decreased by million  and earned reinsurance premiums increased by million  from the corresponding figures  despite the increase in the level at which wes fic participated in the hull and liability pools in as competition has intensified in the aviation market  the pools have experienced greater pricing pressures and have continued to exercise underwriting discipline by not writing policies where pricing was deemed inadequate with respect to the risks assumed 
written premiums for increased by  and earned reinsurance premiums increased by  from those of these increases were attributed principally to the higher level of participation in the hull and liability pools in  as well as an increase in the volume of business written by the workers compensation pool 
intensifying competitive pressures  which negatively affected written premiums for  more significantly affected written premiums for reinsurance activities have fluctuated from year to year as participations in reinsurance contracts have become available both through insurance subsidiaries of berkshire and otherwise 
see item  business  for information about wes fic s participation in a an additional quota share reinsurance contract  expected to 
table of contents significantly increase its premium volume over a five year period beginning in the level of business written by wes fic in future periods will also vary  perhaps materially  based upon market conditions and management s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates 
written primary insurance premiums decreased by million in both and  representing decreases of for and for kbs has experienced intensified price competition during the past approximately two years  and has reacted through the exercise of underwriting discipline 
management believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of financial performance of insurance companies 
when stated as a percentage  the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses  divided by premiums  gives the combined ratio 
a combined ratio of less than connotes an underwriting profit and a combined ratio of greater than connotes an underwriting loss 
the ratio is figured on a pre tax basis 
underwriting results of wesco s insurance segment have generally been favorable  but have fluctuated from year to year for various reasons  including competitiveness of pricing in terms of premiums charged for risks assumed  and volatility of losses incurred 
for  and  reinsurance generated underwriting gains of million  million and million  representing combined ratios of  and  all of which management considers to have been favorable 
the figures for the two most recent years reflect the detrimental effects of increasingly competitive pressures which have resulted in the ongoing softening of prices in terms of premiums charged throughout those years 
the figure also reflects less favorable claims experience in the latter half of the year  with respect to the hull and liability contracts  where wes fic s participation increased by percent for that year 
had it not been for net favorable reserve development of million in  essentially all of which related to the aviation related contracts  reinsurance activities for would have generated an underwriting loss of million million  after taxes 
the underwriting results for and also include net favorable unfavorable reserve development of million for  comprised of unfavorable development of million attributable to the aviation related contracts  partially offset by million of favorable development for a contract whose coverage period ended in  and million for  attributable to the aviation related contracts 
the figure also reflects estimated losses of million  before taxes  related to hurricane katrina  which struck the gulf coast of the united states in the third quarter 
combined ratios from primary insurance were  and for  and  which management considers to have been favorable 
in  pre tax underwriting results improved by million and included net favorable reserve development of million associated with estimates of losses recorded in several previous years  most notably  the reversal of a million estimated loss recorded in  following a recent court decision 
in  pre tax underwriting results from primary insurance declined by million from those of underwriting results from primary insurance included net unfavorable loss development of million and million  before taxes  for and  amounts not considered significant 
it should be noted that the profitability of a reinsurance or insurance arrangement is better assessed after all losses and expenses have been realized  perhaps many years after the coverage period  rather than for any given reporting period 
no trends have been identified which directly relate to losses  other than the effects from the current trend of increasing competition  causing declining premium rates 
losses incurred by wesco s insurance segment  by their very nature  occur unexpectedly and fluctuate from period to period in both frequency and magnitude 
wesco s insurers cede minimal amounts of their direct business  and as a result underwriting results may be volatile 
the income tax provision associated with the insurance segment s underwriting activities for benefited by million relating to the resolution of an issue raised in an examination of prior year income tax returns by the internal revenue service 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
in spite of partial relief provided to the insurance industry by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in and amended by the terrorism risk extension act of  and 
table of contents the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted 
management  however  does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wesco s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
losses from terrorism could  however  significantly impact wesco s periodic reported earnings 
other industry concerns in recent years have included exposures to losses relating to environmental contamination and asbestos 
management currently believes such exposures to be minimal 
following is a summary of investment income produced by wesco s insurance segment in thousands of dollars 
year ended december  investment income  before taxes income taxes investment income  after taxes investment income of the insurance segment comprises dividends and interest earned principally from the investment of shareholder capital including reinvested earnings as well as float principally  premiums received before payment of related claims and expenses 
the million increase in pre tax investment income for reflected a million increase in dividend income  attributable principally to the investment of million  net  in equity securities in the latter part of  partially offset by a decline in interest income resulting mainly from the use of interest bearing cash equivalents and fixed maturity investments for the purchase of the equity securities 
the increase of million in investment income for was due principally to higher interest rates earned on short term investments 
dividend income improved slightly 
wesco continues to seek to invest cash balances in the purchase of businesses and in long term equity holdings 
wesco s insurance subsidiaries  as a matter of practice  maintain liquidity in amounts which exceed by wide margins expected near term requirements for payment of claims and expenses 
as a result  it would be unlikely that any unanticipated payment of claims or expenses would require the liquidation of investments at a loss 
wesco does not attempt to match long term investment maturities to estimated durations of claim liabilities 
reference is made to the table of contractual obligations appearing on page 
table of contents furniture rental segment following is a summary of the results of operations of cort business services corporation cort  wesco s furniture rental segment 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues furniture rentals furniture sales service fees cost of rentals  sales and fees selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense income before income taxes income taxes segment net income furniture rental revenues for increased million from those of  after increasing million for from those of excluding rental revenues from trade shows and locations not in operation throughout each year  rental revenues for decreased from those of  following an increase of approximately in the preceding year 
the number of furniture leases outstanding at yearend was lower than at yearend  following a decline of in the preceding year 
the decrease in the number of outstanding leases continues a trend that developed late in  believed to be due principally to non renewals of leases generated in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita  increased energy prices  and customer uncertainty as to future economic conditions 
despite the continued decline in the number of furniture leases outstanding  furniture rental revenues have grown due mainly to increased demand for events and tradeshows and improved pricing 
furniture sales revenues for decreased million from those of  following a decrease in of million from those of the decreases are believed to be attributed principally to the continued softening of the housing market and higher energy prices that have contributed to an industry wide decline in retail furniture sales 
service fees for increased million after a decreasing million in from those reported for traditionally  the furniture segment has concentrated the marketing efforts of its relocation services towards individual residential customers 
late in  cort began a new initiative to expand the variety of its relocation services  and it redirected the thrust of this activity toward providing these services to corporate relocation departments for their relocating employees in need of temporary or longer term housing 
although initial traction has been slow  management is hopeful that the expansion of facilities and personnel devoted to rental relocation services  as well as the change in focus of its relocation activities  will result in profitable long term revenue growth 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for  versus for  and for the decrease in costs as percentages of revenues have been due principally to improvement in revenue mix  with a larger percentage of each successive year s revenue attributable to furniture rentals  which has a higher margin than furniture sales 
selling  general  administrative and interest expenses operating expenses for the segment were million for  up from the million incurred for  following an increase of from the million incurred for the increase in operating expenses in was due principally to 
table of contents an increase in advertising and personnel related costs associated with the rental relocation service as cort continues to redirect and expand its marketing efforts to target corporate clients 
income before income taxes for the furniture rental segment amounted to million in  versus million in  and million in the decrease in pre tax operating results for was principally attributable to the significant increase in operating expenses  offset somewhat by increased gross profits resulting from changes in revenue mix 
the improvement in resulted significantly from increasing revenues  change in revenue mix  and the continued focus on controlling operating expenses 
industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services income before income taxes income taxes segment net income the operations of the industrial segment have suffered a variety of ongoing difficulties for a number of years  including periodic economic downturns  a shift of production by many customers from domestic to overseas facilities  intensifying competitive pressures among service centers for remaining domestic business  unprecedented ability of the major steel producers in recent years to raise prices and establish minimum order quantities  following consolidation in the industry  and intensified competitive pressures for product from suppliers and for sales 
in addition to a decline in the number of orders placed in recent years  there has also been a trend towards smaller sized orders 
the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors on wesco s industrial segment is demonstrated by the significant decline in sales volume  in terms of pounds sold  from an average of million pounds annually  over the three year period of through  to an average of million pounds annually  over the most recent three year period 
average industrial segment revenues have not declined as significantly  principally because many customers have generally accepted higher prices as wesco s industrial segment has struggled to maintain its margins 
in competition for sales intensified and prices softened  but remained substantially higher than in the early s 
the year started out well 
volume  in terms of pounds sold for the first quarter  increased by over the comparable figure for the first quarter for  however  as the year progressed  increasing competitive pressures and a slowdown in domestic manufacturing activity caused volume to decline and  by yearend  volume for the year was lower than in segment revenues for the year  however  increased by million 
approximately half of the increase in revenues was attributable to a large sale of toolroom supplies to a single customer 
excluding that transaction  segment revenues for increased by million over those of as progressed  demand slowed  and customers became more resistant to higher prices  primarily specialty stainless steel products  which in one year period increased on average by approximately  based principally on mill surcharges for chromium and nickel  as global demand for these basic commodities remained high 
revenues for the year decreased by million from those of excluding from revenues the extraordinarily large sale of toolroom supplies to the single customer  revenues for decreased by million as compared with those of sales volume  in terms or pounds sold  decreased by approximately 
as a result of the decline in volume somewhat offset by higher steel prices  income from operations declined by million for 
table of contents as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  precision steel and a subsidiary are involved in environmental litigation 
management anticipates that additional provisions and legal fees with respect to environmental remediation may be required in the future 
however  as of december   it was not possible to reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of additional costs or a range of costs  that may be required in connection with the matter 
although management does not anticipate that the ultimate impact of such provisions and costs  net of future insurance recoveries  if any  will be material in relation to wesco s shareholders equity  it believes that the effect on industrial segment and consolidated net income in any given period could be material 
unrelated to business segment operations wesco s consolidated earnings included net realized investment gains of million million  after taxes for  and million million  after taxes for of the latter amount  million  after taxes  resulted from wesco s non cash exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with the purchase of gillette by pg in the fourth quarter 
the million excess of fair value of the shares exchanged over wesco s original cost basis was recorded by wesco as a realized investment gain on october  the date of the transaction  as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
although the gain had a material impact on wesco s reported earnings for the fourth quarter of  there was no effect on shareholders equity 
wesco carried its investment in gillette at market value with unrealized gains reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the net unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity  as of september  federal income taxes are not currently payable as a result of the exchange 
no investment gains or losses were realized in management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
investment gains may also derive from non cash exchanges of securities for other investment securities as a result of merger activity involving the investees 
other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  wesco and its ms property company subsidiary reduced their liabilities for deferred income taxes by an aggregate of million 
that amount is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense of activities unrelated to business segments 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future results in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of participations in reinsurance contracts with members of the berkshire insurance group  such as the quota share arrangement described in item  business  which is expected to significantly increase the business of the insurance segment for a five year period beginning in  investment gains and losses  or unusual nonoperating items 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions  such as terrorist activity  and changes in the economy 
wesco is not presently suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed below 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or notes thereto 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain obligations  such as notes payable  accrued interest  and unpaid insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations as of december  follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total thereafter notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations payment of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures purchase obligations for capital expenditures other  principally deferred compensation totals amounts and timing of payments are significantly dependent on estimates 
see critical accounting policies and practices below 
principally  construction costs of ms property s luxury condominium development 
critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to the determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period reported upon 
in particular  estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of many years 
the estimates and assumptions are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances using information available at the time such estimates and assumptions are made 
the amounts of such assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available 
although wesco s management does not believe such changes in estimates would have a materially adverse effect on shareholders equity  they could produce a material effect on results of operations in a reporting period 

table of contents investments the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading and available for sale 
in recent years  all equity and fixed maturity investments have been classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
rental furniture rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive in quantity  for sale 
rental furniture is carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
revenue recognition insurance premiums are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers and are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
premiums are estimated with respect to certain reinsurance contracts written during the period where reports from ceding companies for the period are not contractually due until after the balance sheet date 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring insurance premiums commissions  premium taxes  and other are deferred and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contract period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
liabilities for insurance losses are comprised of estimates for reported claims case reserves  and reserve development on reported claims and estimates for claims that have not yet been reported some of which may not be reported for many years  which together are also referred to as incurred but not reported reserves ibnr reserves 
the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims and include estimates reported by ceding insurers 
loss reserve estimates reflect past loss experience  adjusted as appropriate when losses are reasonably expected to deviate from experience 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
ceded reinsurance losses recoverable ceded reserves are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a component of accounts receivable 
depending on the type of loss being estimated  the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent  among other factors  upon the timing of the claim reporting by cedants and insureds  and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amounts through the loss adjustment process 
judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred 
the time period between the claim occurrence date and payment date of the loss is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have fairly short claim tails  and  absent litigation  are reported and 
table of contents settled within a few months or years after occurrence 
casualty losses usually have very long claim tails 
casualty claims can be more susceptible to litigation and can be more significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment  which contributes to extended claim tails 
claim tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices 
actual ultimate loss settlement amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates  referred to as loss development  are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
wes fic and kbs do not use consultants to assist in reserving activities 
following is a summary of wesco s consolidated liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reinsurance recoverables in thousands of dollars 
december  december  case reserves ibnr reserves gross liability before ceded reinsurance ceded reserves net reserves represents principally  wes fic s proportionate share of reinsurance purchased by the aviation pools 
the techniques and processes employed in estimating loss reserves are differentiated between reinsurance and primary insurance 
reinsurance historically  wes fic s property and casualty loss reserves derive from individual risk  multi line and catastrophe reinsurance policies 
however  wes fic s reinsurance activity in recent years has consisted almost exclusively of participations in aviation related pools that are underwritten and managed by a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of wesco s parent company  berkshire hathaway inc non aviation reinsurance reserve amounts were less than of wesco s gross consolidated reserves as of december  and december  mostly in ibnr reserves and primarily related to a quota share contract that has been in runoff for more than years  under which wes fic continues to make loss payments 
such amounts reflected loss estimates reported by the ceding companies and additional ibnr reserves estimates by wes fic management  which were mainly a function of reported losses from ceding companies  anticipated loss ratios for the contract period  and management s judgment as to the loss reserving adequacy of the ceding companies 
gross aviation loss reserves were approximately million at december  and million at december  million and million  net of reinsurance  at those dates  of which gross ibnr reserves were approximately million and million  respectively 
losses from aviation coverages generally have reasonably short tails with respect to the property components 
the claim tail for the liability coverage can be somewhat longer  especially when litigation results 
the case reserving process for aviation risks is believed to involve less uncertainty than for many other types of insurance  because loss events tend to become known and reported relatively soon after the events occur 
the material judgments underlying the loss reserving by the aviation pools manager assume that future loss patterns incurred and paid will be similar to those of the past 
the aviation pools manager establishes case and ibnr reserves and manages the claims settlement process  including payment of the related claims 
wes fic is allocated its share of these amounts  monthly 
the pools manager has considerable experience with aviation insurance and claims 
wes fic management reviews reported claim amounts for reasonableness and has historically accepted the amounts without further adjustment  except for adjustments made for minor reporting delays 

table of contents wes fic management is represented at regular meetings and presentations held by the pools manager  and wesco believes that wes fic is able to closely monitor and assess the pools manager s judgments concerning reserves 
considerable judgment is required to evaluate claims and estimate claims liabilities in connection with reinsurance contracts 
as further data become available  the liabilities are reevaluated and adjusted as appropriate 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
primary insurance loss reserves from wesco s primary insurance activities derive from individual risk policies written by kbs  which primarily provides specialty coverages for financial institutions 
reserve amounts are comprised of case estimates and estimates of ibnr reserves  which approximated million at both yearends of and because of the relatively low number or frequency of losses and potential for higher severity or amount per claim  kbs management is familiar with and closely monitors each claim 
losses generally are expected to have a relatively short reporting and claim tail due to the nature of the claims 
kbs provides deposit guaranty bonds  which insure deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance limits  crime insurance  check kiting fraud indemnification  internet banking catastrophe theft insurance  directors and officers liability  bank employment practices  as well as bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnity 
as a result  reserves are primarily developed from case estimates  reducing the need for extended actuarial studies and broad estimates of ibnr of the nature typically performed by large primary insurers whose business volume requires such procedures for the development of their loss data 
a range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared 
goodwill goodwill of acquired businesses represents the excess of the cost of acquired entities principally cort over the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter of each year using a variety of methods that require that certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding economic factors and future profitability 
impairments  if any  are charged to earnings 
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses  determined on a specific identification basis  are included in the consolidated statement of income  as are provisions for other than temporary declines in market or estimated fair value  when applicable 
factors considered in judging whether an impairment is other than temporary include the financial condition  business prospects and creditworthiness of the issuer  the length of time that fair value has been less than cost  the relative amount of the decline  and wesco s ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial liquidity as well as substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
its fixed maturity investments are backed by the us government and its agencies 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
apart from investments  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as 
table of contents changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained billion of marketable equity securities stated at market value  up from billion one year earlier 
the increase was due principally to the purchase of million  net  of marketable equity securities in the latter part of net unrealized appreciation increased million during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   four investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity securities portfolio 
the four largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  billion  combined were common stocks of the procter gamble company  the coca cola company  kraft foods inc and wells fargo company  of which the first three have significant global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the latter has significant mortgage lending operations and is exposed to the weakening domestic credit market caused mainly by accelerating weakness in the domestic housing market 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity as well as much liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 

table of contents interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  versus billion of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities with fixed maturities one year earlier 
consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or other factors as of december  are considered insignificant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
wesco  as a matter of practice  invests only in fixed maturity securities of the highest quality 
as of yearend  its fixed maturity investments consisted of securities of the us treasury and of agencies of the us government
