item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview our business we are engaged in the development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of vascular disease 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms  or aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately  making it a leading cause of death in the united states 
prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
prior to that we developed  manufactured and marketed other catheter and stent products for treatment of cardiovascular disease 
between and  our source of revenues shifted gradually from direct sales of previous catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed to guidant corporation rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents in exchange for milestone and royalty payments 
our license revenue increased in over due to our licensing agreement with biolucent  inc under that agreement  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents 
license revenue from guidant remained at the contractual minimum level of  for and the minimum payment requirement of the agreement expired at december  we expect de minimus royalties under this agreement in  prior to its expiration in june  and that the sales of our powerlink system will be our only material source of revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and borrowings available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations through at least december  if we do not realize expected revenue and gross margin levels  or if we are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  or if we cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable ratio  we may not be able to fund our operations through december  in the event that we require additional funding to continue our operations  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that the required capital would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity would not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and this would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
summary of accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
we earn royalty revenue  which is included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties are recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
income taxes we reduce our deferred tax asset to zero due to uncertainties concerning the future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in a tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payments  or sfas r 
this statement requires us to recognize the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for the stock options it has awarded 
under sfas r  we are required to recognize compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
we elected to adopt sfas r on a modified prospective basis  accordingly  the financial statements 
table of contents for the periods prior to january  do not include stock based compensation under the fair value method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include such amounts based on our best estimates and judgments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to the expansion and increased productivity of our domestic field sales personnel  and increased market acceptance of the powerlink system 
domestic sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states doubled from million in to million in our distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences ag  or edwards lifesciences  was not renewed beyond the original expiration of december  sales to edwards lifesciences in were million 
we replaced the edwards lifesciences distribution agreement with a three year distribution agreement with lemaitre vascular 
this agreement named lemaitre vascular as the exclusive distributor of the powerlink system in ten european countries  including austria  belgium  the czech republic  france  germany  luxembourg  the netherlands  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
sales to lemaitre in were million 
license revenue 
license revenue increased to  in from  in  due to our licensing agreement with biolucent  inc under that agreement  we received  in royalties and fees  including a one time payment of  in exchange for a fully paid up license to certain of our patents in a certain field of use 
license revenue from guidant remained at the contractual minimum level of  for  equal to we expect that license revenue will decline sharply in as the minimum royalty provision of the agreement expired at december  the license will be fully paid up in june beginning on january   sales of our powerlink system will be our only material source of revenue 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is directly attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to  license revenue from biolucent inc  and a reduction in the per unit cost of product due to substitution of lower cost in house produced graft material in a portion of the products sold in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in for these reasons 
also  the percentage in was impacted by a second quarter charge of  related to the final phase of an earlier limited  voluntary product recall 
we believe that gross profit dollars will increase in future years due to higher commercial sales of the powerlink system both in and outside of the united states 
we also expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will increase further  into the to range as the substitution of in house produced eptfe graft material for higher cost purchased graft material becomes virtually complete in research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease primarily resulted from lower costs associated with clinical trials in the period 
we incurred a charge of  in and  in  for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  we expect that research  development  and clinical expense will range between to million in  to support new product and process development projects and ongoing clinical trials 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales and marketing functions in support of the commercial sales of the infrarenal powerlink system in the united states market 
we incurred a charge of  in and 
table of contents  in  respectively  for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in  but at a lesser rate than in  due to increased productivity of our tenured sales representatives within their territories 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due primarily to increases in patent and legal fees and insurance expenses 
in addition  compensation expense totaling  in as compared to  in  pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  we expect general and administrative expense to remain in the to million range in termination of supply agreement 
termination of supply agreement expense was  in the expense was due to the third amendment of our supply agreement with bard peripheral  dated september   which reduced the minimum purchase requirement for the year from million to million  and wherein both parties agreed to terminate the agreement on december  in consideration for the reduction in the minimum purchase requirement for the year  we paid  to bard peripheral 
other income 
other income increased to million from million in the increase in other income was a result of a realized gain of  on our investment in biolucent  inc  offset by less interest income due to a lower invested cash balance 
in  we had a higher cash balance due to a registered direct public offering of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of million in june comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to our investment in our domestic field sales personnel  and increased market acceptance of the powerlink system 
united states sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states did not change from million in and sales to edwards lifesciences decreased to million in from million in license revenue 
license revenue remained unchanged at  in and  which represented the contractual minimum annual amount from guidant 
cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to gross profit on product sales increased to million from million in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in this increase in gross profit margin was due to an increase in product sales in the united states 
direct product sales in the united states have a higher gross profit margin compared to international product sales  which are sold through distributors 
additionally  the percentage in was impacted by a product recall and a facility relocation which resulted in period charges to cost of sales in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
a charge of  related to the final phase of the product recall was incurred in the second quarter of research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from continued product research and development of our powerlink system product and complementary technologies  and continued enrollment in the suprarenal arm of the pivotal united states clinical trials 
a  charge for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january   also contributed to the increase 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales and marketing support functions in support of the expanded commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the united states market 
in addition  the 
table of contents increase was partially due to a  charge for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due to stock compensation expense totaling  pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  other income 
other income increased to million from  in  driven by higher interest income 
the increase in interest income was accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a registered direct public offering of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of million in june liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that would permit us to sell from time to time  up to a total of million of common stock 
in june  we completed an offering of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of million  leaving million available under the shelf registration 
additionally  in july  march and july  we completed three private placements of our common stock  resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million 
in february  we entered into a revolving credit facility  whereby we may borrow up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion is subject to an unused revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly  in arrears  on a calendar year basis  in an amount equal to one quarter of one percent per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  as determined by the bank 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and tangible net worth during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on february  as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  nevertheless  we expect to continue to incur substantial costs and cash outlays in and beyond to support powerlink system research and development  and united states marketing of the powerlink system 
if we fail to increase our penetration of the aaa market  or if we fail to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  as necessary  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
the timing and amount of our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of market acceptance of the powerlink system  our requirements for additional manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional it infrastructure and systems  our requirements for additional facility space  and the success of our clinical trials and our research and development programs for future products and processes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only money market instruments 
foreign currency transaction risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded   and  respectively  of foreign currency transaction gains losses
