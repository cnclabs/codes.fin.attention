item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview general 
we provide software based computer enabled detection  or ced  products and solutions that use advanced signal processing software algorithms to detect and monitor objects in a designated field of view 
our technology analyzes the signal from a sophisticated sensor and passes the information along to management systems  controllers or directly to users 
our core products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system and the rtms radar detection system  operate using our proprietary software in conjunction with video cameras or radar and commonly available electronic components 
each of these systems is used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite  our exclusive licensee in these regions 
rtms systems are sold to distributors and end users in north america 
we also sell both autoscope and rtms to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
end users of our products throughout the world are generally funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management or traffic law enforcement 
eis asset purchase 
on december   we purchased certain assets from eis electronic integrated systems inc  or eis  including its principal product line  the rtms system 
in its fiscal year ended september   eis had revenue of million  substantially all of which related to rtms sales 
our consolidated financial statements include revenue and expenses related to the operations of the former eis business from december  through december  within these expenses was a significant charge recognized for in process research and development related to intellectual property purchased as part of the transaction 
trends and challenges in our business 
we believe recent growth in our business can be attributed primarily to the following global trends worsening traffic caused by increased numbers of vehicles in metropolitan areas without corresponding expansions of roadway infrastructure  which has increased demand for our products  advances in information technology  which have made our products easier to market and implement  funding allocations for centralized traffic management services continue to rise in large cities  which has increased the ability of our primary end users to implement our products  and general increases in the cost effectiveness of electronics  which make our products more affordable for end users 
we believe our continued growth primarily depends upon continued adoption and governmental funding of its for traffic control in developed countries  
table of contents countries in the developing world adopting above ground detection technology  such as video or radar  instead of in pavement loop technology to manage traffic  use of ced to provide solutions to security surveillance and environmental issues associated with increasing automobile use in metropolitan areas  and our ability to develop new products  such as hybrid ced devices incorporating  for example  radar and video technologies  that provide increasingly accurate information and enhance the end users ability to cost effectively manage traffic  security surveillance and environmental issues 
because our principal end users are governmental entities  we are faced with challenges related to potential delays in purchase decisions by those entities and unforeseen changes in budgetary constraints 
these contingencies could result in significant and unforeseen fluctuations in our revenue between periods 
key financial terms and metrics 
revenue 
revenue historically has been derived from two sources royalties received from econolite for sales of the autoscope system in north america  the caribbean and latin america and revenue received from direct sales of autoscope systems in europe and asia 
royalties from econolite historically have provided the majority of our revenue 
we calculate the royalties using a profit sharing model where we split evenly the gross profit on sales of autoscope product made through econolite 
this royalty arrangement has the benefit of decreasing our cost of revenues and our selling  marketing and product support expenses because these costs and expenses are borne primarily by econolite 
although this royalty model has a positive impact on our gross margin  it also negatively impacts our total revenue  which would be higher if all the sales made by econolite were made directly by us 
the royalty arrangement is exclusive and expires in june our acquisition of the rtms product line  which we assemble  gives us an additional source of revenue that we expect will significantly increase our overall revenue and lessen fluctuations in our revenue from period to period due to our ownership of more than one product line and the higher volumes it brings  notwithstanding normal seasonality 
cost of revenue 
there is no cost of revenue related to econolite royalties  as virtually all manufacturing  warranty and related costs are incurred by econolite 
cost of revenue related to direct product sales consists primarily of the amount charged by our third party contractors to manufacture the autoscope and rtms hardware platforms  which is influenced mainly by the cost of electronic components 
the cost of revenue also includes logistics costs and estimated expenses for product warranties and inventory reserves 
the key metric that we follow is achieving certain gross margin percentages by geographic region 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses fall into three categories selling  marketing and product support  general and administrative  and research and development 
selling  marketing and product support expenses consist of various costs related to sales and support of our products  including salaries  benefits and commissions paid to our personnel  commissions paid to third parties  travel  trade show and advertising costs  second tier technical support for econolite  and primary technical support  where applicable 
general and administrative expenses consist of certain corporate and administrative functions that support the development and sales of our products and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses reflect management  supervisory and staff salaries and benefits  legal and auditing fees  travel  rent and costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  sarbanes oxley compliance  listing fees and annual reporting expenses 
research and development expenses consist mainly of salaries and benefits for our engineers and third party costs for consulting and prototyping 
we measure all operating expenses against our annually approved budget  which is developed with achieving a certain operating margin as a key focus 
also included in operating expenses is non cash expense for intangible asset amortization and in process research and development expense for technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
seasonality 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our first quarter generally is the weakest due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in north america  europe and northern asia 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting 
table of contents in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
history 
we were incorporated in the state of minnesota in december and began operations by pioneering the commercial application of wide area video vehicle detection for traffic management 
the technology underlying our products was initially developed at the university of minnesota 
in  the university was awarded a patent for that technology  which it exclusively licensed to us 
in  we sub licensed this technology to econolite  a leading manufacturer and seller of traffic control products in north america and the caribbean  to manufacture and distribute products incorporating the technology 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively 
year ended december  international sales north american sales royalties total revenue gross margin international sales gross margin north american sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles in process research and development income from operations income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was a result of growing acceptance of autoscope products in both europe and asia  resulting in new end users 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in royalty income reflects the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market 
north american sales were  in north american sales represent sales of rtms products from december   which is the date of the eis asset purchase 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect north american and international sales will increase substantially in due mainly to the addition of the rtms product line 
gross margins for international sales increased to in from in gross margins on royalty income increased to in from in international gross margins were positively impacted by a shift in product sales mix to higher margin products in versus royalty gross margins were positively impacted by the patent royalty we owed to the university of minnesota ending in the third quarter of we anticipate that gross margins for our international and north american sales will be in the ranges of to and to  respectively  in  while we expect royalty gross margins will be in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to headcount additions and 
table of contents increased promotional expense for the launch in april of our autoscope terra product line  which runs on our enhanced terra platform 
we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will increase significantly in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of total revenue in compared to due to the addition of rtms related expenses 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the increase resulted mainly from a combination of headcount additions  higher stock option and bonus expenses and  to a lesser extent  increased audit  tax  legal and consulting fees 
the expense included a  legal settlement with econolite 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase significantly in terms of actual expense in compared to due to the addition of rtms related expenses but will decrease as a percentage of total revenue in when compared to research and development expense decreased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the decrease was directly related to significant prototype material and consulting expenses incurred in accelerating technical efforts on our next generation autoscope terra product line in that did not carry into we anticipate that research and development expense will increase significantly in terms of actual expense in compared to due to the addition of rtms related expenses but will be flat as a percentage of total revenue in when compared to amortization of intangibles expense was  in and reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eis asset purchase from december  to december  assuming there are no changes to our intangible assets  we anticipate amortization expense to be approximately  in in process research and development expense was million in million net of tax 
this expense was a result of a purchase price allocation component related to the eis asset purchase and is one time in nature 
prior to the asset purchase  eis was engaged in research and development activity into its next generation product line  known internally as g g research activity began in because g had not yet reached technological feasibility  the value of the g program was expensed as in process research and development at the date of the eis asset purchase 
as of the date of the eis asset purchase  the program was estimated to be between and complete 
g  when released  is expected to provide new features and functionality and avoid existing patent claims of competitors based upon unique technology 
the value of the g program was appraised utilizing a multi period excess earnings cash flow analysis based upon facts and circumstances surrounding the in process development activities and the expected economic benefits to be derived from the resulting products 
key assumptions for the analysis include revenue from g products beginning in mid  achievement of an efficient cost to manufacture and a risk adjusted discount rate of on cash flows 
we estimate that we will incur from  to  in costs to complete the g program 
at the date of the eis asset purchase  eis was actively selling its g product  which has provided the majority of its revenues in the last two years 
if g is not commercialized according to plan  our financial projections may not be attained 
other income increased to  in from  in in  other income was mainly tax exempt interest income that was partially offset by interest expense on bank debt incurred in december in  interest income was also mainly tax exempt 
our income tax effective rate was not meaningful in due to the significant in process research and development expense impact on pre tax book income coupled with federal tax credits that brought our position to a benefit 
our income tax effective rate was unusually low due to a number of federal and refund claims 
we expect the effective rate in to be in the range of to 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was a result of better performance in our asian subsidiary  including a significant fourth quarter tunnel installation in china 
the increase in royalty income reflects the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market  including an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter in gross margins for international sales decreased to in from in gross margins on royalty income increased to in from in international gross margins were negatively impacted by slightly higher manufacturing costs and higher warranty reserves in versus royalty gross margins were positively impacted by the patent royalty we owed to the university of minnesota ending in the third quarter of selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to headcount additions 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the increase resulted mainly from a combination of headcount additions  stock option expense recognition  increased audit  tax  legal and consulting fees  and a  legal settlement with econolite 
research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to headcount additions and significant prototype material and consulting expenses incurred in accelerating technical efforts on our next generation autoscope terra product line 
other income increased to  in from  in increased interest income in was due to a combination of higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates relative to our income tax effective rate decreased to of pretax income in from in the decrease was due to a number of federal and state adjustments and increased research and development credits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the decrease were cash payments made in conjunction with the eis asset purchase and the restriction of cash as a result of our term loan with wells fargo 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to and million in and  respectively 
the major components of operating activities for were net income of  and the non cash in process research and development expense  net of tax  of million that were partially offset by the working capital impact of carrying higher accounts receivable and inventory balances 
at december   we no longer held any short term investments  and we had borrowed million on our term loan to partially fund the eis asset purchase 
we expect that the eis asset purchase will positively impact cash flows in as discussed below  any earn outs to the eis sellers for  and performance are due and payable the following year 
we have two credit agreements with wells fargo bank  na  a revolving line of credit and a term loan 
the revolving line of credit agreement provides up to million in short term borrowings at wells fargo s prime rate effective rate of at december   expiring may  outstanding borrowings are secured by inventories  accounts receivable and equipment  and wells fargo has the right of setoff against checking  savings and other accounts that we maintain with them 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement in or the term loan provides up to million in short term borrowings at wells fargo s prime rate less effective rate of at december   expiring september  any advances require that securities  cash or investments  or eligible investments be pledged against the loan so that the loan is no more than approximately of the eligible investments pledged 
in december  we borrowed million on this loan and pledged certain cash equivalents which are disclosed as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents after december   we invested a portion of our excess cash in auction rate securities and  as of february   we had million of these securities in our investment portfolio 
all of these auction rate securities are aaa rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and have contractual maturities from to further  all of these securities are collateralized by student loans and approximately of the collateral in the aggregate is guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
in february  we experienced failed auctions for our entire auction rate securities portfolio  resulting in our inability to sell these securities in the short term 
a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not signify a default by the issuer 
upon an auction failure  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based on a formula contained in the security  which generally is higher than the current market rate 
if we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal or until a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
we cannot predict if or when a successful auction or redemption may take place 
we do not believe we need access to these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on a quarterly basis for impairment or for the need to reclassify as long term investments 
all of the securities are due for auction in late march after december   the pledged collateral on the bank term loan was a combination of auction rate securities and money market funds 
as a result of the failed auctions  the auction rate securities no longer qualify as collateral for the term loan 
in march  we borrowed million from our revolving line of credit and used the proceeds to pay down our borrowings on the term loan to satisfy the bank s pledge formula requirement 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at february   along with our credit agreements with wells fargo and cash provided by operating activities  are adequate to fund our current business plan and maintain our collateral coverage and borrowing bases on our bank debt for  regardless of the liquidity of our auction rate securities 
we believe we will be able to extend our revolving line of credit upon expiration at terms similar to the current agreement 
in conjunction with our eis asset purchase  the sellers have an earn out arrangement over approximately three years 
the earn out is based on earnings from rtms sales less related cost of revenue and operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and is calculated annually 
if the earnings are at target levels  the sellers would receive million annually or million in total 
earn out payments generally are due within three months of the end of an earn out period 
the first earn out period runs from december  to december  thus  if any earn out payment is due for this period  it would be paid by march  if we are acquired or sell substantially all of our assets before december   we must pay eis million less earn out amounts previously paid as an acceleration of potential earn out payments under the eis asset purchase agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
our recorded goodwill relates to our hong kong based subsidiary  flow traffic ltd  and certain assets purchased from eis 
goodwill for the eis asset purchase was recorded in december and will be tested for impairment annually beginning in the flow traffic goodwill is tested for impairment on december of each year 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our subsidiary and then compare it to the carrying value of the subsidiary 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to determine if there is an impairment loss 
we estimate the fair value by using the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of flow traffic 
the future economic benefits are significantly dependent on future revenue growth 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december  and if flow traffic and the eis assets do not provide the future economic benefits we project  the fair value of these assets may become impaired  and we would 
table of contents need to record an impairment loss 
any earn outs related to the eis asset purchase will be recorded as additional goodwill in the year earned 
intangible assets are related to the eis asset purchase for trade names and technology and are amortized over their anticipated useful lives of five to eight years 
revenue recognition 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales delivered and accepted by its customers 
we recognize revenue from north american and international sales at the time of delivery and acceptance  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record provisions against sales revenue for estimated returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded based upon historical sales returns and changes in end user demands 
sales returns and warranty allowances are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance as deemed necessary based on our estimate of our future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
uncertain tax positions are recognized if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market and allowances have been made for obsolete  excess or unmarketable inventories based on estimated future usage or actual or anticipated product line changes 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position 
recognition is allowed if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we adopted fin in  and it did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement but does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in november  the fasb decided to issue a proposed staff position to partially defer for one year the implementation of sfas no 
the proposed deferral would apply to all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
the original effective date would continue to apply for items that are not subject to the proposed partial 
we currently are evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations

sfas no 
r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
this statement will impact us if we complete an acquisition after the effective date
