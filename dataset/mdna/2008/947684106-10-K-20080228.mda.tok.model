item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
see item a risk factors above regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results

collectively  these software products secure an organization s confidential data and increase the productivity of its employees so they can safely conduct business electronically with partners and over the internet 
fundamental to our products are proactive discovery of web and internal content  which is classified into highly granular database categories  and policy enforcement software that automates enforcement of pre defined business policies regarding acceptable users and uses of various content categories 
since we commenced operations in as a reseller of computer security products  websense has evolved into a leading provider of content security software solutions  including web security  email and messaging security and data loss prevention solutions 
our first web filtering software product was released in and prevented access to inappropriate web content 
since then  we focused on adapting our web filtering capabilities to address changing internet use patterns in the workplace and the growing threat of web based criminal activity 
in january  we entered the emerging market for data loss prevention and acquired portauthority technologies  inc portauthority  our technology development partner for dlp solutions 
in october  we acquired surfcontrol plc surfcontrol  a leading provider of web and email security software solutions  which expanded our product portfolio to include email security software and hosted web and email security solutions 
during  we derived of our revenue from international sales  compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately of our total revenue in both years 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific  latin american and australian markets 
we sell our products primarily through indirect channels 
in  we transitioned our web security products to a two tier distribution strategy in north america  to increase the number of value added resellers selling our products and further extend our reach into the small and medium sized business market segments 
our distribution strategy outside north america also relies on a two tier system of distributors and value added resellers 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to our products  including add on modules  on a daily straight line basis commencing on the day the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
in october  we closed our acquisition of surfcontrol and as a result incurred an operating loss under generally accepted accounting principles gaap during the fourth quarter of and for the fiscal year similar to websense  surfcontrol sold products primarily under subscriptions whereby revenues were recorded ratably over the term of the agreement 
under purchase accounting  we wrote off million of the deferred revenue of surfcontrol  leaving a balance of million as of the closing 
this adjustment reflects the fair value of the post contract technical support services that will be recognized daily in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue from the installed surfcontrol customer base until these subscriptions are up for renewal 
in connection with the acquisition  we have incurred restructuring costs primarily in connection with reducing surfcontrol headcount and eliminating redundant facilities 
we also immediately started to incur the expenses of operating the surfcontrol operations as well as recording the amortization of the acquired intangibles 
as a result  we expect to continue to operate at a loss under gaap until we generate sufficient revenue from the subsequent renewal of subscriptions from the installed surfcontrol customer base that offsets these expenses 
given the average remaining term of the surfcontrol subscriptions  we currently do not expect to operate at a profit under gaap in our ability to retain surfcontrol customers and maintain our overall pricing levels for our products will impact our results of operations and the timing of our return to profitability 
we allocate the total costs for human resources  employee benefits  payroll taxes  information technology  facilities  fixed asset depreciation and legal costs to each of our functional areas based on salaries and headcount data 
our overall costs to be allocated have increased as a result of the growth in our headcount and increased personnel costs  the growth of our facilities costs  and increased legal costs attributable to the increased complexity and maturity of our business and overall growth  and we expect this trend to continue 
in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol  we approved plans to restructure the operations of the acquired company through involuntarily terminating certain of surfcontrol s employees and exiting certain surfcontrol facilities 
we began formulating our restructuring plans for the operations of surfcontrol in april when the acquisition was first announced 
as of december   we have committed to a plan which includes involuntarily terminating approximately employees who were terminated beginning in the fourth quarter of and will be phased out throughout these workforce reductions are across all functions and geographies and affected employees were  or will be  provided cash severance packages 
additionally  we have exited  or will be exiting  leases in certain locations as well as reducing the square footage required to operate some locations 
we will finalize our facility exit plans during fiscal we have accrued the estimated costs associated with the employee severance and facility exit obligations as liabilities assumed in the purchase business combination 
accordingly  these estimated costs are included as part of the purchase price of surfcontrol 
changes to the estimates of these costs will be recorded in future periods either as a reduction to goodwill or as an expense to the results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for our products  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with our product subscription and provided throughout the subscription term 
prior to january   we recognized revenue on a monthly straight line basis  commencing with the month the subscription began 
effective as of january   we recognize revenue on a daily straight line basis commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the term of the subscription agreement  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectability is reasonably assured 
during  we re evaluated our revenue recognition policy in accordance with the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  and determined that our prior practice resulted in a material cumulative difference in our deferred revenue 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
in connection with the change in revenue recognition policy  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  and applied the special cumulative effect transition provision to our financial statements 
the cumulative net result was an increase in deferred revenue and a reduction in retained earnings  before tax impact  as of january  by million 
for  the impact of daily revenue recognition on subscriptions was to reduce revenue recognized by million  reduce net income by million  and increase deferred revenue by an additional million to a total increase of million when compared to what these amounts would have been under the monthly revenue recognition policy 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenue 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenue as the marketing service is provided 
we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
accounting for share based compensation 
through december   we accounted for share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb no 
apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  we recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our amended and restated stock incentive plan plan or predecessor plans or options granted as non plan inducement options during the year ended december  as all other options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with the employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  we disclosed net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method was applied in measuring compensation expense for share based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognized beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
the results for the years ended december  and include share based compensation expense of million and million excluding tax effects 
compensation expense related to share based awards is generally amortized over the vesting period in the related expense categories of the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas for periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of intangible assets  including acquired technology and customer relationships  is based on significant judgments made by management and accordingly we obtain the assistance from third party valuation specialists 
the valuations and useful life assumptions are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that are considered reasonable by management 
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill that has an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we amortize the cost of identified intangible assets using amortization methods that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we review for impairment by facts or circumstances  either external or internal  indicating that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value under sfas  which is generally based on the estimated future cash flows 
our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable 
if necessary  we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses loss income from operations interest expense other income  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers that resulted in a million increase in the number of seats under subscription excluding the addition of approximately million surfcontrol seats from december  to december  our revenue also increased compared to as a result of the acquistions of portauthority in january and surfcontrol in october we expect our revenue to increase over revenue levels due to our renewal business and new business  including sales of products acquired from surfcontrol and other expected growth of the smb business  growth of our dlp business and expected growth in international revenue  partially offset by increased distributor marketing payments and channel payments  which are recorded as reductions to revenue 
until sufficient existing subscriptions for the installed surfcontrol customer base are subsequently renewed  revenue contributed by the surfcontrol products will be minimal 
we are also impacted by the write off of the pre acquisition surfcontrol deferred revenue explained earlier 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of the costs of content review  technical support  infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases and costs associated with providing our hosted security services 
cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to million of amortization of acquired technology which resulted from the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january  as well as increased costs for additional personnel in our technical support and database groups  including the increase in headcount attributable to the acquisition of surfcontrol and the addition of dlp products  and allocated costs 
our headcount in cost of revenue departments increased from at december  to at december  the acquired technology is being amortized over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to incur million in amortization expense of acquired technology in due to the full year of amortization of the surfcontrol and portauthority intangible assets 
in addition  we expect cost of revenue to increase to support the growth and maintenance of our databases and costs associated with providing our hosted security services as well as the technical support needs of our customers 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to during from in we expect that cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  will increase for gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to the increased costs described in the preceding cost of revenue section 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will remain in excess of of revenue for operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  including costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel  amortization of acquired customer relationships as well as allocated costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of the increase was due to the amortization of acquired intangibles primarily customer relationships which resulted from the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january the acquired customer relationships intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in addition to the amortization of acquired intangibles  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to additional expenses associated with our new channel strategy started in  increased personnel costs and related travel  including new personnel added from the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions and allocated costs 
our headcount in sales and marketing increased from employees at december  to employees at december  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in due to having a full year of amortization of acquired intangibles  having a full year of additional sales and marketing personnel from surfcontrol to support our expanding selling and marketing efforts worldwide  and increased sales resulting in higher overall sales commission expenses 
we expect amortization of acquired intangibles of million in due to the full year of amortization of acquired intagibles from the surfcontrol and portauthority acquisitions 
we also expect to achieve cost savings as compared to the historical surfcontrol selling and marketing expense  primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel cost  including costs of adding new full time employees due to the portauthority and surfcontrol acquisitions  and increased hiring to support our expanding list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise  the development of websense express and enhancements to additional products  and allocated costs 
our headcount increased in research and development from employees at december  to employees at december  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in due to having a full year of additional engineering personnel from surfcontrol  and the hiring of personnel to support our continued enhancements of our existing and new products 
we are managing the increase in our absolute research and development expense by operating research and development facilities in multiple international locations  including beijing  china  that have lower costs than our operations in the united states 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will decrease in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel needed to support our growing operations  including the acquisitions of portauthority and surfcontrol  and allocated costs 
our headcount increased in general and administrative departments from at december  to at december  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in due to having a full year of additional personnel from surfcontrol and to support growth in operations and expansion of our international operations 
we do not expect to incur the historical surfcontrol general and administrative expense levels due to the elimination of the executive officers of surfcontrol and other personnel  elimination of certain facilities  and elimination of expenses relating to surfcontrol being a public uk company listed on the london stock exchange 
in process research and development 
in process research and development represents the fair value of an acquired  to be completed research project obtained from the portauthority acquisition that had not reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date and is not expected to have an alternative future use 
accordingly  the million of in process research and development was charged to our consolidated statement of operations during there were no in process research and development charges associated with the surfcontrol acquisition 
interest expense interest expense represents the interest incurred on our senior secured credit facility that we utilized to pay for a portion of the surfcontrol purchase price in october also included in the interest expense is  of amortization of deferred financing fees that were capitalized as part of the senior secured credit facility 
interest expense will increase in due to the full year of interest under the senior secured credit facility and amortization of deferred financing fees 
the amount of interest expense will fluctuate due to changes in libor and potential changes in our applicable spread to libor based upon improvements in our leverage ratio in accordance with our senior secured credit facility 
other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to reduced cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from which we generate interest income as a result of our use of an aggregate of million to fund the acquisitions of surfcontrol in october and portauthority in january and related transaction costs 
this decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was partially offset by higher interest rates realized on our balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during as compared with the majority of our investments of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are tax exempt 
we expect that the majority of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will continue to be held in tax exempt investments during the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from our operations but we do not expect to maintain the same level of cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as we maintained prior to our acquisitions of portauthority and surfcontrol  which will reduce our net other income from levels 
provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the decrease in the tax rate was primarily the result of the following factors 
related to the acquisition of surfcontrol  we recorded certain post acquisition net operating losses related to surfcontrol s us operations for which no tax benefit is currently recorded due to the uncertainty of future utilization of these losses 
related to the acquisition of portauthority  we expensed acquired in process research and development in our current year net loss for which a tax deduction is not allowed 
in addition  although the share based compensation for which no tax benefit is recorded in and our state income tax provision are both comparable to prior year s amounts  the impact of these items on the effective tax rate percentage is greater due to the relative size of the pre tax loss of million in compared to the pre tax income of million in our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations  the magnitude of our tax exempt income  any future acquisitions and any future changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules 
years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers that resulted in a million increase in the number of seats under subscription from december  to december  approximately of subscription revenue recognized in and was derived from renewal business 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas r on january   as well as additional personnel in our technical support and database groups and allocated costs 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to during from in gross margin gross margin increased to million in from million in the increase was due to increased revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to in from in operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million was primarily due to share based compensation expenses relating to our adoption of sfas r on january   as well as additional expenses associated with our new channel strategy  increased personnel costs and related travel  and allocated costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily due to share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas r on january   as well as increased personnel needed to support our expanding list of technology partners  the enhancements of websense enterprise and additional products  and allocated costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of share based compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas r on january   as well as additional personnel needed to support our growing operations  and allocated costs 
other income  net net other income increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates realized on our increased balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during compared with provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the increase in the tax rate is primarily related to an increase in the provision for state income taxes and the impact of sfas r on stock compensation that does not result in a tax deduction 
the increase in tax rate is partially offset by an increase in tax exempt income 
recent accounting pronouncements in september the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and thus we will adopt sfas as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our future consolidated financial statements 
in february the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we may consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable securities of million  and retained earnings of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments in marketable securities of million and retained earnings of million 
during  we used our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily to fund million of the acquisition costs of surfcontrol and portauthority  to pay down million of the outstanding balance of our senior secured credit facility and to make  severance and other nonrecurring restructuring payments relating to the surfcontrol acquisition and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to the net loss recorded in compared to net income in and the net change in the operating assets and liabilities  offset by the non cash items for depreciation  amortization  share based compensation and deferred income taxes 
the net loss in  excluding the non cash items described above  was driven by our investments in our two tier channel strategy  international operations and expanded product offerings 
the growth in deferred revenue subscription amounts in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue in compared to helped offset some of the reduced cash flow from operations 
our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by subscription renewals  accounts receivable collections and deferred revenue 
a decrease in subscription renewals or accounts receivable collections  or a lower deferred revenue balance  will negatively impact our operating cash flow 
we expect to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in the million increase in net cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to the net cash paid for the acquisitions of portauthority and surfcontrol totaling approximately million and offset by the net of fewer purchases and more maturities of marketable securities as we were preparing for the acquisitions made in net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared with net cash used in financing activities of million in the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the net borrowing from the senior secured credit facility used to partially pay for the surfcontrol acquisition in there were also no share repurchases during compared to million made during these increases were partially offset by a reduction of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options in and the repayment of the portauthority loan as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
on october   in order to finance a portion of the purchase price for surfcontrol  we entered into an amended and restated senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement 
the million senior secured credit facility consists of a five year million senior secured credit facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility was fully funded on october   and the revolving line of credit remains unused 
on december  we made an optional prepayment under our senior secured credit facility  reducing the outstanding balance to million 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including pledges of stock of some of our subsidiaries subject to limitations in the case of foreign subsidiaries and by secured guarantees by our domestic subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility amortizes at a minimum rate of    and  respectively  during the first four years of the term and during the fifth year 
in conjunction with our million prepayment on december   we amended our senior credit agreement to eliminate any additional mandatory principal payments until september  the initial interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus basis points at december   and is subject to step downs in the spread over libor based upon potential future improvements in our total leverage ratio 
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility requires a basis points fee per annum 
the senior credit agreement contains financial covenants  including a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio  as well as affirmative and negative covenants 
we did not borrow any amounts under the original interim credit facility which was entered into on april  and which was terminated by its terms when the senior credit agreement was executed 
the senior credit agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured credit facility is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years 
on october  in conjunction with the funding of the senior secured credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and receive a floating rate interest payment based on three month libor on an equivalent amount 
the initial principal amount of the swap agreement was million on october  in addition  on october  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate on a portion of our senior secured credit facility to per annum 
the amount of principal protected by this agreement increases from million at december  to million on june  both the interest rate swap and cap expire on september  obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment obligation by year thereafter total senior secured credit facility    operating leases      facility exit obligations     severance obligations   litigation settlement payment  software license total       senior secured credit facility obligations represent the future minimum principal debt payments due under the senior secured credit facility 
on january   we made a voluntary pre payment of million on our senior secured credit facility 
in addition to the amounts listed in the above table  we also have interest payment and fee obligations related to the senior secured credit facility as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through approximately one half of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease  which extends through december our corporate headquarters lease includes escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
facility exit obligations represent estimated future lease and operating costs from facilities acquired from surfcontrol that are being exited as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
severance obligations represent the estimated future severance payments in connection with the surfcontrol employees who were or will be terminated as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
litigation settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with the final settlement for a class action lawsuit as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements 
software license obligations represent purchase commitments for software licenses made in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits as more fully described in note to the audited financial statements have been excluded from the contractual payment obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
share repurchase program 
on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
on august   we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
on july   we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions  but we must also comply with certain restrictions on share repurchases contained in our senior secured credit facility 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
during  we did not repurchase any shares under this program due to the acquisitions of portauthority and surfcontrol 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  investments in marketable securities  revolving credit balances and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including our capital expenditures  debt repayment obligations and stock repurchases  if any  for at least the next months 
in january  we used approximately million of our cash to acquire portauthority which included the repayment of million of portauthority indebtedness  and in october we used approximately million of our cash to acquire surfcontrol 
in december and january  we made voluntary pre payments on our senior secured credit facility of million and million  respectively 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to raise funds for these purposes through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating and capital requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
summarized quarterly data unaudited the following tables present our unaudited quarterly financial data

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and senior secured credit facility 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments such as municipal bonds  government agency obligations  and corporate bonds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and the interest expense incurred on our senior secured credit facility and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments and from our borrowings under our variable rate senior secured credit facility used in connection with the acquisition of surfcontrol in october our senior secured credit facility agreement provides that we must maintain hedge agreements so that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured credit facility is subject to fixed interest rate protection for a period of not less than years 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would materially affect our interest expense 
however  the impact of this type of adverse movement would be partially mitigated by our interest rate swap and cap agreements 
based on our outstanding senior secured credit facility balance at december  and taking into consideration our interest rate swap and cap  our interest expense would increase by approximately  during if there were a hypothetical basis point adverse move in the interest rate yield curve 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive investments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
we bill certain international customers in euros and british pounds and surfcontrol has historically billed certain international customers in euros  british pounds  australian dollars  china yuan renminbi  singapore dollars  japanese yen and israel new shekels 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
notional and fair values of our hedging positions at december  and are presented in the table below in thousands december  december  notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd notional value local currency notional value usd fair value usd euro       british pound    total     the approximate million notional increase in our euro hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily due to the increase in euro billings during all of the euro hedging contracts will be settled before march  for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the euro 
we do not expect euro billings to represent more than of our total billings during the approximate million notional decrease in our british pound hedged position at december  compared to december  is primarily due to the natural hedge against our british pound expenditures by billings in the british pound which began in may as of december  no british pound contracts were outstanding 
we do not expect to hedge the british pound as we continue billing in the british pound which  because we have substantial operations in the uk and expenses in british pounds  creates a natural hedge against our billings in british pounds 
given our foreign exchange position  a change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures
