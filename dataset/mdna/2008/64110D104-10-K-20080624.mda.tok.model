risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
please see page of this annual report on form k for additional discussion of these forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate  which could adversely impact our common stock price 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include  but are not limited to  the following changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the computer  storage  and networking industries  general decrease in global corporate spending on information technology leading to a decline in demand for our products  a shift in federal government spending patterns  the possible effects of terrorist activity and international conflicts  which could lead to business interruptions and difficulty in forecasting  the level of competition in our target product markets  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers due to industry consolidation  which could subject us to periodic supply and demand  price rigidity  and quality issues with our components  the size  timing and cancellation of significant orders  product configuration and mix  the extent to which our customers renew their service and maintenance contracts with us  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  announcements and introductions of  and transitions to  new products by us or our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements introduced by us or our competitors  
table of contents changes in our pricing in response to competitive pricing actions  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and enhancements in a timely manner  supply constraints  technological changes in our target product markets  the levels of expenditure on research and development and sales and marketing programs  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  excess or inadequate facilities  disruptions resulting from new systems and processes as we continue to enhance and adapt our system infrastructure to accommodate future growth  future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies and estimates  and seasonality  for example  as the size of our business has grown  we have begun to see a seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
sales to the us government also tend to be stronger during our second fiscal quarter  concurrent with the end of the us federal government s fiscal year end in september 
in addition  sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be different from what we forecast 
we manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands 
products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order 
in certain circumstances  customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty 
product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving  and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 
we derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter 
bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter 
if we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets  our financial results will be adversely impacted 
if revenues do not meet our expectations  our operating profit may be negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if our revenues are lower than expected  our fixed expenses could adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with revenues 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease 
we cannot assure you that our oem relationship with ibm will generate significant revenue 
in april  we announced a strategic partner relationship with ibm 
as part of the relationship  we entered into an oem agreement that enables ibm to sell ibm branded solutions based on netapp unified solutions  including nearstore and the v series systems  as well as associated software offerings 
while this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries  we do not have an exclusive relationship with ibm  and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time  therefore  we cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in future years 
in addition  we have no control over the products that ibm selects to sell  or its release schedule and timing of those products  nor do we control its pricing 
in the event that sales through ibm increase  we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and ibm or among our channel partners 
if we fail to minimize channel conflicts  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that this oem relationship will generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners  our revenue may be impacted negatively 
an element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major third party software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also co market our products with these vendors 
we have significant partner relationships with database  business application  backup management and server virtualization companies  including microsoft  oracle  sap  symantec and vmware 
a number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market 
there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners  and even if we can establish relationships with these partners  we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time 
we intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships  our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively 
in addition  the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing resellers and attract new resellers and that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships 
in addition  we do not have exclusive relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as value added resellers  systems integrators  distributors  oems  and strategic business partners  and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners 
in fiscal  our indirect channels accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
in order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and maintain or increase our revenue  we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners 
to do so  we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products 
however  because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force  on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers  competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners 
at the same time  our indirect channel partners may offer products that are competitive to ours 
in addition  because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies  including products of our competitors  these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing  sales  and support of our competitors products than ours 
if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners needs with respect to our products  we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue  which would have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively  or if our resellers financial condition or operations weaken  our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 
the us government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us 
future revenue from the us government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns 
a decrease in government demand for our products  or an adverse outcome in an ongoing investigation by the gsa and the department of justice  could materially affect our growth and result in civil penalties and a loss of revenues 
the us government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us  however  government demand is unpredictable  and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from the us government 
government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in it spending 
if the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern  our financial results may be harmed 

table of contents selling our products to the us government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements 
we received a subpoena from the office of inspector general for the general services administration gsa seeking various records relating to gsa contracting activity by us during the period beginning in and ending in the subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by gsa and the department of justice regarding potential violations of the false claims act in connection with our gsa contracting activity 
the subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its gsa contracts 
we are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the department of justice on several occasions 
violations of the false claims act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties  and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting  any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future 
the market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include but are not limited to fluctuations in our operating results  variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement or other regulatory bodies  economic developments in the storage and data management market as a whole  international conflicts and acts of terrorism  announcements of new products  applications or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in our relationships with our suppliers  customers and channel and strategic partners  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies 
additionally  certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates  the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on it could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future  and any broad market decline  as well as our own operating results  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
macroeconomic conditions and an it spending slowdown as well as variations in our expected operating performance may continue to cause volatility in our stock price 
we are unable to predict changes in general economic conditions and whether or to what extent global it spending rates will be affected 
furthermore  if there are future reductions in either domestic or international it spending rates  or if it spending rates do not increase  our revenues  operating results  and stock price may continue to be adversely affected 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
our revenues are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into 
table of contents contracts varies from customer to customer  can be difficult to estimate  and requires management judgment 
small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in it spending  weak general economic conditions or evolving technology can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as our customers purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount  or cancelled 
in addition  we apply the provisions of statement of position and related interpretations to our product sales  both hardware and software  because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware 
if we are unable to establish fair value for undelivered elements of a customer order  revenue relating to the entire order may be deferred until the revenue recognition criteria for all elements of the customer order are met 
this could lower our net revenue in one period and increase it in future periods  resulting in greater variability in net revenue and income both on a period to period basis and on an actual versus forecast basis 
if we are unable to successfully implement our global brand awareness campaign  we may not be able to increase our customer base  market share  or revenue  and our operating results will be adversely affected 
we believe that building our global brand awareness is a key factor to the long term success of our business and will be crucial in order for us to grow our customer base  increase our market share  and accelerate our revenue growth 
in order to increase this awareness  we launched a new branding campaign in march  which includes a new company name  logo  tagline and new corporate messaging 
we are also increasing our sales headcount in order to leverage our brand awareness campaign and build demand for our products with both new and existing customers 
we are currently incurring  and will continue to incur  significant expenses as a result of these investments 
if we are not successful in achieving our desired growth in revenue  customers  demand and market share  whether on the time line we have forecasted or at all  our operating results will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change  if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products  or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products 
due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products  such products are subject to significant technical risks 
in addition  our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if such products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  new or additional product introductions may also adversely affect our sales of existing products  which could also materially and adversely affect our operating results 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers demands 
as we enter new or emerging markets  we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition 
we may not be able to provide products  service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
furthermore  provision of greater levels of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition due to the provisions of statement of position no 
and related interpretations 
our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product and service solutions  and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems  and the resale market for disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures 
our sales of disk 
table of contents drives generate lower gross margin than those of our storage systems 
as a result  as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content  overall gross margin may be negatively affected 
our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors  including demand for storage and data management products  pricing actions  rebates  initiatives  discount levels and price competition  direct versus indirect and oem sales  product and add on software mix  the mix of services as a percentage of revenue  the mix and average selling prices of products  the mix of disk content  new product introductions and enhancements  excess inventory purchase commitments as a result of changes in demand forecasts and possible product and software defects as we transition our products  and the cost of components  manufacturing labor  quality  warranty and freight 
changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as continued investments in our customer support infrastructure  changes in the mix between technical support services and professional services  and the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 
an increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
the storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology 
in the storage market  our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from emc  hds  hp  ibm  and sun storagetek 
we also see dell  inc as a competitor in the storage marketplace  primarily through its business partnership with emc  which allows dell to resell emc storage hardware and software products 
we have also historically encountered less frequent competition from other companies  including lsi logic 
in the secondary storage market  which includes the disk to disk backup  compliance  and business continuity segments  our solutions compete primarily against products from emc and sun storagetek 
our nearstore vtl appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backup recovery space 
additionally  a number of small  new companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets and the near line and nearstore vtl storage markets  some of which may become significant competitors in the future 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents we rely on a limited number of suppliers  and any disruption or termination of our supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives  computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products 
in recent years  rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers  which could subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  supplier capacity constraints  price increases  timely delivery  and component quality 
component quality risk is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives 
in order to meet product performance requirements  we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity 
in addition  there are periodic supply and demand issues for disk drives  microprocessors and semiconductor memory components  which could result in component shortages  selective supply allocations and increased prices of such components 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase 
in addition  problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur 
disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers 
in addition  we license certain technology and software from third parties that are incorporated into our products 
if we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner 
the loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
we currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture our products in multiple locations around the world 
our reliance on our third party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process  exposing us to risks  including reduced control over quality assurance  production costs and product supply 
if we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  or if our contract manufacturers experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired  and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required to change contract manufacturers or bring certain manufacturing in house  we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties  which could adversely impact our operating results 
to date  we do not have any significant purchase commitments under our agreements with contract manufacturers 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we may need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or their inability to obtain raw materials suitable for our needs could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 

table of contents our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets 
if these markets do not continue to grow at the rates we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our growth  our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted 
all of our products address the storage and data management markets 
accordingly  our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets 
we cannot assure you that the markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of unix  windows and the world wide web server markets upon which we depend 
for example  we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services  healthcare  pharmaceutical and government market segments  industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access  reliability and permanence such as rule a of the securities exchange act of  as amended in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate 
if our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard  customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products  and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates  impairment of our investments could harm our financial results 
at april   and april   we had  million and  million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash and investments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in corporate bonds  money market funds  corporate securities  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies  and auction rate securities 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the sub prime mortgage crisis in the united states which has affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues 
if the global credit market continues to deteriorate  our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value  requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted investments are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
because we have the ability and intent to hold our available for sale investments until maturity  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
however  we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
currently  we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure 
funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for in excess of months and our auction rate securities may experience an other than temporary decline in value  which would adversely affect our earnings 
auction rate securities or  ars  held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities which  in accordance with investment policy guidelines  had credit ratings of aaa and aaa at time of purchase 
interest rates for ars are reset through a dutch auction each month  which historically has provided a liquid market for these securities 
substantially all of our ars are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education  and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee 
however liquidity 
table of contents issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ars investments  with a par value of million at april  for each failed auction  the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security  and the ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms  although the principal associated with the ars will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ars investments develop 
we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ars investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments 
based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments  we recorded a temporary impairment within other accumulated comprehensive income  an element of stockholders equity on our balance sheet  of approximately million at april  in addition  we have classified all of our auction rate securities that were not liquidated before april  as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of april  as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
if liquidity issues in the global credit market continue  or worsen  or if we experience reduced credit quality  extended illiquidity or realize reduced valuations of our ars investments  we may determine that we have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value in these long term assets  which could adversely impact our financial results 
our leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our sale of billion of convertible senior notes in june the notes  we have a greater amount of long term debt than we have maintained in the past 
we also have two credit facilities and various synthetic lease arrangements 
as of april   as adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the notes as of such date  we would have had approximately billion of long term debt outstanding 
in addition  subject to the restrictions in our existing and any future financings agreements  we may incur additional debt 
our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have important consequences because it could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations  an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions and governmental regulations 
our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt 
if we fail to make a payment on our debt  we could be in default on such debt  and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding classes of debt 
future issuances of common stock and hedging activities by holders of the notes may depress the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
any issuance of equity securities after the notes offering  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  including holders who receive shares upon conversion of their notes  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy including in connection with acquisitions  strategic collaborations or other transactions  to increase our capital  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 

table of contents in addition  the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes 
the hedging or arbitrage could  in turn  affect the trading price of the notes  or any common stock that holders receive upon conversion of the notes 
conversion of our notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders  including holders who had previously converted their notes 
the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver common stock upon conversion of the notes 
upon conversion  we will satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash for the principal amount of a note and shares of common stock  if any  to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount 
there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the notes as that portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash 
the number of shares delivered upon conversion  if any  will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share 
any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions  or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
the note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the sale of the notes may affect the trading price of our common stock 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties the counterparties  which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the notes 
at the same time  we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock above a certain strike price 
in connection with hedging these transactions  the counterparties may have entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or purchased shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions at or following the pricing of the notes 
such activities may have had the effect of increasing the price of our common stock 
the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock or entering into other derivative transactions 
additionally  these transactions may expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards and the diversification of counterparties 
the effect  if any  of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend  in part  on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition  if our stock price exceeds the strike price for the warrants  there could be additional dilution to our shareholders  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our synthetic leases are off balance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
we are investing substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure  which will increase our fixed costs 
our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs 
we have various synthetic lease arrangements with bnp paribas leasing corporation the lessor for our headquarters office buildings in sunnyvale  california and a data center in research triangle park  north carolina 
these synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases as amended  and are not considered variable interest entities under fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities revised 
therefore  we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
however  if circumstances were to change regarding our or bnp s ownership of the properties  or in bnp s overall portfolio  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facilities and the associated debt 

table of contents if we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to bnp 
therefore  if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value  our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to bnp  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
we have contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our facilities and data center 
we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities 
these expansions will increase our fixed costs 
if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs  our profitability will be reduced 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants pursuant to our indebtedness 
these covenants may restrict our ability to finance our business and  if we do not comply with the covenants or otherwise default under them  we may not have the funds necessary to pay all amounts that could become due 
the agreements governing our credit facilities and synthetic lease arrangements contain  and any other future debt agreement we enter into may contain  covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level  grant liens  sell all or substantially all our assets enter into certain mergers  change our business  enter into swap agreements  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the notes and our other debt  which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
unfavorable economic and market conditions and global disruptions could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions as well as the uncertain geopolitical environment 
customer demand for our products is intrinsically linked to the strength of the economy 
a reduction in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening economic conditions and customer decreases in corporate spending  deferral or delay of it projects  longer time frames for it purchasing decisions and generally reduced capital expenditures for it storage solutions will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates for us 
the network storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal through fiscal  causing both our revenues and operating results to decline 
if the storage and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated  or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world  including terrorist activities and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
we have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in either the us or other regions of the world 
continued increases in energy prices  declining economic conditions and global credit and liquidity issues could also affect our future operating results 
if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if they deteriorate  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the us for example  in fiscal  of our total revenues were from international customers including us exports 
in addition  we have several research and development centers overseas  and a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the us accordingly  our business and our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations  some of which are beyond our control  including regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  government spending patterns  and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve  and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
our international sales are denominated in us dollars and in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
conversely  lowering our price in local currency may result in lower us based revenue 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local operating expenses 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
we utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
all balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter 
the time value component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur  at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings 
these hedges attempt to reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market 
there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include  among others  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations 
such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results 
our international operations are subject to other risks  including general import export restrictions and the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us law 
a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances are held overseas 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash domestically in order to fund our us operations and strategic opportunities and service our debt  we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances  or we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
a portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
these amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the united states without triggering significant adverse tax consequences  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as a result  unless the cash generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our domestic operations  our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases  acquisitions  and other strategic opportunities  and to 
table of contents service our outstanding indebtedness  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or we may need to expand our existing credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash 
such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders ownership 
furthermore  lenders  in particular in light of the current challenges in the credit markets  may not agree to extend us new  additional or continuing credit 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities  develop new products  respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness 
in any such case  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the us statutory tax rate  material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as a result of a shift in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction  our ability to use tax credits  or effective tax rates by tax jurisdiction different than our estimates  changing tax laws  accounting standards  such as occurred with the introduction of sfas no 
r and fin no 
 regulations  and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including certain stock based compensation expense  write offs of acquired in process research and development  and impairment of goodwill  the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  tax assessments or any related tax interest or penalties could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place  and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the united states and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the netherlands  which expires in if we are unable to renegotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling  our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected 
our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations  which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the united states and several foreign tax jurisdictions 
the rights to some of our intellectual property ip are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and payments are made between us and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this ip in a qualified cost sharing arrangement 
recently  several other us companies have had their foreign ip arrangements challenged as part of irs examinations  which has resulted in material proposed assessments and or pending litigation 
our management does not believe  based upon information currently known to us  that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial 
table of contents position and our results of operations and cash flows 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future acquisitions and investments in nonmarketable securities of private companies  and these investments may not achieve our objectives 
as part of our strategy  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  or enhance our technical capabilities 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders investments and cause us to use cash  incur debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks  and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value 
integration risks and issues may include  but are not limited to  key personnel retention and assimilation  management distraction  technical development and unexpected costs and liabilities  including goodwill impairment charges 
in addition  we may be unable to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on occasion  we invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies 
as of april   the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled million 
investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky  and some of these companies are likely to fail 
their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on these companies future prospects  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed  or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and our investments in them would likely become impaired 
if we fail to manage our expanding business effectively  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our future operating results depend to a large extent on management s ability to successfully manage expansion and growth  including but not limited to expanding international operations  forecasting revenues  addressing new markets  controlling expenses  implementing and enhancing infrastructure  investing in people  facilities and capital equipment and managing our assets 
an unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  continued expansion could strain our current management  financial  manufacturing and other existing systems and may require us to improve those existing systems or implement new ones 
if we experience any problems with the improvement or expansion of these systems  procedures or controls  or if these systems  procedures or controls are not designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner  our operations may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 
as we continue to grow our business  we are likely to incur costs earlier than some of the anticipated benefits  which could harm our operating results 
a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed  which could materially and adversely affect our net income 
we are increasing our investment in engineering  sales  service support and other functions to grow our business 
we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits  and the return on these investments may be lower  or may develop more slowly  than we expect  which could harm our business 

table of contents our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales  and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed 
as a result  if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels  net income will be affected in a material and adverse manner 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic events 
any political  military  world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure or other material disruption caused by fire  floods  hurricanes  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our headquarters are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
if any significant disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be impaired 
we depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain such personnel  our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
competition for qualified engineers  particularly in silicon valley  can be intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
undetected software errors  hardware errors  or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and net income 
our products may contain undetected software errors  hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we fail to remedy a product defect  we may experience a failure of a product line  temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market  damage to our reputation  inventory costs or product reengineering expenses  any of which could have a material impact on our revenue  margins and net income 
in addition  we may be subject to losses that may result or are alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
based on our historical experience  we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low 
however  should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims  our business could be adversely impacted 
we are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business  including our ongoing litigation with sun microsystems 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret  copyright and patent laws  which afford only limited protection 
some of our us trademarks are registered internationally as well 
we will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers  strategic partners and customers 
we currently have multiple us and international patent applications pending and multiple us patents issued 
the pending applications may not be approved  and our existing and future patents may be challenged 
if such challenges are brought  the patents may be invalidated 
we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business 
in addition  a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
any such litigation may be time consuming and costly 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims 
we may  from time to time  receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products  patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
we expect that companies in the network storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec  and nasdaq  have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended april  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of although our assessment  testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of april   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our business and reputation could be harmed 
we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations  either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income 
because new and modified laws  regulations  and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by 
table of contents regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 
our ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new and existing accounting requirements such as sfas no 
r 
the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other share based payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of income 
option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  expected life and forfeiture rate 
we have chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to purchase our common stock as permitted by sab no 
management applies judgment when determining estimated forfeiture rates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and  as a result  could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
given the unpredictable nature of the black scholes variables and other management assumptions such as number of options to be granted  underlying strike price and associated income tax impacts  it is very difficult to forecast stock based compensation expense for any given quarter or year 
any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact our ability to make accurate forecasts of future earnings and volatility of our stock price 
if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated  securities class action litigation could be brought against us  or the market price of our common stock could decline  or both could occur 
as a result  we could incur significant losses  and our operating results may be adversely affected
