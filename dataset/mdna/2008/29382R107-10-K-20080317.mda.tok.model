item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television and radio assets that reach hispanic consumers across the united states  as well as the border markets of mexico 
we operate in two reportable segments television broadcasting and radio broadcasting 
additionally  as of december   our outdoor advertising assets are classified as held for sale 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and or operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising operations consist of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
as of december   our outdoor advertising assets are presented as held for sale 
the comparability of our results between and is significantly affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
highlights during  we faced difficult comparisons due to the absence of certain major events  such as world cup and political activity that occurred in in addition  we were confronted with a weak advertising environment  both in television and radio 
nevertheless  we continued to build our audience shares  drive operating efficiencies and control costs 
our television segment generated million in net revenue in we sustained solid ratings across this segment  and advertising rates continued to be solid 
our television results were driven by continued growth in our top advertising categories  including automotive  fast food restaurants  telecommunications and retail 
we 
table of contents continued to enjoy significant revenue growth from certain of our television stations located in markets with rapidly growing hispanic populations 
notwithstanding the net revenue growth of these particular stations  net revenue for our television segment as a whole decreased by million or for from million for this decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in national advertising sales  primarily as a result of difficult revenue comparisons due to significant non recurring events that occurred during  such as world cup and political activity 
our radio segment contributed million in net revenue in as we concentrated our efforts on local sales  which accounted for of total radio segment sales in our radio results were driven by continued growth in our top advertising categories  including automotive  travel and leisure  services and telecommunications 
our radio results were partly due to revenue growth from our radio stations where we added our third network format  jos toca lo que quiere plays what he wants  which features a mix of spanish language adult contemporary and mexican regional hits from the s through the present  as well as our stations that began broadcasting the piolin por la ma ana  syndicated morning show  one of the highest rated spanish language radio programs in the country  and have seen solid ratings growth in all of these markets 
notwithstanding the net revenue growth of these particular stations  net revenue for our radio segment as a whole decreased by million or for from million for the decrease in net revenue would have been lower but for the loss of net revenue from our radio stations serving the tucson and dallas markets  which we sold in the third quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the decrease in net revenue was also partly due to difficult comparisons from  where we benefited from world cup and political advertising revenue 
in december  we began operating wnue fm  serving the orlando  florida market  as part of our pending acquisition of this station that we expect to complete in the first quarter of with the addition of wnue fm  orlando will become our th market in which we own both radio and television assets 
acquisitions and dispositions in april  we acquired a full power television construction permit colorado springs  colorado for million in an auction held by the fcc 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs  outputs and processes from this acquisition and determined that the items excluded were significant and that this acquisition was not considered a business 
in a strategic effort to focus our resources on strengthening existing clusters and expanding into new us hispanic markets  we regularly review our portfolio of media properties and seek to divest non core assets in markets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out clusters 
in accordance with this strategy  we are currently in the process of selling our outdoor advertising operations 
in february  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our outdoor operations to lamar advertising co 
for million in cash 
the sale is expected to close in the second quarter of upon the consummation of the transaction  the company will no longer have outdoor operations 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect the outdoor segment as discontinued operations  we have presented the related assets and liabilities as assets held for sale and reclassified the related revenue and expenses as discontinued operations

as of december   univision owned approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis 
in connection with its merger with hispanic broadcasting corporation in september  univision entered into an agreement with the us department of justice  or doj  pursuant to which univision agreed  among other things  to ensure that its percentage ownership of our company would not exceed by march  and will not exceed by march  in january  we sold the assets of radio stations kbrg fm and 
table of contents klok am  serving the san francisco san jose  california market  to univision for million 
univision paid the full amount of the purchase price in the form of approximately million shares of our class u common stock held by univision 
subsequently  in  we repurchased million shares of our class u common stock held by univision for million 
in february  we repurchased an additional  shares of class u common stock held by univision for million 
univision is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock 
the class u common stock has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors 
however  as the holder of all of our issued and outstanding class u common stock  univision currently has the right to approve any merger  consolidation or other business combination involving our company  any dissolution of our company and any assignment of the federal communications commission  or fcc  licenses for any of our company s univision affiliated television stations

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and loss gain on sale of assets 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following unaudited  in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio consolidated direct operating expenses television radio consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio consolidated segment operating profit television radio consolidated corporate expenses gain on sale of assets impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio consolidated total assets television radio outdoor assets held for sale consolidated footnotes on next page 
table of contents percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means net income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full year 
the actual maximum net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to   to  to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our new syndicated bank credit facility in september  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
amounts represent outdoor assets classified as assets held for sale 
amounts represent radio assets classified as held for sale 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cash flows from operating activities follows in thousands years ended december  consolidated adjusted ebitda interest expense interest income loss on debt extinguishment income tax expense benefit amortization of syndication contracts payments on syndication contracts gain on sale of assets non cash expense included in corporate expenses non cash stock based compensation included in direct operating expenses non cash stock based compensation included in selling  general and administrative expenses non cash stock based compensation included in corporate expenses depreciation and amortization impairment charge carrying value adjustment in discontinued operations reclassified items in discontinued operations equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates net loss depreciation and amortization impairment charge deferred income taxes amortization of debt issue costs amortization of syndication contracts payments on syndication contracts equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate non cash stock based compensation gain on sale of media properties and other assets loss on debt extinguishment change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements changes in assets and liabilities  net of effect of acquisitions and dispositions increase decrease in accounts receivable increase decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets increase decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities effect of discontinued operations cash flows from operating activities footnotes on preceding page year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated operations net revenue

we are authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we intend to finance stock repurchases  if and when made  with available cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
on october   our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our class a common stock that were repurchased by the company 
consolidated adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined below decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated adjusted ebitda increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that  on a long term basis  consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase in future periods as we believe that net revenue increases will outpace increases in direct operating  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means operating income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include non cash stock based compensation  non cash corporate expense  non cash impairment loss  loss gain on sale of assets  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum net debt ratio  senior debt ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum net debt ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt minus cash  up to a maximum of million  to consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum net debt ratio may not exceed to on a pro forma basis for the prior full year 
the actual maximum net debt ratios were as follows in each case as of december  to   to  to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our current syndicated bank credit facility in september  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
the maximum net debt ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and 
table of contents financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment loss  non cash stock based compensation awards  non cash corporate expense  net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss was primarily a result of non cash expenses  including a carrying value adjustment charge in discontinued operations of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss was primarily a result of non cash expenses  including impairment charges of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net loss from continuing operations 
we expect to continue to have positive cash flow from operating activities for the year for the year ended december   net cash flow used in investing activities was million  whereas for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by investing activities was million 
during the year ended december   we spent million on net capital expenditures and the acquisition of a full power television construction permit in colorado springs  colorado 
additionally  we spent million on net capital expenditures in our outdoor advertising operations  which is reported in discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we sold the assets of radio stations in the tucson  arizona market and the dallas  texas market for million 
we spent million on net capital expenditures and acquisition of intangibles and collected million on a note receivable 
we spent million on net capital expenditures in our outdoor advertising operations  which is reported in discontinued operations 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in net cash flow used in financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for million including transaction fees and made net debt payments of million 
we received net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
during the year ended december   we paid million to repurchase million shares of our class u common stock from univision and we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for million including transaction fees

we plan to continue to repurchase our class a common stock from time to time in future periods in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades or private repurchases 
during  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million 
additionally  our digital capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 

table of contents as part of the transition from analog to digital television service  full service television station owners are required  as a result of legislation that went into effect in early  to discontinue broadcasting analog signals and to relinquish one of their paired analog digital channels to the fcc on february  we currently expect the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for our remaining full service television stations  for which we have sought waivers from the fcc  will be approximately million 
in addition  we have elected to continue to broadcast separate digital and analog signals throughout this transition period 
we intend to finance the conversion to digital television by using net cash flow from operations 
also  in order to broadcast high definition programming in the future  we intend to begin construction at our studio control facilities in  and at our production control facilities in we currently expect that the cost of this high definition upgrade at our local studios will be approximately million in  and approximately million in we intend to finance the high definition upgrade by using net cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other broadcast or media opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through net cash flow from operations  borrowings under our syndicated bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets each of our operating segments is a reporting unit 
we assign all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and do not amortize goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses represents all licenses owned and operated within an individual market cluster as such licenses are used together  are complimentary to each other and are representative of the best use of those assets 
our individual market clusters are cities or nearby cities 
we test our broadcasting licenses for impairment based on assumptions about these market clusters 

table of contents assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate annually and when triggering events occur  the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary 
table of contents differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less than months 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contacts directly with the advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments sfas requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the increase in fair value is classified as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
discontinued operations we committed to a plan to sell the outdoor advertising business in the fourth quarter of upon closing of the transaction  we will no longer have outdoor operations 
we decided to sell our outdoor advertising business as the net proceeds of the sale would strengthen our ability to invest in our core television and radio businesses while improving our financial flexibility 
in accordance with sfas  the outdoor advertising business has been presented as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we have reported the results of its operations for all periods presented in discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations 
in the statements of cash flows  the cash flows of discontinued operations have been reclassified for all periods presented and are separately classified within the respective categories with those of continuing operations 

table of contents assets classified as assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and are not depreciated and amortized while classified as held for sale 
fair value of assets held for sale is based on estimates of future cash flows  which may include expected proceeds to be received or the present value of estimated future cash flows 
costs to sell are the direct incremental costs estimated to transact a sale 
a loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent write down to fair value less costs to sell 
a gain is recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell  but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized 
certain amounts in our prior period consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
all discussions and amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated statements for all periods presented relate to continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted

sfas is effective beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on the financial statements 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and 
table of contents indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
television we engaged an independent appraiser  bia financial network bia  experienced in valuing advertising properties to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our television reporting unit in bia determined that the fair value of the television reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately million  which we believed was a significant difference 
our television reporting unit has not changed dramatically since the valuation 
the valuation of the fair value of the television reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models for the reporting unit 
the assumptions in the models were based on the reporting unit s projected ability to generate cash flows in various cities or nearby cities  which we refer to as market clusters  based on signal coverage of the markets and on the reporting unit s actual historical results and expected future cash flows in each market cluster 
in order to corroborate the fair market value estimated by the discounted cash flow analysis  the valuation considered recent comparable sales 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our television reporting unit  the valuation used discounted cash flow models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that our television segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in our television expenses  and therefore our television assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
radio we engaged bia to conduct an appraisal of the fair value of our radio reporting unit in and we recorded an impairment of million principally relating to goodwill and certain fcc licenses in two of our markets 
after recording the impairment  we determined that the fair value of the radio reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately million  which we believed was a significant difference 
we believe that our radio reporting unit has not changed significantly since the valuation 
the valuation of the fair value of the radio reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models for the reporting unit 
the assumptions in the models were based on the reporting unit s projected ability to generate cash flows in various cities or nearby cities  which we refer to as market clusters  based on signal coverage of the markets and on the reporting unit s actual historical results and expected future cash flows in each market cluster

if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
outdoor discontinued operations we committed to a plan to sell the outdoor advertising business in the fourth quarter of as we believed we could receive greater value through a sale as opposed to operating it 
upon closing of the transaction  we will no longer have outdoor operations 
we have reported the results of our outdoor operations in discontinued operations within the statements of operations and cash flows and have classified the assets held for sale within the balance sheet at december  in accordance with the annual fourth quarter assessment of the carrying value of our outdoor advertising business  we determined that its carrying value exceeded its fair value  as a result of a sustained  marginal 
table of contents underperformance of expected operating results and a general slowing of growth in the outdoor business over recent quarters 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the outdoor assets held for sale to fair value less costs to sell 
we estimated the fair value of the outdoor assets held for sale at million  reflecting the expected proceeds to be realized from a potential buyer in a future sale  which we believe is the current market value of these assets 
in february  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our outdoor advertising business to lamar advertising for million 
based on the estimated fair value of our outdoor business  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million to reduce its carrying value to its implied fair value 
we estimated the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the total fair value of the outdoor business to the identifiable assets held for sale  which consist primarily of fixed assets  customer list  and deferred tax asset  with the remaining fair value allocated to goodwill 
after adjusting the fair value of goodwill  the carrying value of the customer list still exceeded the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group 
accordingly  considering the carrying value approximated the fair value of the remaining assets of the disposal group  with the exception of the customer list  we recorded an adjustment to the carrying value of the customer list of million 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into three interest rate swap agreements  and an additional interest rate swap agreement in february  described more fully in item a below 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries or any interests in  or relationships with  any material variable interest entities that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
except for the items discussed above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements are recorded at fair market value and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreement 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
however  as of february  we have four swap arrangements that convert the 
table of contents entire amount of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we would be required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
our current policy prohibits entering into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  as of december   million of our term loan was outstanding 
our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available under the revolving facility for future borrowings 
our syndicated bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in our credit agreement 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  the three interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the one interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that the term loan amounts will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  changes in their fair values are reflected currently in earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified as other liabilities on the balance sheet 
we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   our interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the fair value is classified as other liabilities on our balance sheet and as an increase of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized an increase of million of interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we converted a portion of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  in february  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement  as a result of which we do not expect that our term loan amounts will exceed the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease
