our customers include insurance companies  collision repair facilities  independent assessors and automotive recyclers 
we help our customers estimate the costs to repair damaged vehicles and determine pre collision fair market values for vehicles damaged beyond repair  automate and outsource steps of the claims process that insurance companies have historically performed internally  and improve their ability to monitor and manage their businesses through data reporting and analysis 
as of june   we served over  customers and were active in more than countries with approximately  full time employees 
our customers include more than automobile insurance companies   collision repair facilities   independent assessors and  automotive recyclers 
we derive revenues from many of the world s largest automobile insurance companies  including each of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in europe and at least nine of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in north america 

table of contents the automobile insurance claims process an overview of the automobile insurance claims process and its complexities provides a framework for understanding how our customers can derive value from our software and services 
the automobile insurance claims process generally begins following an automobile collision and consists of the following steps first notice of loss the policyholder initiates the claim process with the insurance company 
the insurance company assigns the claim to an assessor and or a collision repair facility 
investigation the assessor conducts interviews  examines photos and reviews police reports 
the insurance company  assessor or collision repair facility estimates the cost to repair the vehicle 
in the case of a heavily damaged vehicle  the assessor or collision repair facility may request a pre accident vehicle valuation 
evaluation the insurance company reviews the estimate and or pre accident valuation and confirms the results of the investigation 
the insurance company may request additional information and or require follow up investigation 
decision the insurance company determines whether the vehicle should be repaired or declared a total loss 
based on its evaluation  the insurance company determines who is liable for the claim and the repair or total loss amount it intends to pay 
settlement the insurance company notifies the policyholder or the collision repair facility of the amount it intends to pay 
the policyholder or collision repair facility may negotiate the final payment amount with the insurance company 
vehicle repair the collision repair facility repairs the vehicle if it is not a total loss 
the collision repair facility purchases replacement parts from original equipment manufacturers  or oems  aftermarket parts makers or automotive recyclers 
further revisions to the claim payment amount may occur if additional damage or cost savings are identified 
payment the insurance company pays the policyholder or the collision repair facility 
each of these steps consists of multiple actions requiring significant and complex interaction among several parties 
for example  the investigation step generally involves insurance companies  assessors  collision repair facilities and automotive recyclers and includes conducting interviews  taking and examining photographs  obtaining and reviewing police reports and estimating repair costs 
when performed manually  many of these tasks  such as the mailing of vehicle photographs or the estimating of vehicle repair costs  can be time consuming 
in addition  without an efficient means of communication that facilitates real time access to data  claim related negotiations can result in substantial delays and unnecessary costs 

table of contents the automobile insurance claims processing industry the primary participants in the automobile insurance claims processing industry are automobile insurance companies  collision repair facilities  independent assessors and automotive recyclers 
we believe that our business is affected by trends associated with each of the following automobile insurance industry we estimate that the global automobile insurance industry processes more than million claims each year  representing approximately billion in repair costs 
we believe the industry is relatively concentrated with a number of large automobile insurance companies accounting for the majority of global automobile insurance premiums 
in the us  of the approximately companies offering automobile insurance  the twenty five largest providers accounted for over of all automobile insurance premiums in the top european non life insurance companies accounted for of total non life insurance premiums in collision repair industry the collision repair industry is highly fragmented 
we estimate there are approximately  collision repair facilities in our markets 
the operating costs of these facilities have increased substantially over the past decade due to continued increases in vehicle diagnostic and repair technologies and changes in environmental regulations 
in addition  collision repair facilities have increasingly established preferred relationships with insurance companies 
these arrangements  known in the us as direct repair programs  allow collision repair facilities to generate increased repair volumes through insurance company referrals 
insurance companies benefit by establishing a trusted network of collision repair facilities across which they can implement standard procedures and best practices 
insurance companies often require collision repair facilities to use specified automated claims processing software and related services to participate in their programs 
we believe the combination of these factors will increase demand for software and services that help collision repair facilities manage their workflow and increase their efficiency 
independent assessors independent assessors are often used to estimate vehicle repair costs  particularly where automobile insurance companies have chosen not to employ their own assessors or do not have a sufficient number of employee assessors and where governments mandate the use of independent assessors 
in some markets  we believe changing government regulations and improved claims technology will result in a decrease in the number of independent assessors 
however  in other markets  insurance companies are reducing their employee assessor staff to contain costs  which we believe will lead to a growth in the number of independent assessors 
we believe the combination of these offsetting factors will result in a modest overall increase in the number of independent assessors and  therefore  the demand for automobile insurance claims processing software and services 
automotive recycling industry the automotive recycling industry is highly fragmented with over billion in estimated worldwide annual sales by over  independent salvage and recycling facilities 
participants in the automotive recycling industry are a valuable source of economical and often hard to find used vehicle replacement parts 
in addition  this industry has become more sophisticated and technology driven in order to keep pace with innovations in vehicle technology 
additionally  insurance companies are increasingly mandating the use of aftermarket and recycled parts to lower the costs to repair damaged vehicles 
we believe these factors will result in increased demand for automobile insurance claims processing software and services  as automotive recyclers seek to manage their workflows  maximize the value of their inventories and increase efficiency 

table of contents key drivers of automobile insurance claims processing demand we believe that the principal drivers of demand for our software and services are inefficiencies in the automobile insurance claims process claims process fragmentation 
the automobile insurance claims process involves many parties and consists of many steps  which are often managed through paper  fax and other labor intensive processes 
in a june poll conducted by a leading provider of statistical claims data to the property and casualty insurance industry  approximately of us insurance companies identified improving claims handling processes as their most important goal 
key areas for improvement identified by the survey included lowering operating costs  reducing fraud and improving claims handling efficiency 
by simplifying and streamlining the claims process  insurance companies can process claims faster and reduce costs 
unequal access to information 
collision repair facilities typically have more information about vehicles in their shops than do insurance companies who often must make their damage estimates remotely or with limited information 
through access to detailed information about vehicle damage and replacement costs  insurance companies can more accurately estimate fair settlement values and reduce overpayment on claims 
disparate claims data 
claims related data generated by automobile insurance companies often is not stored  shared with other parties or captured in a format that is easily transferable to other applications 
this  combined with the inability to transfer and manipulate data easily across multiple applications  hinders comparisons of repairs and claims 
increased access to data from industry participants generates more accurate repair estimates and allows automobile insurance companies to identify top performing collision repair facilities 
conflicting interests of industry participants 
collision repair facilities benefit from high repair costs  which increase their revenues 
conversely  insurance companies benefit from low repair costs  which reduce their expenses 
this conflict can result in high settlement costs and delays 
repair cost estimates that rely on common data sources can reduce these costs and delays 
inefficient collision repair facility workflow 
many collision repair facilities manage their complex workflows manually or without specialized software 
manual workflow management leads to increased processing time  higher costs and more errors  problems that generally intensify as a facility grows 
with claims processing software and services  collision repair facilities can more effectively manage their workflows and obtain detailed part availability and pricing information 
growth in the automobile insurance claims industry growth in the number of worldwide vehicles 
according to industry sources  from to  the number of personal and commercial vehicles in use has increased an average of per year 
additional growth of to per year is expected through  with forecasted annual growth of in asia pacific countries through as the number of vehicles on the road continues to expand  we believe the need for automobile insurance claims processing products and services will continue to grow to handle increased claims activity 
in some insurance markets  such as north america and western europe  automobile insurance is generally government mandated and automated claims processing is widespread 
automobile insurance companies achieve growth in these highly competitive markets by gaining additional market share  and generally compete on price and quality of policyholder service 
to remain competitive  insurance companies increasingly seek additional automated claims processing products and services to minimize costs and improve policyholder service 
in other markets  such as eastern europe  latin america  china and india  automobile insurance companies are growing primarily due to an increase in the number of vehicles and emerging government regulations that 
table of contents require vehicles to be insured 
many automobile insurance companies in these markets process claims manually  presenting significant opportunities for them to increase their operational efficiencies  by automating claims processing 
adoption of automated claims processing software and services 
many markets have only recently begun to adopt automated claims processing software and services to reduce inefficiencies 
we anticipate that increased adoption of automated claims processing software and services in these markets will be a key driver of our growth 
the cost of automated claims processing software and services generally represents a relatively small portion of automobile insurance companies claims costs 
we believe automobile insurance companies will increase their spending on automated claims processing software and services because incremental investments can result in significant cost reductions 
our software and services our software and services can be organized into five general categories estimating and workflow software  salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  shared services and other 
estimating and workflow software our core offering is our estimating and workflow software 
our estimating and workflow software helps our customers manage the overall claims process  estimate the cost to repair a damaged vehicle  and calculate the pre collision fair market value of a vehicle 
key functions of our estimating and workflow software include capturing first notice of loss information assigning  managing and monitoring claims and claim related events accessing and exchanging claims related information calculating  submitting  tracking and storing repair and total loss estimates reviewing  assessing and reporting estimate variations based upon pre set rules routing shop estimates for manual review scheduling repairs salvage and recycling software our salvage and recycling software helps automotive recyclers manage their inventories in order to facilitate the location  sale and exchange of vehicle parts for use in the repair of a damaged vehicle 
key functions of our salvage and recycling software include managing inventory connecting to collision repair facilities to facilitate the use of recycled parts in the repair of a damaged vehicle locating vehicle parts by price  year  model and or geographic area determining the interchangeability of automobile parts across vehicle models exchanging vehicle parts with other recyclers preparing invoices and managing accounts receivable generating management reports 
table of contents business intelligence and consulting services our business intelligence and consulting services help our insurance company customers monitor and assess their performance through customized data  reports and analyses 
key elements of our business intelligence and consulting services include analyzing claims amounts and payments creating customized statistical reports on claims data and activity measuring our customers performance against industry standards monitoring key performance indicators  such as alternative parts utilization in the repair process and repair cycle time shared services we have developed our shared services to help our insurance company customers outsource claims related tasks 
the key components of our shared services include reviewing repair estimates prepared by collision repair facilities reviewing decisions to repair or replace damaged parts auditing and facilitating settlement of repair prices with collision repair facilities reviewing medical and workers compensation bills communicating with policyholders other we provide additional services and products to our customers  which include selling hardware for use with our software  training  and call center technical support services 
we also offer services that allow our customers to access operational and technical support in times of high demand following natural disasters and software that helps detect fraudulent activity 
in addition to some of the software and services described above  we provide software and services that are not directly related to the automobile insurance claims process 
our databases at the core of our software and services are our proprietary databases 
each of our databases has been adapted for use in our local markets 
we have invested over million in the last ten years to maintain and expand our proprietary databases 
our primary databases include our repair estimating database  our total loss database  our claims database and our parts salvage databases 
repair estimating database 
we have created our repair estimating database over years through the development  collection  organization and management of automobile related information 
the data in this database enables our customers to estimate the cost to repair a damaged vehicle 
this database contains detailed cost data for each part and the required labor operations needed to complete repairs on over  vehicle types covers over of the vehicle models in our core markets includes vehicles data dating back to includes over million parts for vehicles with multiple model years  editions  option packages and country specific variations includes over one million aftermarket parts includes over one million graphics 
table of contents we update this database with data provided to us by third parties  including original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and aftermarket part suppliers  along with data we develop through our proprietary analyses of local labor repair times and damage repair techniques 
the quality and accuracy of the database  which are very important to each of our customers  are continuously monitored and maintained using rigorous quality control processes  which include updating over million data points every month 
total loss database 
our total loss database helps our customers determine the pre collision fair market values of vehicles that have been damaged beyond the point where repair is economically feasible  as well as the amounts they pay policyholders for total losses 
additionally  our employees use this database to provide total loss estimating service to our customers 
this database has been designed to accurately reflect the local fair market value of a vehicle rather than simply delivering a market value based on national or regional averages 
each year  we collect more than million for sale and sold vehicle records from over  automobile dealer sources  which we have combined with local market purchase and sale data collected from over  different sources  including websites  local newspapers  magazines and private listings 
we update this database by incorporating nearly two million data points per week which include the latest vehicle purchase and sale information including specific models  option packages  vehicle condition and mileage 
claims database 
our claims database enables our customers to evaluate their internal claims process performance  as well as measure the performance of their business partners 
our employees also use this database to provide consulting services to our customers and develop new software and services 
customers use this database to benchmark their performance against their local peer group through detailed analyses of comprehensive industry data 
compiled over the past years  this database contains approximately two billion data points representing over million automobile repair claims and over billion in claims payments 
we update this database by incorporating approximately  additional repair estimates every week 
parts salvage databases 
our parts salvage databases contain data on approximately million automobile parts through a network of approximately  automotive recyclers 
these databases are used by our customers to quickly find locally available automobile parts and identify interchangeable parts across different vehicles 
our global operations we are active in more than countries on six continents 
we have organized our operations into two regional operating segments  emea and americas 
emea our emea operating segment accounted for approximately of our revenues during fiscal year emea comprises our activities in over countries in europe  the middle east  africa and asia 
americas our americas operating segment accounted for approximately of our revenues during fiscal year americas comprises our activities in over countries in north  central  and south america  as well as the caribbean 

table of contents geographic financial information the table below sets forth the revenues we derived from the following geographic areas during each of the previous three fiscal years 
fiscal years ended june  acquisition pro forma in thousands united states the netherlands united kingdom germany other the table below sets forth the long lived assets we held in the following geographic areas at the end of each of the previous three fiscal years 
fiscal years ended june  in thousands united states the netherlands united kingdom germany other key competitive strengths leading global provider we are the leading global provider of software and services to the automobile insurance claims processing industry 
we are active in more than countries across six continents 
in most of our markets  we believe we are either the largest or second largest provider of automobile insurance claims processing software and services based on total revenues 
the large number of geographic regions in which we operate provides us with a strategic advantage when expanding into new markets by enabling us to utilize our database and vehicle coverage already present in adjacent or nearby markets 
as insurance companies continue to expand their businesses globally  our international leadership position should further position us as a single provider of automobile insurance claims processing software and services to our international insurance company customers 
significant barriers to entry we believe that our proprietary databases pose barriers to entry due to the significant capital investment and time that would be required to develop a similar set of integrated databases and customize them for use in local markets 
our proprietary databases have been built over years of developing  collecting  organizing and managing automobile related information and data 
we have invested over million in the last ten years in developing and maintaining our proprietary databases  and customizing them for use in local markets 
long standing relationships with customers we have long standing relationships with many of the world s largest automobile insurance companies 
for example  our relationships with our ten largest customers in europe and north america date back  on average  and years  respectively 
our software and services are typically integrated into our customers systems  operations and processes  often making it costly and time consuming for our customers to switch to another 
table of contents provider 
these long standing relationships have also allowed us to better understand our customers needs and further expand these relationships over time  both with additional software and by increasing our customer support and training services 
additionally  several of our customers own minority interests in five of our local operating subsidiaries 
we have found these partnerships to be effective when entering new markets as they have allowed us to collaborate more closely with our insurance company customers and rely on their local expertise to introduce  customize and market our software and services quickly and efficiently 
history of developing new software and services since our inception  we have consistently developed and marketed new software and services in order to meet the needs of our customers 
we work closely with our customers in order to determine the features and functions that they may require in the future 
we have developed and introduced new software and services to the market through both internal development as well as through the acquisition and licensing of products and technology owned by third parties 
for example  we recently introduced an auditing tool that allows insurance companies to identify repair estimates that should be further reviewed 
we believe our focus on software development and customization creates incremental revenue opportunities as we expand the number and sophistication of the software and services that we offer 
attractive operating model we believe we have an attractive operating model due to the recurring nature of our revenues  the scalability of our databases and software and the significant operating cash flow we generate 
contract based revenues 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from customers who have been under contract with us for several years 
for fiscal year  we generated over of our revenues from subscription based contracts where we charge a monthly fee  transaction based contracts where we charge a fee per transaction  and subscription based contracts with additional transaction based fees where we charge both a monthly fee and a fee per transaction  all of which generate recurring revenues from our customers 
scalable databases and software 
our databases and software have been designed to accommodate significant additional transaction and subscription based volumes with limited incremental costs 
the ability to generate additional revenues from increased subscription and transaction volumes without incurring substantial incremental costs provides us with opportunities to improve our operating margins 
significant operating cash flow generation 
we believe we are able to generate significant operating cash flows due to our operating margins and the relatively moderate working capital required to grow our business 
the operating cash flow we generate may be used to repay debt  finance acquisitions  expand geographically or further invest in database and software innovation 
business strategy broaden the scope of our software and services we intend to further broaden the capabilities  features and functionality of our claims processing software  as well as the breadth of our service offerings 
we believe that expanding the breadth of our offerings will allow us to retain and strengthen our relationships with our existing customers by helping them improve the efficiency of their claims process 
we also intend to develop new software and services for our insurance company customers that can help them process claims in areas other than automobile insurance 
expand customer base in existing markets we seek to expand our customer base in existing markets by competing on the quality of our software and services  our industry expertise  and our strong industry relationships 
in some markets  such as north america 
table of contents and western europe  we intend to seek new customers by competing favorably on both price and service  as well as by providing a complete suite of claims processing software and services that optimize each step of the claims process 
in other markets  such as eastern europe  latin america  china and india  we intend to use the combination of our local expertise with our global presence and comprehensive databases to serve new automobile insurance companies and other customers who can use our software and services to reduce claims related costs and increase their operational efficiencies 
expand into new markets as a result of recent growth in vehicle usage  regulatory and market developments  increasing penetration of automobile insurance  and rising adoption of automated claims processing by insurance companies  we believe that new markets represent significant opportunities for future growth 
we have a history of successfully entering markets that previously had not used automated claims processing software and services 
we intend to use this expertise to further expand in markets where we have recently established operations  such as china and india  and enter markets where we are not currently active 
improve operational efficiencies we seek to operate more efficiently  reduce costs and improve our operating margins 
we intend to pursue substantial operating margin improvements over the next two years 
major elements of this plan include productivity and technological enhancements and reduction of overhead 
we have identified and targeted several operational initiatives that we plan to implement over the next year  including the elimination of database and infrastructure redundancies productivity  and technology enhancements and reduction of overhead 
if implemented  we expect that these initiatives will improve our operating margins 
pursue strategic acquisitions we plan to supplement our organic growth by acquiring businesses or technologies that allow us to expand our range of services  increase our customer base or enter new markets 
when evaluating these opportunities  we will consider characteristics such as recurring revenues  strong operating and financial performance  enhanced products and services  long standing customer relationships and strong management personnel 
sales and marketing as of june   our sales and marketing staff included full time professionals 
our sales and marketing personnel identify and target specific sales opportunities and manage customer relationships 
they also design and plan launch strategies for new software and services  and plan and facilitate customer conferences and tradeshows 
our country managers are also involved in the sales and marketing process  though they are not counted as full time sales professionals 
customer support and training we believe that providing high quality customer support and training services is critical to our success 
as of june   we had full time customer support and training personnel  who provide telephone support  as well as on and off site implementation and training 
our customer support and training staff generally consists of individuals with expertise in both our software and services and in the automobile insurance and or collision repair industries 
software and database development we devote significant resources to the continued development of our software and databases 
we have created sophisticated processes and tools to achieve high quality software development and data accuracy 
our ability to maintain and grow our leading position in the automobile insurance claims processing industry is 
table of contents dependent upon our ability to enhance and broaden the scope of our software and services  as well as continuing to expand and improve our repair estimating  total loss  claims and parts salvage databases 
we often collaborate with our customers in the development process to focus on addressing their specific needs 
we then incorporate what we have learned from our customers workflow experiences and needs to deliver quality  workflow oriented software and services to the marketplace quickly 
we believe these efforts provide a significant competitive advantage in the development of new software and services 
as of june   our software development staff consisted of full time professionals across six international software development centers 
as of the same date  our database staff consisted of full time professionals across five international database development centers 
competition we compete primarily on the functionality of our software  the integrity and breadth of our data  customer service and price 
the competitive dynamics of the global automobile insurance claims processing industry vary by region  and our competitors are present in a subset of markets in which we operate 
in europe  our largest competitors include dat  gmbh and eurotaxglass group  with whom we compete in multiple countries 
in north america  our largest competitors include ccc information services group inc in the us and mitchell international inc in the us and canada 
in april  ccc information services group inc and mitchell international inc 
announced they have signed an agreement to combine their companies 
if their merger is consummated  the combined company will have a significant market share in the us market for automobile insurance claims processing software and services 
intellectual property and licenses we enter into license agreements with our customers  granting each customer a license to use our software and services while ensuring the protection of our ownership and the confidentiality of the embedded information and technology contained in our software 
as a general practice  employees  contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights  information and technology 
we own registered trademarks and service marks that we use in connection with our software and services  including their advertising and marketing 
for example  our trademark audatex is registered in over countries 
in the us and canada  we market our collision damage estimating and total loss valuation software under the registered trademarks penpro  shoplink and autosource 
we license much of the data used in our software and services through short term contracts with third parties  including oems  aftermarket parts suppliers  data aggregators  automobile dealerships and vehicle repair facilities  to whom we pay royalties 
employees as of june   we had  associates  including employees in our emea operating segment  employees in our americas operating segment  and employees in corporate roles 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

risk factors in addition to the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements included above in this annual report on form k  we also provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business 
these risks and uncertainties  as well as other factors that we may not be aware of  could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could cause assumptions that underlie our business plans  expectations and statements in this annual report on form k to be inaccurate 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of  or a significant reduction in volume from  any of these customers would harm our financial results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to large insurance companies 
in fiscal year  we derived of our revenues from our ten largest insurance company customers 
the largest three of these customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenues during this period 
a loss of one or more of these customers would result in a significant decrease in our revenues  including the business generated by collision repair facilities associated with those customers 
in fiscal year  we lost our principal shared services contract  which accounted for approximately of revenues 
during fiscal year  we were notified by a us insurance company customer that it will not renew its contract with us  and this customer has initiated the transition of our services to another provider 
this contract accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal year furthermore  many of our arrangements with european customers are terminable by them on short notice or at any time 
in addition  disputes with customers may lead to delays in payments to us  terminations of agreements or litigation 
additional terminations or non renewals of customer contracts or reductions in business from our large customers would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive pressures may require us to significantly lower our prices 
pricing pressures have required us to significantly lower prices for some of our software and services in several of our markets 
we may be required to implement further price reductions in response to the following price reductions by competitors the consolidation of property and casualty insurance companies the introduction of competing software or services a decrease in the frequency of accidents if we are required to accept lower prices for our software and services  it would result in decreased revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our industry is highly competitive  and our failure to compete effectively could result in a loss of customers and market share  which could harm our revenues and operating results 
the markets for our automobile insurance claims processing software and services are highly competitive 
in the us  our principal competitors are ccc information services group inc and mitchell international inc 
in europe  our principal competitors are eurotaxglass s group and dat  gmbh 
if one or more of our competitors develop software or services that are superior to ours or are more effective in marketing its software or services  our market share could decrease  reducing our revenues 
in addition  if one or more of our competitors retain existing or attract new customers for which we have developed new software or services  we may not realize expected revenues from these new offerings  reducing our profitability 
some of our current or future competitors may have or develop closer customer relationships  develop stronger brands  have greater access to capital  lower cost structures and or more attractive system design and 
table of contents operational capabilities than we have 
consolidation within our industry could result in the formation of competitors with substantially greater financial  management or marketing resources than we have  and such competitors could utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale in a manner that affects our ability to compete in the relevant market or markets 
for example  in april  ccc information services group inc and mitchell international inc  our principal competitors in the us  announced they have signed an agreement to combine their companies 
if their merger is consummated  the combined company will have a significant market share in the us market 
as a result of consolidation  our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs  devote greater resources to promoting or selling their products and services  initiate and withstand substantial price competition  expand into new markets  hire away our key employees  change or limit access to key information and systems  take advantage of acquisition or other strategic opportunities more readily and develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we can 
in addition  our competitors may form strategic or exclusive relationships with each other and with other companies in attempts to compete more successfully against us 
these relationships may increase our competitors ability  relative to ours  to address customer needs with their software and service offerings  which may enable them to rapidly increase their market share 
moreover  many insurance companies have historically entered into agreements with automobile insurance claims processing service providers like us and our competitors whereby the insurance company agrees to use that provider on an exclusive or preferred basis for particular products and services and agrees to require collision repair facilities  independent assessors and other vendors to use that provider 
if our competitors are more successful than we are at negotiating these exclusive or preferential arrangements  we may lose market share even in markets where we retain other competitive advantages 
in addition  our insurance company customers have varying degrees of in house development capabilities  and one or more of them have expanded and may seek to further expand their capabilities in the areas in which we operate 
many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and could commit significant resources to product development 
our software and services have been  and may in the future be  replicated by our insurance company customers in house  which could result in our loss of those customers and their associated repair facilities  independent assessors and other vendors  resulting in decreased revenues and net income 
the time and expense associated with switching from our competitors software and services to ours may limit our growth 
the costs for an insurance company to switch providers of claims processing software and services can be significant and the process can sometimes take to months to complete 
as a result  potential customers may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our software and services  even if we offer competitive and economic advantages 
if we are unable to convince these customers to switch to our software and services  our ability to increase market share will be limited  which could harm our revenues and operating results 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes  and if we fail to keep pace with these changes  our market share and revenues will decline 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of  and enhancements to  existing software and services  all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost 
industry changes could render our offerings less attractive or obsolete  and we may be unable to make the necessary adjustments to our offerings at a competitive cost  or at all 
we also incur substantial expenses in researching  developing  designing and marketing new software and services 
the development or adaptation of these new technologies may result in unanticipated expenditures and capital costs that would not be recovered in the event that our new software or services are unsuccessful 
the research  development  production and marketing of new software and services are also subject to changing market requirements  as well as the 
table of contents satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and customers approval procedures and other factors  each of which could prevent us from successfully marketing any new software and services or responding to competing technologies 
the success of new software in our industry also often depends on the ability to be first to market  and our failure to be first to market with any particular software project could limit our ability to recover the development expenses associated with that project 
if we cannot develop new technologies  software and services or any of our existing software or services are rendered obsolete  our revenues and income could decline and we may lose market share to our competitors  which would impact our future operations and financial results 
changes in or violations by us or our customers of applicable government regulations could reduce demand for or limit our ability to provide our software and services in those jurisdictions 
our insurance company customers are subject to extensive government regulations  mainly at the state level in the us and at the country level in our non us markets 
some of these regulations relate directly to our software and services  including regulations governing the use of total loss and estimating software 
if our insurance company customers fail to comply with new or existing insurance regulations  including those applicable to our software and services  they could lose their certifications to provide insurance and or reduce their usage of our software and services  either of which would reduce our revenues 
also  we are subject to direct regulation in some markets  and our failure to comply with these regulations could significantly reduce our revenues or subject us to government sanctions 
in addition  future regulations could force us to implement costly changes to our software and or databases or have the effect of prohibiting or rendering less valuable one or more of our offerings 
moreover  some states in the us have changed their regulations to permit insurance companies to use book valuations for total loss calculations  making our total loss software potentially less valuable to insurance companies in those states 
some states have adopted total loss regulations  that  among other things  require insurers use a methodology deemed acceptable to the respective government agency 
we submit our methodology to such agencies  and if they do not approve our methodology  we will not be able to perform total loss valuations in their respective states 
other states are considering legislation that would limit the data that our software can provide to our insurance company customers 
in the event that demand for or our ability to provide our software and services decreases in particular jurisdictions due to regulatory changes  our revenues and margins may decrease 
in addition  the belgian competition department notified us that it has chosen to continue to investigate a complaint relating to estimates generated by our software of the costs to repair damaged vehicles originally brought by a trade association representing collision repair facilities that was withdrawn by the trade association in pursuant to european union competition laws  the belgian competition department has asserted its authority to conduct this investigation as it relates to the western european region 
the south african competition commission is investigating a complaint brought by a trade association representing collision repair facilities against the south african insurance association  as well as motor vehicle insurers and assessors  relating to estimates generated by our software of the costs to repair damaged vehicles 
our future operating results may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we derive most of our revenues  and incur most of our costs  including a portion of our debt service costs  in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro 
except for the certain derivative instruments described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included pursuant to item of this annual report on form k  we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks 
in our historical financial statements  we re measure our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
these re measurements resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of million in fiscal year further fluctuations in exchange rates against the us dollar could decrease our revenues  increase our costs and expenses and therefore harm our future operating results 
we believe that extended periods of dollar weakness are positive for operating income and extended periods of dollar strength are negative  although the precise impact is difficult to assess 

table of contents we have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the april acquisition 
our earnings will be harmed if we suffer an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets 
we have a large amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and are required to perform an annual assessment for possible impairment for accounting purposes 
at june  and  we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
if we do not achieve our planned operating results or other factors impair these assets  we may be required to incur a non cash impairment charge 
any impairment charges in the future will adversely affect our results of operations 
we may incur significant restructuring and severance charges in future periods  which would harm our operating results and cash position or increase debt 
we incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal year these charges consist primarily of termination benefits paid or to be paid to employees 
as of june   our remaining obligation associated with these restructuring charges and others from prior periods is million 
we regularly evaluate our existing operations and capacity  and we expect to incur additional restructuring charges as a result of future personnel reductions  related restructuring and productivity and technology enhancements  which could exceed the levels of our historical charges 
we are currently evaluating further plans that  if all implemented  would result in additional restructuring charges ranging from to million over the next to months 
these potential charges could harm our operating results and significantly reduce our cash position or increase debt 
in addition  we may incur certain unforeseen costs once these activities are implemented 
we have a history of net losses and may not maintain profitability in the future 
for fiscal years  and  we had net income loss of million  million and million  respectively 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
fiscal year was our first year since the april acquisition for which we did not report a significant loss 
we will need to maintain or increase revenues and maintain or reduce expenses  which include the amortization of the remaining million of intangible assets that we had as of june  and interest expense associated with our indebtedness  to improve or sustain our profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve a significant level of profitability 
future decreases in profitability could reduce or stock price  and future net losses would reduce our stock price 
we have a very limited operating history as a stand alone company  which may make it difficult to evaluate our future operating results 
prior to the april acquisition  our predecessor operated as a business unit of adp 
our predecessor relied on adp during this period for many of its internal functions  including accounting  tax  payroll  technology and administrative and operational support 
we now perform these functions and services with internal resources or through third party service providers 
if we are unable to effectively perform these services internally or maintain substitute arrangements on terms that are favorable to us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  the historical financial information of our predecessor included in this annual report on form k may not reflect what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate stand alone company without the shared resources of adp for the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for example  adp allocated expenses and other centralized operating costs to our predecessor for periods prior to the acquisition  and the allocated costs included in our predecessor s historical financial statements could differ from amounts that we would have incurred if we had operated on a stand alone basis 

table of contents we require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which reduces the cash available to finance our organic growth  make strategic acquisitions and enter into alliances and joint ventures 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of june   our indebtedness  including current maturities  was million  and we would have been able to borrow an additional million under our amended and restated senior credit facility 
during fiscal year  our aggregate interest expense was million and the cash paid for interest was million 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in our revenues make it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations for making payments on our indebtedness  which would prevent us from using it for other purposes  including software development make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements make it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances and collaborations our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments  we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
we cannot assure you that debt refinancings or asset dispositions could be completed on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments 
our software and services rely on information generated by third parties and any interruption of our access to such information could materially harm our operating results 
we believe that our success depends significantly on our ability to provide our customers access to data from many different sources 
for example  a substantial portion of the data used in our repair estimating software is derived from parts and repair data provided by  among others  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  aftermarket parts suppliers  data aggregators  automobile dealerships and vehicle repair facilities 
we obtain much of our data about vehicle parts and components and collision repair labor and costs through license agreements with oems  automobile dealers  and other providers 
eurotaxglass s group  one of our primary competitors in europe  provides us with valuation and paint data for use in our european markets pursuant to a similar arrangement  and mitchell international  one of our primary competitors in the us  provides us with vehicle glass data for use in our us markets pursuant to a similar arrangement 
many of the license agreements through which we obtain data are for terms of one year and or may be terminated without cost to the provider on short notice 
if one or more of our licenses are terminated or if we are unable to renew one or more of these licenses on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to access alternative data sources that would provide comparable information without incurring substantial additional costs 
recently  some oem sources have indicated to us that they intend to materially increase the licensing costs for their data 
while we do not believe that our access to most individual sources of data is material to our operations  prolonged industry wide price increases or reductions in data availability could make receiving certain data more difficult and could result in significant cost increases  which would materially harm our operating results 

table of contents system failures  delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business  cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability 
our success depends on our ability to provide accurate  consistent and reliable services and information to our customers on a timely basis 
our operations could be interrupted by any damage to or failure of our computer software or hardware or our customers or third party service providers computer software or hardware our networks  our customers networks or our third party service providers networks our connections to and outsourced service arrangements with third parties  such as acxiom  which hosts data and applications for us and our customers our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss or other telecommunications failures earthquakes  fires  floods  hurricanes and other natural disasters computer viruses or software defects physical or electronic break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events errors by our employees or third party service providers as part of our ongoing process improvements efforts  we have and will continue to migrate product and system platforms to next generation platforms  and the risks noted above will be exacerbated by our migration efforts 
because many of our services play a mission critical role for our customers  any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on  including those of our customers and vendors  could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner  which could result in the loss of current and or potential customers 
in addition  we generally indemnify our customers to a limited extent for damages they sustain related to the unavailability of  or errors in  the software and services we provide  therefore  a significant interruption of  or errors in  our software and services could expose us to significant customer liability 
security breaches could result in lost revenues  litigation claims and or harm to our reputation 
our databases contain confidential data relating to our customers  policyholders and other industry participants 
security breaches  particularly those involving connectivity to the internet  and the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents  could significantly harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our databases could be vulnerable to physical system or network break ins or other inappropriate access  which could result in claims against us and or harm our reputation 
in addition  potential competitors may obtain our data illegally and use it to provide services that are competitive to ours 
we are active in over countries  where we are subject to country specific risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
in fiscal year and  we generated approximately and of our revenues outside the us  respectively  and we expect revenues from non us markets to continue to represent a majority of our total revenues 
business and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs and trade barriers  investments  taxation  currency exchange controls and repatriation of earnings 
our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our activities across more than different countries 
furthermore  our business strategy includes expansion of our operations into new and developing markets  which will require even greater international coordination  expose us to additional local government regulations and involve markets in which we do not have experience or established 
table of contents operations 
in addition  our operations in each country are vulnerable to changes in socio economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies  intellectual property protection disputes  the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems  the collection of receivables through foreign legal systems  exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions  unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks 
these and other factors may harm our operations in those countries and therefore our business and results of operations 
our operating results may vary widely from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our contracts with insurance companies generally require time consuming authorization procedures by the customer  which can result in additional delays between when we incur development costs and when we begin generating revenues from those software or services offerings 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future 
in addition  we incur significant operating expenses while we are researching and designing new software and related services  and we typically do not receive corresponding payments in those same periods 
as a result  the number of new software and services offerings that we are able to implement  successfully or otherwise  can cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations  and we may experience a decrease in our net income as we incur the expenses necessary to develop and design new software and services 
we also may experience variations in our earnings due to other factors beyond our control  such as the introduction of new software or services by our competitors  customer acceptance of new software or services  the volume of usage of our offerings by existing customers  variations of vehicle accident rates due to factors such as changes in fuel prices and their impact on vehicle usage  and competitive conditions  or changes in competitive conditions  in our industry generally 
we may also incur significant or unanticipated expenses when contracts expire  are terminated or are not renewed 
any of these events could harm our financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
future acquisitions and joint ventures or dispositions may require significant resources and or result in significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
we have grown in part  and in the future may continue to grow  by making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures or similar arrangements 
acquisitions and joint ventures require significant investment and managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations  and could entail a number of additional risks  including problems with effective integration of operations and or management loss of key customers  suppliers or employees increased operating costs exposure to unanticipated liabilities furthermore  we participate in joint ventures in some countries 
our partners in these ventures may have interests and goals that are inconsistent with or different from ours  which could result in the joint venture taking actions that negatively impact our growth in the local market and consequently harm our business or financial condition 
if we are unable to find suitable partners or if suitable partners are unwilling to enter into joint ventures with us  our growth into new geographic markets may slow  which would harm our results of operations 
additionally  we may finance future acquisitions and or joint ventures with cash from operations  additional indebtedness and or the issuance of additional securities  any of which may impair the operation of our business or present additional risks  such as reduced liquidity or increased interest expense 
we may seek also to restructure our business in the future by disposing of certain of our assets  which may harm our future operating results  divert significant managerial attention from our operations and or require us to accept non cash consideration  the market value of which may fluctuate 

table of contents we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to develop and market new software and services and to generate revenues at levels sufficient to cover ongoing expenses 
if we need to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our stockholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our outstanding common stock 
in the case of debt financings  we may have to grant additional security interests in our assets to lenders and agree to restrictive business and operating covenants 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and  accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
privacy concerns could require us to exclude data from our software and services  which may reduce the value of our offerings to our customers  damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our software and services 
in the european union and other jurisdictions  there are significant restrictions on the use of personal data 
violations of these laws would harm our business 
in addition  concerns about our collection  use or sharing of automobile insurance claims information or other privacy related matters  even if unfounded  could damage our reputation and operating results 
our business depends on our brands  and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business 
we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands  such as audatex  abz  hollander  informex  sidexa and ims  are critical to the expansion of our software and services to new customers in both existing and new markets 
maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort  our business  operating results and financial condition will be harmed 
we anticipate that  as our markets become increasingly competitive  maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive 
maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a technology innovator and to continue to provide high quality software and services  which we may not do successfully 
to date  we have not engaged in extensive direct brand promotion activities  and we may not successfully implement brand enhancement efforts in the future 
third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights  and we could be prevented from selling our software or suffer significant litigation expense even if these claims have no merit 
our competitive position is driven in part by our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
third parties  however  may claim that software  products or technology  including claims data or other data  which we obtain from other parties are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our assets  technology  software or services 
any litigation initiated against us regarding patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  even litigation relating to claims without merit  could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from operating our business 
in addition  if any third party has a meritorious or successful claim that we are infringing upon its intellectual property rights  we may be forced to change our software or enter into licensing arrangement with third parties  which may be costly or impractical 
these claims may also require us to stop selling our software and or services as currently designed  which could harm our competitive position 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions that prevent the further development and sale of certain of our software or services and may result in a material loss in revenue 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights  either without incurring significant costs or at all  which would harm our business 
we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  patents  license agreements and contractual provisions  as well as internal procedures  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
the steps we have taken and will take to protect our intellectual property rights may not deter infringement  duplication  misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property by third parties 
in addition  any of the intellectual property we own or license from third parties may be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  the laws of some of the countries in which products similar to ours may be developed may not protect our software and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
we may also be unable to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants  vendors  former employees or current employees  despite the existence of nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive advantages 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we may not receive any return on the resources expended to create the intellectual property or generate any competitive advantage based on it 
pursuing infringers of our intellectual property could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management resources  and any failure to pursue or successfully litigate claims against infringers could result in competitors using our technology and offering similar products and services  potentially resulting in loss of competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
we are currently engaged in litigation in canada against an alleged infringer of certain of our copyrights 
currently  we believe that one or more of our customers in our emea segment may be infringing our intellectual property by making and distributing unauthorized copies of our software 
enforcement of these intellectual property rights may be difficult and may require considerable resources 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace 
if we lose the services of these individuals  or are unable to attract new talent  our business will be adversely affected 
we depend upon the ability and experience of our key personnel  who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing automobile insurance claims processing industry and the markets in which we offer our software and services 
the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key employees  particularly our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  tony aquila  could harm our business and operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage and retain other qualified management  sales and technical personnel as we grow 
we may not be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel in the future 
our amended and restated senior credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our amended and restated senior credit facility contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock  prepay other debt  encumber our assets  incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures above specified levels  engage in business combinations or undertake various other corporate activities 
these covenants may require us also to maintain certain specified financial ratios  including those relating to total leverage and interest coverage 
our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance our debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on acceptable or reasonable terms 
an acceleration of our indebtedness would impair our ability to operate as a going concern 

table of contents current or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on us 
we have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings  claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
for example  we have been involved in disputes with collision repair facilities  acting individually and as a group in some situations that claim that we have colluded with our insurance company customers to depress the repair time estimates generated by our repair estimating software 
in addition  we are currently one of the defendants in a putative class action lawsuit alleging that we have colluded with our insurance company customers to cause the estimates of vehicle fair market value generated by our total loss estimation software to be unfairly low 
furthermore  we are also subject to assertions by our customers and strategic partners that we have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them  some of which are the subject of pending litigation and any of which could in the future lead to arbitration or litigation 
while we do not expect the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  litigation is unpredictable and excessive verdicts  both in the form of monetary damages and injunction  could occur 
in the future  we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could harm our financial position and results of operations 
if we are not able to maintain adequate compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we regularly evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated 
this report contains management s evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation to our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year we will continue to evaluate our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
we will continue to perform the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section  we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission  or sec  or the new york stock exchange  or nyse 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results or investors confidence in us and could cause our stock price to fall 
requirements associated with being a public company increase our costs significantly  as well as divert significant company resources and management attention 
prior to our initial public offering in may  we were not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  or the other rules and regulations of the sec or any securities exchange relating to public companies 
we continue to work with our legal  independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company 
these areas include corporate governance  corporate control  internal audit  disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems 
we have made  and will continue to make  changes in these and other areas 
however  the expenses that are required as a result of being a public company are and will likely continue to be material 
compliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies also require considerable time and attention of management 
until we have more experience operating as a public company  we may have difficulty predicting or estimating the amount of the additional costs we may incur  the timing of such costs or the degree of impact that our management s attention to these matters will have on our business 
in addition  the changes we make may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis 
in addition  being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officers liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced 
table of contents policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which stockholders may receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors 
these provisions include authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock without the need for action by stockholders the removal of directors only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote any vacancy on the board of directors  however occurring  including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board  may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders and limited ability of stockholders to take action by written consent advance notice requirements for board nominations and proposing matters to be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings we currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock  and as a result  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates 
we currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our amended and restated senior credit facility limits our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
as a result  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit 
we cannot assure you that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay

we have from time to time been the subject of allegations that our repair estimating and total loss software and services produced results that favored our insurance company customers 
we are also subject to assertions by our customers and strategic partners that we have not complied with the terms of our agreements with them  some of which are the subject of pending litigation 
in addition  we are currently one of the defendants in a putative class action lawsuit alleging that we have colluded with our insurance company customers to cause the estimates of vehicle fair market value generated by our total loss estimation products to be unfairly low

as a result  the combined financial information of csg  which is included in this annual report on form k  is presented on a carve out basis and reflects the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses that were attributed or allocated to it as a business unit of adp 
the historical financial results in the combined financial statements may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had we operated as a stand alone entity 
these combined financial statements include costs for facilities  functions and services used by csg at adp sites that it shared with other adp business units and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized adp organizations and directly charged to csg based on usage 
the combined statements of earnings for csg include allocations of certain expenses of adp  including general corporate overhead  insurance  stock compensation and pension plans  royalty fees  facilities and other expenses 
these allocations were based on a variety of factors 
in may  in connection with our initial public offering  we converted from a limited liability company into a delaware corporation  and all of the class a common units and class b preferred units of solera holdings  llc were converted into shares of our common stock 

table of contents segments we operate our business using two reportable segments emea and americas 
our emea segment consists of our operations in europe  the middle east  africa and asia 
our americas segment consists of our operations in north  central and south america 
we do not allocate certain costs to reportable segments 
these costs are managed at the corporate level and include costs related to financing activities of the company 
the table below sets forth our revenues by regional operating segment and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended june  acquisition pro forma emea americas total set forth below is our percentage of revenues for the periods presented from each of our principal customer categories fiscal years ended june  acquisition pro forma insurance companies collision repair facilities independent assessors automotive recyclers and others total for fiscal year  the united states  the netherlands and the united kingdom were the only countries that individually represented more than of total revenues 
the accounting policies for each of our segments are the same 
we evaluate the operating performance of our segments based primarily upon their respective revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
for the most part  we do not evaluate our costs and expenses on a per segment basis 
components of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues from the sale of software and services to our customers pursuant to negotiated contracts or pricing agreements 
pricing for our software and services is set forth in these agreements and negotiated with each customer 
we generally bill our customers monthly under one or more of the following bases price per transaction fixed monthly amount for a prescribed number of transactions fixed monthly subscription rate price per set of services rendered price per system delivered 
table of contents our software and services are often sold as packages  without individual pricing for each component 
our revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which we estimate based on both our examination of a subset of customer accounts and historical experience 
elsewhere in this annual report on form k  solely for ease of understanding  we have grouped our software and services into five general categories estimating and workflow software  salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  shared services and other 
see business our software and services 
our core offering is our estimating and workflow software  which is used by our insurance company  collision repair facility and independent assessor customers and which we believe represents the majority of our revenues 
we believe that our salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  shared services and other offerings represent in the aggregate a smaller portion of our revenues 
we currently derive an insubstantial portion of our revenues from our shared services offerings 
we believe that our estimating and workflow software will continue to represent a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization our costs and expenses applicable to revenues represent the total of operating expenses and systems development and programming costs  which are discussed below 
operating expenses our operating expenses include compensation and benefit costs for our operations  database development and customer service personnel  other costs related to operations  database development and customer support functions  third party data and royalty costs  and costs related to computer software and hardware used in the delivery of our software and services 
systems development and programming costs systems development and programming costs include compensation and benefit costs for our product development and product management personnel  other costs related to our product development and product management functions and costs related to external software consultants involved in systems development and programming activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefit costs for our sales  marketing  administration and corporate personnel  costs related to our facilities  and professional and legal fees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation includes depreciation attributable to buildings  leasehold improvements  data processing and computer equipment  furniture and fixtures 
amortization includes amortization attributable to software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use and our intangible assets  the majority of which were acquired in the april acquisition 
interest expense interest expense consists primarily of payments of interest on our credit facilities and amortization of related debt issuance costs 
other income expense net other income expense net consists of foreign exchange gains and losses on notes receivable and notes payable to affiliates  interest income  as well as other miscellaneous income and expense 

table of contents minority interests in net income of consolidated subsidiaries several of our customers own minority interests in our local operating subsidiaries 
minority interests in net income of consolidated subsidiaries reflect such customers proportionate interest in the earnings of such operating subsidiaries 
income tax provision benefit prior to our corporate reorganization in may  we were a limited liability company and  therefore  we were not subject to entity level federal income taxation 
however  even as a limited liability company  we incurred income taxes on our operations as they were held by taxable entities in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
historical financial statements for our predecessor  which was a c corporation for federal income tax purposes  are based on corporate tax rates for the periods presented 
prior to our corporate reorganization  our income taxes were payable by our equity holders at rates applicable to them 
following our conversion to a c corporation  transactions recorded by us are subject to federal income taxation for which we do not expect a significant impact to our overall income tax liability 
income taxes have been provided for all items included in the statements of income loss included herein  regardless of when such items were reported for tax purposes or when the taxes were actually paid or refunded 
as part of the april acquisition  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
for most jurisdictions in which we operate  the amortization charges and impairment charges will not be deductible for income tax purposes 
the net deferred tax liability as shown on our balance sheet is primarily the result of the difference between book and tax basis of the acquired intangible assets 
factors affecting our operating results overview 
the automobile insurance claims processing industry is influenced by growth and trends in the automobile insurance industry 
demand for our software and services is generally related to automobile usage and the penetration of automobile insurance in our markets 
a large portion of our operating costs are fixed and we generate a large percentage of our revenues from periodic and transaction based fees related to software and ongoing claims processing services 
our operating results are and will be influenced by a variety of factors  including gain and loss of customers competitive and pricing pressures expansions into new markets  which requires us to incur costs prior to generating revenues expenses to develop new software or services restructuring charges related to efficiency initiatives the april acquisition  including the debt we incurred our corporate reorganization and the refinancing transactions foreign currency 
during fiscal years and we generated approximately and of our revenues  respectively  and incurred a majority of our costs  in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks except for the foreign exchange option noted below 
in our historical financial statements  we re measure our local currency financial results in us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
these re measurements resulted in foreign currency translation adjustments of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
foreign currency losses gains flowing through our consolidated statements of operations in fiscal years   and were million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents in february  we entered into a foreign exchange option that gave us the right to call million in us dollars at a strike price of per us dollar at any time up to february  we paid approximately million for this option 
the fair value of this option was approximately million as of june  and million as of june   and has been recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
increases decreases in fair value of approximately million  million  and million were recognized in other expense income in the statement of operations during fiscal years   and  respectively 
non cash charges 
in fiscal years and  we granted the right to purchase class a common units to certain employees 
under these and other arrangements  we issued an aggregate of  class a common units to of our employees for million in january and an aggregate of  class a common units to two of our employees for  in february in may  we issued restricted stock units covering an aggregate of  shares to certain of our employees 
in fiscal year we issued restricted stock units covering an aggregate of  shares to cetain of our employees 
for all restricted stock units outstanding as of june  we expect the remaining pre tax  non cash charge to be approximately million  expensed ratably over vesting periods of up to months 
in fiscal year  we incurred an additional pre tax  non cash charge of approximately million on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the completion of our initial public offering and the refinancing of debt 
this relates primarily to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment premium on our second lien credit facility and our subordinated unsecured credit facility 
restructuring charges 
we have incurred restructuring charges or reversal in each period presented and also expect to incur additional restructuring charges  primarily relating to severance costs  over the next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business 
we are currently evaluating several plans that would eliminate redundant personnel activities in each of our segments  as well as reduce our need for certain facilities 
if all of these plans were to be executed upon  we would expect to incur restructuring charges ranging from to million over the next to months 
these potential charges  consisting primarily of termination benefits  will reduce our cash balances 
the resulting benefit of these restructuring plans  if implemented  is not determinable at this time 
we do not expect reduced revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of any of these restructuring plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements of solera holdings  inc have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for our judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of solera holdings  inc and the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
if an impairment exists  a write down to fair value normally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows is recorded 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on expected revenues to be generated from the use of such assets and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as of june  and  we had goodwill of million and million  respectively  and intangible assets of million and million  respectively

 in accounting for our revenue arrangements 
revenues are recognized only after services are provided  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses  hosted database and other services  installation and set up services  hardware  maintenance services and transaction based deliverables 
we generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription based contracts where a monthly fee is charged  transaction based contracts where a fee per transaction is charged and subscription based contracts with additional transaction based fees where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged 
subscription based and transaction based contracts generally include the delivery of software  access to software through a hosted service  or hosted database  upfront fees for the implementation and set up activities necessary for the client to use access the software  or implementation services  and maintenance 
under a subscription arrangement  delivery of software  access to the hosted database and maintenance are considered a single element or a combined unit of accounting  and related revenues are recognized at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service 
revenues under transaction based contracts are recognized based on the guidance in aicpa technical practice aid no

stock based compensation 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and share awards  based on estimated fair values recognized over the requisite service period 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  we accounted for employee share awards under accounting principles board  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and followed the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
we made the following grants of  or granted the following rights to purchase  common units shares or restricted common units shares from january  to june  grant date number of restricted common shares units purchase price per common share unit fair value per common share unit was fair value determined in a contemporaneous valuation intrinsic value per unit based on fair value and purchase price intrinsic value per unit based on the initial public offering price pre ipo april   yes july   no november   yes february   yes may   yes post ipo fiscal year as of june   we had  shares outstanding 
the aggregate intrinsic value of these outstanding shares as of june  was million  of which million related to  vested shares and million related to  unvested shares 
from the april acquisition date until our may initial public offering date  each time we granted equity awards to our employees  we determined the fair value of our aggregate equity  as well as the individual fair value of each of our preferred and common units 
the terms of the preferred units provided that such units could be redeemed by us at any time at their redemption value  which was equal to the unreturned capital contributions made in respect of such preferred units  plus accrued and unpaid yield of per annum 
as a result  a significant portion of any subsequent increase in our aggregate equity value  as determined at each subsequent measurement date  was attributed to the common units as opposed to the preferred units 
the fixed return nature of the preferred units was demonstrated by the formula we used to convert our preferred units into shares of common stock in our corporate reorganization the liquidation value of the preferred units plus accrued and unpaid yield divided by the initial public offering price 
we acquired csg from adp in based on a competitive auction process 
we therefore believe that the enterprise value and aggregate equity value derived from this transaction were representative of their respective fair values 
the enterprise fair value was validated by using market multiple and discounted cash flow methods 
we used an internal rate of return  or irr  method to allocate our aggregate equity value between our preferred and common units 
the irr method is similar to the probability weighted expected return method described in 
table of contents the aicpa audit and accounting practice aid for valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
we determined that the irr method was the most appropriate method to use because it enabled us to directly determine the value of our preferred units based upon an expected return method using market rates  and thus  to allocate any remaining aggregate equity value to our common units 
the irr method is based upon the value we assign to various future outcomes or exit events 
the per unit values are based on the probability weighted present value of expected future returns  considering each of the possible future outcomes available to us  as well as the rights of each class of our equity securities 
on april   using the irr method described above  we determined that the value of each preferred unit was equal to per unit and that the value of each common unit was equal to per unit 
we assumed a year holding period based upon a hypothetical exit event in june  which we considered reasonable at the time based on typical targeted holding periods for private equity funds 
because we had just acquired the csg and assembled a new management team  we considered an exit event that is typical for private equity funds as the most appropriate outcome for us 
we assigned a probability to this expected outcome 
a irr was targeted for the preferred units based on the median irr of various preferred spread studies we determined to be relevant 
based on the targeted return for the preferred units  we derived an implied return on our common equity of 
the aggregate equity return was derived based on ebitda exit multiples of x 
these exit multiples were deemed appropriate based on comparable company multiples and our financial projections at the time 
we determined that the aggregate equity return of approximately was consistent with expected returns of financial sponsors in similar situations 
on july   we determined that there was no change in the fair value of the common units from april   and therefore used a value of per common unit to determine the compensation expense for the rights to purchase common units we granted on that date 
we believed that there was no change in fair value between april  and july  due to the following factors the relative valuation metrics of the selected comparable publicly traded companies increased as much as and decreased by as much as  with an average decrease of during this period  and we searched for and were unable to find any acquisitions of comparable businesses during the period from april  to july   causing us to determine that there was no change in the acquisition multiples of comparable businesses contained in the april  report  our financial projections  growth and cash flow forecasts on july  had not changed significantly from those used in the april  discounted cash flows method of valuation due to the limited passage of time  we experienced no significant developments between april  and july   such as significant contract wins that would have impacted relative valuations  and we had no discussions with external parties  including investment banks  regarding our prospects during this period 
on november   we determined that our aggregate equity value had increased by approximately million as a result of an increase in our enterprise value of approximately million and a reduction in our net debt of approximately million since the prior measurement date of july  we used the irr method described above to allocate this increase to our preferred and common units 
we used a holding period of approximately years  as we still considered an exit event in june to be a reasonable assumption 
this assumption was unchanged from the april  assumption  except for the passage of time 
as a result  we assigned a probability to this expected outcome 
we used a targeted irr for the preferred units based on the median of various preferred spread studies we determined to be relevant 
based on the targeted return for the preferred units  we derived an implied return on our common equity of 
the aggregate equity return was derived based on ebitda exit multiples of x 
these exit multiples were deemed appropriate based on comparable company multiples and our financial projections at that time 
we determined that an aggregate equity return of approximately was consistent with expected returns of financial sponsors in similar situations 
due to the redemption price of our preferred units being fixed  approximately million of the million increase was ascribed to common units and approximately million was ascribed to preferred units 
the approximately million increase in the value of our common units consisted of approximately million attributed to the use of a comparable public company ebitda multiple that was higher than the implied purchase price multiple paid in the acquisition for valuation purposes  
table of contents approximately million attributed to an increase in our adjusted ebitda for the last twelve months of approximately million  and approximately million attributed to a reduction in our net debt 
as a result  the approximately increase in our enterprise value resulted in a more than increase in the value of our common equity 
on november   using the irr method described above  we determined that the value of each preferred unit was equal to per unit and the value of each common unit was equal to per unit 
on february   we determined that our aggregate equity value had increased by approximately million as a result of an increase in our enterprise value of approximately million  offset by an increase in our net debt of approximately million since the prior measurement date of november  to derive the aggregate equity value  we used the irr method with two holding period scenarios a scenario involving an initial public offering  or ipo  within three months  and a year holding period resulting in an exit event in june similar to our assumptions of april  and november  we applied a probability to the ipo scenario and a probability to the year holding period scenario 
we considered the three month scenario to be reasonable given our progress towards making a filing with the sec regarding an initial public offering 
we applied a greater probability to the three month holding period approach as the probability of a filing for an ipo was estimated to be high 
for both exit scenarios  an ipo and a sale  an irr was targeted for the preferred units based on the median of various preferred spread studies we determined to be relevant 
based on the targeted return for the preferred units  we derived implied returns on the common equity of using a year holding period and using three month period 
the aggregate equity returns were derived based on ebitda exit multiples of x year holding period and x three month holding period 
these exit multiples were deemed appropriate based on comparable company multiples and our financial projections at that time 
the aggregate equity returns of approximately year holding period and three month holding period are consistent with expected returns of financial sponsors in similar situations 
due to the redemption price of our preferred units being fixed  approximately million of the million increase was ascribed to common units and approximately million was ascribed to preferred units 
on february   using the irr method described above  we determined that the value of each preferred unit was equal to per unit and the value of each common unit was equal to per unit 
from may  through june   all equity awards were granted as a public company 
accordingly  all stock options granted after february  have an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant ie the closing price of our common stock and all restricted shares and units were granted at par value with the corresponding stock based compensation charge tied to the fair market value on the date of grant 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars based on exchange rates in effect at the end of each period  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the periods 
functional currencies of significant foreign subsidiaries include euros  british pounds  swiss francs  and canadian dollars 
currency transaction gains losses  which are included in the results of operations  totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
gains or losses from balance sheet translation are included in stockholders equity within accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
internal use software 
expenditures for software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a three to five year period on a straight line basis 
for software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize costs in accordance with the provisions of sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
our policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software 
in addition  we also capitalize certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects 
the amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  training  maintenance  and all other post implementation 
table of contents stage activities are expensed as incurred 
we also expense internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we also account for any uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  such as the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the respective tax authority 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing for tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences  or reversing book tax differences  resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and to the extent we believe that realizability does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include a tax expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations unless a current year valuation allowance is allocated to an item of equity 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowances  which could impact our results of operations in the quarter in which such determination is made 
at june   our deferred tax assets of approximately million are comprised of million of net operating losses and the remainder to temporary differences 
approximately  million and million of our net operating losses are generated in the us and the netherlands  respectively  and are attributed primarily to interest expense under our debt agreements 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence as of june   it was concluded that it was not more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets would be realized and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was established against our us net deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our net operating losses in the netherlands and as in the prior year we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income after interest expenses to realize the benefits of the netherlands net operating losses within the nine year carryforward period under netherlands tax law

fiscal year in fiscal years and  depreciation and amortization decreased by million and million  respectively  primarily due to lower intangibles amortization expense resulting from the april acquisition 
we amortized these intangible assets on an accelerated basis to reflect the pattern in which economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed

fiscal year  fiscal year vs 
fiscal year in fiscal years and  we incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  that followed operational reviews conducted after the april acquisition

income tax provision fiscal year vs 
fiscal year  fiscal year vs 
fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the increase in effective tax rate from the prior year was attributed to our establishment of a full valuation allowance against 
table of contents our us net deferred tax assets based on analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate is reduced by benefit attributable to foreign income taxed at lower rates and tax credits generated during the year 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
factors that impact our income tax provision include but are not limited to the mix of jurisdictional earnings  establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  and varying jurisdictional income tax rates that are applied 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the april acquisition  our predecessor s principal sources of liquidity were capital contributions from adp and cash generated from operations 
since the april acquisition  our principal sources of cash have included cash generated from operations  proceeds from our may initial public offering and bank borrowings 
our principal uses of cash have included debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
we expect that these will remain our principal uses of cash in the future  however  we may use cash to pursue additional acquisitions 
we expect our cash needs to service debt will decrease in future periods as a result of the application of proceeds from the refinancing transactions completed in conjunction with our initial public offering which were used to repay debt 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
in july  we acquired uc universal consulting software gmbh  a leading provider of software and services to collision repair facilities in germany for approximately million million 
we currently do not have any material pending agreements with respect to any other acquisition or strategic opportunity 
cash and cash equivalents as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we fund our operations  working capital and capital expenditures with our cash on hand and short term borrowings under our credit facility 
our cash on hand and short term borrowings vary significantly based on our cash flows as set forth below 
cash flows the following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented amount changed from fiscal years ended june  to to in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in the non cash adjustments  such as depreciation and amortization and loss on debt extinguishment  to reconcile net loss to cash  and by the changes in operating assets and liabilities

the million decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year included a decrease capital expenditures of million  consisting of computers  computer software  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  and a decrease due to the final working capital adjustment for the acquisition of csg 
financing activities 
the million increase in cash used in financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to fiscal year cash provided by our initial public offering which was partially offset by the reduction of debt and by fiscal year voluntary debt principal payments 
amended and restated senior credit facility in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility 
our amended and restated senior credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  a million us term loan and a million european term loan

our business does not experience any material level of seasonality

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we incur currency transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than our functional currency 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future 
a substantial portion of our revenues and costs are denominated in or effectively indexed to us dollars  but the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  british pounds  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other currencies 
historically  we have not undertaken hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition  however  we may decide this is necessary in the future 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in each of our foreign currencies versus the us dollar would have resulted in a million change to revenue on an annualized basis 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our revolving loan arrangement and term loans 
interest on these borrowings is based upon variable interest rates 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan arrangement and term loans during fiscal year was million and the weighted average interest rate in effect at june  was 
we terminated the interest rate collar related to our old senior credit agreement on december  based on the foregoing  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million change to our interest expense in fiscal year during fiscal year  we entered into two interest rate swaps with maturities on july  one swap had a notional amount of million and required us to pay a fixed rate of 
the other swap had a notional amount of million and required us to pay  on a quarterly basis  a fixed rate of 
these swaps had an estimated fair value of million as of june   and we recognized an increase in fair value of million during fiscal during fiscal year  we recognized net gains of million in other income related to these swaps  which were terminated on june  for a total cash settlement of million 
effective on june   we entered into three usd based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  million and million and maturities on june   which require us to pay fixed rates of  and  respectively 
we also entered into three euro based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  million  and million and maturities on june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
these interest rate swaps are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion on these cash flow hedges is recognized as other income expense 
the estimated fair values of million and million on usd based swaps and million million and million million on euro based swaps was recorded in other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  and  respectively 
the current year to date change  net of tax  in the fair value of these swaps of million reflects the effective portion of loss on these hedges and is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity
