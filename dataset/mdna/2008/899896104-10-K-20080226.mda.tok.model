gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to percent in compared with percent in and percent in margins in europe and beauty other increased slightly in compared with  primarily due to a favorable mix of products

margins in asia pacific and tupperware north america stayed flat during the higher gross margin percentage in compared with was due to the inclusion of a full year of the acquired units results  which run a slightly higher margin rate than the other units  as well as improvement in north america from the sale of previously written down product at a higher price  lower sales under incentive offers and lifo reserve liquidation

costs and expenses delivery  sales and administrative expense ds a as a percentage of sales was  and percent  in   and  respectively 
ds a as a percentage of sales decreased in compared with due to less amortization expense related to definite lived intangible assets of the acquired units

table of contents net interest expense the company incurred million of net interest expense in compared with million in in september  the company entered into an million five year senior secured credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility and million in term loans credit agreement 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to repay the company s previous credit agreement dated december   which was obtained in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition 
the previous agreement was then terminated 
as a result  million in deferred debt fees were written off and included in net interest expense for the year ended december  at the same time  the company settled certain floating to fixed interest rate swaps that were hedging the borrowings under the previous credit agreement  resulting in a termination payment of million that was also included in net interest expense for the new credit agreement provides for a lower interest rate spread and commitment fee compared with the company s previous agreement  which is expected to result in lower interest expense of about million over the five years from the new agreement s initiation  versus what would have been incurred under the previous agreement 
the company expects to realize approximately million of this benefit over the first months of the new agreement 
these charges were partially offset by a reduction in net interest expense incurred on the company s outstanding borrowings during reflecting a lower average debt level of million in compared with million in additionally  as more fully discussed in the market risk section  in the first quarter  the company entered into euro net equity hedges for the equivalent of million expiring at various points in and and a smaller amount of similar contracts denominated in japanese yen expiring in in addition to hedging the company s equity exposure to the euro and japanese yen falling in value versus the us dollar  the contracts also effectively converted this amount of the company s outstanding term debt from us dollars to the euro and japanese yen where the company generates cash flows 
the euro net hedge position was reduced by half in the third quarter of and the japanese yen hedge position was also reduced at that time 
as a result of relative interest rates among europe  japan and the united states  these contracts had a positive impact on net interest expense of about million for the year ended december  see additional discussion in liquidity and capital resources 
also contributing to the increase in net interest expense during was lower interest income compared with interest income during was million compared with million in  which included million earned from an escrow account funded in december at the time of the acquisition 
in order to discharge the company s million percent notes due in october  the company funded an escrow account with cash in december since the notes were paid off from the escrowed funds at the due date  the escrow account was closed and no further interest income has been earned 
the company incurred million of net interest expense in compared with million in increased interest expense in was driven largely by the higher level of borrowing that resulted from financing the acquisition in late the company s primary borrowing in was through term loans due in under its previous credit facility 
the company maintained a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts that reduced interest expense by approximately million in interest expense for included a make whole payment of million for the early retirement of the company s million notes in connection with entering into new financing arrangements for the acquisition and million for the discharge of obligations related to million of notes due in issuance costs of approximately million related to the retired debt were also written off as part of interest expense 
a credit of million to recognize net deferred gains on interest rate swaps related to these debt agreements that were previously closed offset some of this expense 
interest expense also included a million payment to close an interest rate hedge the company previously entered into to lock in the base interest rate on the previously expected refinancing of its notes 
as the company progressed toward closing the acquisition it became no longer probable in the third quarter of that the debt would be refinanced  and this agreement was no longer an effective hedge 

table of contents tax rate the effective tax rates for   and were  and percent  respectively 
the increase in the rate in largely reflected a lower level of foreign tax credit benefits  along with higher provisions for tax exposures 
the effective tax rates for and are below the us statutory rate reflecting the availability of excess foreign tax credits as well as lower foreign effective tax rates 
in  the company reached a settlement with its former parent company resulting in a cash receipt of million including interest  related to pre june tax liabilities 
this combined with lower foreign rates and foreign tax credits generated a net tax benefit of approximately million after considering amounts previously recorded as a receivable on the company s balance sheet and a provision for taxes related to the interest portion of the settlement 
this transaction  together with various audit settlements and year end tax planning transactions  resulted in the negative provision for income taxes for the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them 
the company does not record a valuation allowance where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits would ultimately be realized 
this assessment was based upon expectations of improving domestic operating results as well as anticipated gains related to the company s sales of land held for development near its orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
refer to the critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions of the company s methodology for evaluating deferred tax assets 
based on expected revenue and profit contributions of the company s various operations  management expects a tax rate several percentage points higher in compared with as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the requirements of fin and fsp fin  which the company implemented at the beginning of  has clarified guidance surrounding the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions  including the timing and effective settlement of those adjustments 
as of the end of  the company classified approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability  representing potential settlement of tax positions in one or more jurisdictions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
net income for  operating income showed substantial growth of percent compared with  due to improvements in all the company s segments led by significant increases by the tupperware brand segments  resulting from higher sales volume and improved capacity utilization  as well as million in lower amortization expense of definite lived intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition 
the company was also positively impacted by foreign currency changes primarily due to a stronger euro  australian dollar and russian ruble 
the higher profit from the segments also led to a million or percent  increase in net income versus this was despite an million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the third quarter of and million of interest expense recorded as a result of implementing the new credit agreement  which triggered the one time costs outlined previously 
as outlined previously  the company had various dispositions of property  plant and equipment and re engineering charges in  which in total were not significantly different in amount than similar items in for  net income was up compared with primarily due to the full year inclusion of the acquired units  which generated million in profit  or million before considering amortization of intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting  compared with million in for the one month they were owned by the company 
profit also improved in the tupperware units in asia pacific  there was a significantly lower 
table of contents loss by tupperware united states and canada  and a small improvement in profit by beauticontrol 
also impacting the comparison was higher unallocated corporate expenses  lower re engineering and impairment charges  and the large  favorable tax related settlement with the company s former parent outlined above 
international operations accounted for  and percent of the company s sales in  and  respectively

table of contents europe local currency sales increased four percent in the year ended  largely due to continued success in the emerging markets driven primarily by russia  south africa and turkey resulting from growth in the sales force and improved productivity 
russia s increase came partly from geographic expansion and tupperware south africa benefited from an additional independent management level to provide emphasis on recruiting and training sale force members team leader  which helped to grow the sale force 
emerging markets  those with a low or medium gdp per capita as reported by the world bank  accounted for million and million or percent and percent of net sales in this segment for and  respectively 
of the million emerging markets increase  million was from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these increases in local currency sales were offset by a double digit decrease in germany  the segment s largest business  resulting from a smaller sales force as recruiting of new sales force members has been below the company s objectives for several quarters 
in an effort to increase the sales force size  the team leader management level was added to the independent sales force structure in the fourth quarter of this  along with an improved new product program and product selection going forward  and an emphasis on enabling the sales force to recruit new party hostesses and thus reach new consumers is expected to ultimately lead to higher sales 
the trend did improve during the year  as there was a percent year over year increase in local currency sales in the fourth quarter  following double digit decreases in each of the first three quarters 
the total german sales force was smaller than the prior year by percent at the beginning of and percent at december  in and the german market accounted for million and million of the segment s sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   sales in the german market were positively impacted by million from a stronger euro versus the us dollar 
the sales decline in germany included a million decrease in business to business sales 
while the company actively pursues business to business opportunities  sales from this channel are based on reaching agreements with business partners and their product needs  along with consideration of how the arrangement will be integrated with the core party plan channel 
consequently  activity in one period may not be indicative of future periods 
for the entire segment  business to business sales were million for compared with sales of million for the euro was the main currency that led to the percentage point improvement in versus sales from stronger foreign currencies 
for  compared with  segment profit increased million and segment profit as a percentage of sales increased percentage points 
the higher segment profit was due to the higher sales in the emerging markets along with higher margins resulting from a favorable product mix 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in germany resulting from lower sales  and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts during  reflecting lower profitability by the company s independent distributors 
approximately half of the profit improvement in was from stronger foreign currencies  primarily the euro and russian ruble 
asia pacific asia pacific experienced substantial growth in with every business showing increased sales performance with the exception of the naturcare business in japan 
sales in the segment s emerging markets grew percent  led by china  indonesia and korea 
china s increase reflected more outlets in operation and higher productivity 
indonesia and korea benefited from larger and more productive sales forces  which were the result of successful promotions and product launches  including naturcare products in korea for the first time 
korea also maintained a high level of business to business sales 
the main sales increases among the segment s established markets were in australia and tupperware japan 
in australia  a modestly larger sales force was much more productive  reflecting the successful positioning of the 
table of contents earnings opportunity for the sale force and tupperware as a lifestyle brand 
the use of the team leader program to increase the number of sales force leaders also had a favorable impact 
in japan  the sales force grew significantly as the result of a successful shift in strategy to recruit many more customer representatives and to work to develop these members into sellers 
segment profit increased significantly compared with  reflecting the higher sales  a higher share of sales from australia which runs at a higher return on sales than the average for the segment and improved value chains in the tupperware and naturcare japan businesses  in part reflecting the consolidation of distribution facilities 
the positive impact from foreign currencies on the comparison of sales and profit with was most significantly from the australian dollar with smaller contributions from currencies in malaysia singapore  china and india 
tupperware north america all markets in the segment showed an increase in sales during compared with last year 
net sales in tupperware mexico increased percent which was in part due to an increase of million in business to business sales 
tupperware united states had a strong increase in sales during resulting from a higher active sales force  in part reflecting strong recruiting results 
the tupperware united states sales force at the end of was higher than the prior year by percent  although the segment as a whole ended the year with a percent decrease in sales force mainly due to lower recruiting by tupperware mexico 
overall  the company believes that the improvement in tupperware united states is directly related to the impact of the change to a multi tier sales force compensation structure that was completed in april of  as well as a strategy for expanded and enhanced sales force training 
this new compensation system provides for override commissions on group sales with an emphasis on the earnings opportunity and recruiting new sellers into the business 
this type of compensation system was also in use in some of the company s other businesses prior to its implementation by tupperware united states  and has since been implemented in additional businesses where the company believes its use is appropriate 
tupperware north america s profit increased million over coming from a sharp increase in profit in the united states and canadian businesses  which had losses in  as well as a substantial improvement in mexico 
this primarily reflected higher sales volume  along with improved capacity utilization and an improved cost structure 
also contributing was the consolidation of the bulk of canadian administrative activities with the united states 
offsetting these factors was the absence of the million benefit in from a reduction of the lifo inventory reserve 
beauty north america net sales on a local currency basis increased percent in compared with last year  resulting from improvement in both fuller mexico and beauticontrol north america 
in and  fuller mexico accounted for a large proportion of the segment s sales and profit 
sales at fuller mexico increased percent in local currency over last year 
this increase was the result of strong growth in its total and active sales forces as well as an increase in the average size of orders due to successful promotions and a positive response to new products 
the increase in sale force was driven mainly by an increase in recruiting as well as lower turnover rates achieved through successful incentive programs 
beauticontrol north america also contributed to the increase in segment sales for  due to a favorable sales force reception to an investment in merchandising programs designed to serve the dual purpose of reducing inventory levels and energizing the sales force 
the increase in local currency profit was due to the increase in sales volume as well as lower amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired of million compared with this improvement was partially 
table of contents offset by a decline in the gross margin percentage at beauticontrol north america resulting from an unfavorable mix and product pricing from the above mentioned investment  as well as incremental costs of operating in a larger manufacturing facility  to which the company moved into in the first quarter of and incremental distribution and freight costs 
fuller mexico had a slightly lower return on sales from the timing of certain promotional and incentive costs and a lower gross margin percentage resulting from outsourced production 
beauty other net local currency sales for the segment increased percent in over the strong performance in the segment was led by the central and south american businesses  most notably tupperware venezuela and tupperware brazil  reflecting higher active sales forces achieved through strong incentive and recruiting programs as well as improved pricing 
also contributing to the increase in sales was fuller philippines with a strong improvement over last year resulting from a higher active sales force  reflecting improved recruiting 
this was offset by lower sales levels in the nutrimetics businesses resulting from smaller active sales forces 
strategies have been implemented to drive sales force growth in these businesses with limited improvement in the sales force metrics to date 
the lower segment loss for of million compared with a loss of million in was primarily the result of the higher sales volume  favorable product mix resulting in improved gross margins and lower inventory write downs required in compared with also contributing to the improved results in was lower amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired of million 
strong foreign currencies had a percentage point positive impact on the sale comparison  which came primarily from the philippine peso and australian dollar 
the foreign exchange impact on the profit comparison was not significant

although local currency sales increased slightly  profit was down percent as reported and in local currency resulting in a decline of percentage points in return on sales 
the lower return on sales was driven by the decline in german sales which  despite the downturn  continue to carry a return above the segment average  and the mix of markets generating the profit  with a slight impact driven by the inclusion of a full year of results for the south african beauty units which operate at a lower return on sales

the improvement in sales  particularly in the second half of  was due to increased volume reflecting a year over year total and active sales force size advantage 
recruiting remained strong in with a spring campaign that was the second largest in beauticontrol s history 
the sales force growth continued to be fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy  replicable interactive party experience  the spa escape 
the sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with a slight improvement in gross margin driven by a better mix of sales 
these were partially offset by higher operating expenses for recruiting of sales force members and transition costs incurred for a new manufacturing facility at beauticontrol  as well as a full year of amortization related to intangible assets recorded in fuller mexico as part of the acquisition

the company made such optional prepayments in the fourth quarter of totaling million 
the agreement also requires additional principal payments consisting of percent of cash generated from certain asset sales  certain insurance proceeds and certain new debt issuances  as well as up to percent of excess cash flows 
excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  required debt payments and actual dividends paid up to million annually 
however  the credit agreement provides that cash may be used to repurchase shares using proceeds from stock option exercises and also repurchases beyond the use of option proceeds if the leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement is and will remain below times and the other covenants in the agreement are met

see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s credit agreement required it to maintain at least percent of its outstanding borrowings at a fixed rate for a period of at least three years in the future 
beginning in december and january  the company effectively converted million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps 
the swap agreements called for the company to receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor rate and pay a weighted average fixed rate of percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual basis point spread gave the company an all in effective rate of percent on these borrowings 
the swap agreements were scheduled to expire in through in order to maintain compliance with the three year requirement  in the second quarter of  the company terminated three swaps with a total notional value of million and purchased three new swaps with the same notional value that were to expire in following this action  all of the swaps were to expire in and a gain of million was realized on the termination of these agreements and was capitalized as a component of debt 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted above  in september the company entered into the credit agreement  replacing the credit agreement 
as a result  these swap arrangements were terminated in september resulting in a termination payment of million 
in connection with retiring the credit agreement  the million deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were fully recognized and both amounts were included as a component of net interest expense for the year ended december  as previously noted  the credit agreement also has a requirement that the company keep at least percent of total borrowings at a fixed interest rate for at least three years 
in september  the company entered into four new interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in under the terms of these new swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to the 
table of contents month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual spread dictated by the new credit agreement  of basis points as of december   gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on these borrowings at that date 
the credit agreement was entered into in conjunction with closing the acquisition that included a seven year million term loan bearing an annual interest rate of basis points over the libor rate and a million revolving credit facility 
this agreement replaced the company s then existing million revolving line of credit 
the company used cash on hand and the term loan borrowings to fund the amount due to sara lee corporation  to discharge its then outstanding million notes due in and to repay its million notes due in the settlement of the notes required make whole payments to the note holders of approximately million 
in anticipation of this transaction  the company closed fixed to variable interest rate swaps with combined notional amounts totaling million that were scheduled to expire in with the notes 
these swaps were entered to convert the company s million notes from fixed to variable interest rates 
closing these swaps resulted in a loss of approximately million that was recorded as a component of income when the notes were settled 
the company also exited an agreement to lock in a fixed year treasury rate that was to provide the base interest for an anticipated refinancing of its million notes 
the million cost to exit this arrangement was recorded as a component of interest expense in the third quarter of in addition to the amounts discussed above  upon closure of the transaction  the company expensed unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the settled debt totaling approximately million and recognized deferred net gains related to previously terminated hedging arrangements associated with the settled debt 
these net gains were million 
the million term loan was reduced to million at the end of  and principal payments made during further reduced the balance to million as of december  due to prepayments made in the fourth quarter of  the company had no scheduled payments in however  the company made voluntary payments of million and mandatory payments of million 
the mandatory payments were a result of the sale of land in the orlando  florida area 
prior to entering into the credit agreement  the company had made million in voluntary payments and million in mandatory payments with proceeds from the sale of land in orlando  florida  sale of other excess land and insurance settlements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made an additional voluntary payment of million on the credit agreement reducing the company s balance on these borrowings to million at the end of the company s two debt rating agencies  standard and poor s and moody s  have both rated the company 
standard and poor s currently rates the corporate credit rating of the company bb and assigns a stable outlook 
it currently has rated the company s credit agreement as bbb 
moody s assigns a rating of ba to the corporate family rating of the company 
as of december   the company had million available under its revolving line of credit and million available under other uncommitted lines of credit  along with a cash balance of million 
current and committed borrowing facilities and cash generated by operating activities are expected to be adequate to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
the company s major markets for its products are australia  france  germany  japan  mexico  the philippines  russia  south africa and the united states 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets would adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
the previously discussed downturn in the company s german business has impacted its ability to contribute the same historical level of operating cash flows to the company 
however  this has not resulted in a material negative impact to the company as a whole 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force  the success of new products and promotional programs 
included in the cash balance of million reported at the end of was million denominated in venezuela bolivars 
the balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market 
due 
table of contents to venezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates  the company can not immediately repatriate this cash at the exchange rate used to translate the venezuelan bolivars into us dollars for inclusion on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has applied to transfer approximately million of such amount out of the country 
the company believes it could immediately repatriate the cash from venezuela  but it would only currently be able to do so at an exchange rate that would be about percent less favorable 
this would result in the company having fewer us dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its consolidated income statement 
the debt to total capital ratio at the end of was percent compared with percent at the end of debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity 
the decrease in debt from the same period a year ago reflected the debt principal payments made from cash generated from operating activities and from the sale of real estate and other assets 
the increase in equity resulted largely from earnings in  reduced by dividends paid during the year  plus positive foreign currency translation adjustments net of hedge losses 
in december the company experienced a fire at its tupperware united states manufacturing and distribution facility in south carolina  causing a total loss of its main finished goods warehouse 
the company is covered by insurance for this loss  and while it cannot at this time accurately estimate the amount of claim proceeds it will receive  it believes the settlement of the claim will not result in a loss to the company 
as of december   the company included on its consolidated balance sheet a miscellaneous receivable of million that represented the book value of the inventory and property lost  other costs incurred that are expected to be recovered through the insurance claim  and its deductible  net of million in proceeds that had already been received from its insurers 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in net income was million higher in than in among the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities  the most important net difference between years was the higher non cash impact in of re engineering  impairment costs and loss on disposal  mainly due to the impairment of nutrimetics goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in addition to the write off and amortization of deferred loan fees and a higher provision for bad debts 
the most significant year over year variations in changes in assets and liabilities were outflows for higher inventory notwithstanding the days sales in inventory at the end of was slightly better than the end of  offset from a larger increase in in accounts payable and accruals  most notably from higher compensation accruals largely for management incentives and the timing of certain non income tax payables 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in compared with million in the increase reflected higher cash pretax income  excluding land sales  of close to million  along with a cash inflow from higher payables and accruals in as opposed to an outflow in the improvement in payables and accruals was largely due to the management of the timing of payments and the volume of business in certain markets 
there were also smaller improvements in inventory from the sale of slow moving items in certain markets and in non trade receivables reflecting lower non income tax related receivables and amounts relating to hedging transactions 
the main offsets were from cash tax payments of million in versus net receipts of million in that included a million receipt from the company s former parent 
there was also an outflow from trade receivables in  versus an inflow in  reflecting higher december sales in certain markets  as well as higher past due amounts 
investing activities for  and  the company spent million  million and million respectively  for capital expenditures 
the most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products with 
table of contents the greatest amount spent in europe 
the slightly higher capital expenditure balance in was primarily due to higher spending on improvements made for capacity expansion at beauticontrol north america 
in addition to cash outlays for property  plant and equipment  the company also had non cash additions through capital leases of million and million in and  respectively  primarily related to the construction of a new center of excellence manufacturing facility that replaced an existing facility in belgium 
partially offsetting the capital spending were million in  million in and million in  of proceeds related to the sale of certain property  plant and equipment and insurance settlements 
in  the company received million in proceeds from insurance recoveries relating to the fire at a former manufacturing facility in tennessee and partial insurance proceeds from the fire at the company s facility in south carolina

additionally  and included net cash outflows of million and million  respectively  in connection with the acquisition 
financing activities the primary financing activities were the net proceeds from credit agreement of million which were used to repay borrowings under the company s credit agreement entered into to fund the acquisition 
the refinancing completed in  together with the principal payments made on the company s term debt resulted in total repayments of million in compared with repayments of million in see detailed discussion in liquidity and capital resources including settlement of historical debt and related covenant restrictions 
dividends during  and  the company paid dividends of per share of common stock totaling million  million and million  respectively 
while the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis  in the absence of a significant event requiring cash  the company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operating activities as well as additional property sales are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the company s ability to finance its operations  make necessary investments in the future growth of the business or its near term debt repayment obligations 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout 
stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million respectively  related to the exercise of outstanding stock options 
the increase in stock option proceeds during was due primarily to an increase in the company s stock price and options that would have otherwise expired during this period providing incentive for option holders to exercise their outstanding options 
the corresponding shares were issued out of the company s balance held in treasury

the company intends to use proceeds from stock option exercises to offset a portion of the dilution that would otherwise result from these exercises 
during the company repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  for this risk the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of this total  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to expiration based upon an increase in domestic income from beauticontrol north america as well as expected improvement in the 
table of contents tupperware united states business 
also  expected gains related to the company s previously discussed orlando land sales activities will result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
in  the company adopted the provisions of fin  which addresses whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin requires increased disclosures  provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes and the accounting in interim periods 
as a result of the adoption  a adjustment of million to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions was recognized with a corresponding decrease in the opening retained earnings balance 
as of december  and the beginning of fiscal  the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and the beginning of fiscal  respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million for the year ended december  the company is currently under tax audit for a number of periods and in a number of jurisdictions and anticipates some of the audits may conclude within the next months 
as of the end of  the company classified approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability  representing potential settlement of tax positions 
in addition  the company anticipates some additional audits may conclude within the next months 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events  if any  on its uncertain tax positions recorded as of the end of it is also reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions as well as additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like the promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at a time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
valuation of goodwill the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october  and the acquired units in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the acquired units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to 
table of contents believe that a triggering event for impairment may have occurred  a test would be completed at that time 
the valuation of goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of beauticontrol s operations both in north america and internationally and the operations of the acquired units 
the company estimates the fair value of beauticontrol and the acquired units operations using discounted future cash flow estimates 
such a valuation requires the company to make significant estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates in allocating the goodwill to the different segments that include beauticontrol operations beauty north america  asia pacific  tupperware north america  and beauty other and the acquired units operations europe  asia pacific  beauty north america and beauty other 
lastly  it requires estimates as to the appropriate discounting rates to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the results of the reviews conducted to date for the beauticontrol goodwill acquired in october indicated fair values in excess of the carrying value 
the company completed the annual review of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of the acquired units in the third quarter of based upon this evaluation  the company deemed the nutrimetics reporting unit to be impaired  resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million related to the goodwill balance 
the results of the third quarter review of the remaining acquired units indicated fair values in excess of carrying value 
given the sensitivity of the valuation of the reporting units to changes in the estimated future cash flows to be generated from those reporting units  versus the estimate  when the valuation is performed a reduction in the estimated future cash flows for the nutrimetics reporting unit would likely result in an additional impairment charge  and a reduction in the assumed future cash flows of percent for naturcare and a significant percentage change for the acquired units in the avroy shlain  swissgarde and fuller reporting units would also likely result in an impairment charge 
goodwill included on the december  consolidated balance sheet associated with the acquired units was million for the fuller reporting unit  million for the nutrimetics reporting unit  million for the naturcare reporting unit and million for the avroy shlain and swissgarde reporting unit 
impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the company s debt covenants  although the financial covenant directly affected is the minimum net worth requirement and the first million of any impairment arising from july  forward is excluded from the calculation of compliance with this covenant 
other intangible assets the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and trade names in conjunction with its purchase of the acquired units with an ending balance of million and million in and  respectively 
of the ending balance  million related to fuller  million to nutrimetics  million to naturcare  million to avroy shlain and swissgarde  and million to nuvo 
these amounts have indefinite lives and are evaluated for impairment as discussed in the goodwill valuation above and fluctuate based on changes in exchange rates and any impairment charges recorded 
the company completed the annual review of these indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter of based upon the evaluation  the company recorded a million impairment related to the nutrimetics trade name 
there was no impairment of the nutrimetics trade name based on the evaluation  nor did the or evaluations of the intangible assets associated with the other reporting units indicate fair values were below the carrying value 
as noted above  the annual review of the indefinite lived intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows with these assets 
changes in estimated future cash flows of the company s reporting units  similar to those described above  would impact the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets 

table of contents additionally  the company recorded million for valuation of the acquired units sales forces  and million for product formulations 
the estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
retirement obligations the company s employee pension and other post employment benefits health care costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the health care cost trend assumptions are based upon historical results  the near term outlook and an assessment of long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s historical experience and outlook 
the long term return on plan assets are based upon historical results of the plans and investment market overall  as well as the company s belief as to the future returns to be earned over the life of the plans 
the discount rate is based upon current yields of aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
the company s key assumptions and funding expectations are indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of the company amended its domestic retiree medical plan effective april  prior to the effective date but after january   the company subsidized the cost of health care for retirees based on age and years of service 
for under age retirees  the amendment altered the company s contribution from a percent of cost to a fixed amount 
for over age retirees  the amendment lowered the fixed subsidy amount 
for former associates retired prior to january  and under the age of  the amendment introduced a monthly premium charge of per covered adult 
the change resulted in a decrease of expense of million and million in and effective december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employer s balance sheet date 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company accounted for its defined benefit post retirement plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
sfas no 
required that the liability recorded represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through its accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for  the company increased its health care cost trend rate to percent for all participants grading down to percent in this change represented an increase of one percentage point for post age participants and three percentage points for pre age participants 
as a result  pretax expense related to the company s post employment health care plan increased approximately million 
unrecognized losses on post employment plans as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements are not expected to result in a material increase of pretax expense as compared with that of 
table of contents effective june   the company froze the accrual of benefits to participants under its domestic defined benefit pension plans 
this action necessitated a re measurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax increase of million million after tax 
this change resulted in the elimination of the service cost component of net periodic pension expense as it relates to these plans and an ongoing annual reduction of approximately million  or about million as compared with due to an excess of lump sum retirement distributions from its domestic pension plans as compared with service and interest costs  the company recorded a settlement charge of approximately million in in conjunction with the benefit freeze  the company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from percent of eligible employee compensation up to the social security wage base to percent 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent directors or distributors or a member of its independent sales force and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation for these awards  the company is also required to approximate the number of options that will be forfeited prior to completing their vesting requirement forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
impact of inflation inflation as measured by consumer price indices has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates 
new accounting pronouncements refer to discussion of new accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  and the currencies in which it borrows 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s current credit agreement carries a variable interest rate  but requires the company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least percent of total debt during the term of the loan  which is consistent with the terms of the company s previous credit agreement 
in september  the company entered into four new interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in under the terms of these new swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to 
table of contents the month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent 
the swap agreements combined with a contractual spread dictated by the new credit agreement  and currently basis points  gave the company an all in effective rate of about percent on these borrowings as of the end of on november   the company entered into four forward interest rate agreements that fix the borrowing rate for an additional million under the september term loan agreement for these agreements locked in the libor base rate for these borrowings at the forward rates then existing for the month borrowing periods beginning at the end of december and at the end of the first three quarters of the average locked in libor rate was about percent 
the company will incur this rate on the million of borrowings plus the spread under the credit agreement  which was basis points at the end of the above interest rate swaps entered into in  effectively fixed the interest rates on million of the company s debt decreasing the company s exposure from the impact of interest rate changes 
if short term interest rates varied by percent the company s annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately million  with all other variables remaining constant 
a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its japanese yen net equity and euro net equity through a series of new forward contracts 
at initiation  the company sold japanese yen and bought forward million and sold euro and bought forward million 
these equity hedges also effectively converted portions of the company s us dollar debt obligations to japanese yen and euro where operating cash flow is generated 
the initial forward contracts matured  or will mature  in and and will be settled in cash such that the company is exposed to fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the us dollar 
as of december   the company had reduced its japanese yen position by million and its euro position by million 
receipts or payments under the hedges are expected to be partially offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in japanese yen and in euro 
during the first quarter of  in order to protect the value of a portion of the company s euro based cash flows expected during  the company purchased a series of put options that expired at various points during  giving the company the right  but not the obligation  to sell million euros in exchange for us dollars 
the put options had a weighted average strike price of about dollars per euro 
the company paid premiums for these put options totaling million 
although the company considered these put options to be a 
table of contents hedge of its exposure to changes in the value of the euro  they did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accordingly  the value of the options was marked to market at the end of each quarter of  and any change in value was recorded in other income or expense as applicable 
for the year ended december   million of expense was recorded based on the change in the market value of the options 
all options expired unexercised 
while the company s hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries  its cash flow hedges  and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
the us dollar equivalent of the company s most significant net open hedge positions as of december  were to sell swiss francs million  japanese yen million  and russian rubles million  and to buy mexican pesos million  south african rand million  and korean won million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company s outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net payable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which upon settlement could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow 
when excluding the impact of the forward points in this analysis  the company was in a net payable position of approximately million from the portfolio of forward contracts 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 
based on the company s net open hedge positions in place at december   and interest rates in those countries compared with us interest rates  the company received an annualized net benefit in net interest expense of million for the year ended december  the company does not expect a material impact to net interest expense in resulting from these hedges 
a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of tupperware products  and approximately million of resin cost was included in cost of sales in a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin could therefore impact the company s annual cost of sales in the million dollar range as compared with the prior year 
the company manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of what it perceives to be favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering forward contracts for resin prices is not cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process 
included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals  the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial developments in the orlando real estate market  obtaining financing and general economic conditions  such as interest rate increases 
the company s land sale program was negatively impacted in due the mortgage credit crisis in the united states which is expected to delay the completion of the program 
the company had previously foreseen completing this program in
