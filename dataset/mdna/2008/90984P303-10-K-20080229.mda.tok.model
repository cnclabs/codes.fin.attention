item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to provide insight into the financial condition and results of operations of united and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
net income was million in  a decrease of from the million earned in diluted earnings per common share was for  compared with for  a decrease of 
the decrease from was primarily due to a more challenging economic environment that resulted in a higher provision for loan losses  a decline in the net interest margin and a special fraud related provision for loan losses resulting from the failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina 
because the special provision for fraud related losses was considered by management to be an isolated and nonrecurring event  management s discussion will primarily refer to operating earnings and performance measures which exclude those fraud related losses 
management believes that the presentation of operating earnings provides a meaningful basis for analyzing underlying performance trends 
a reconciliation of operating earnings measures to earnings measures prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap is shown in table on page of this report 
net operating income was million in and was level with the million earned in diluted operating earnings per common share was for  compared with for  a decrease of 
operating return on tangible equity for was  compared with for operating return on assets for was 
as compared to in earnings for were influenced by a sharp decline in loan demand  particularly in the residential construction and housing markets 
this began with problems in sub prime lending early in the year 
although united does not participate in sub prime lending  the slowdown in the housing market resulted in a buildup of finished home inventory as well as a surplus of finished lot inventory  particularly in the atlanta region market 
this put stress on many residential real estate builders and developers who depend on an active housing market to sell their inventories 
as a result  loan demand was down significantly in and united saw a sharp increase in credit losses 
the soft housing market also affected deposit pricing as large mortgage banks  and local community banks  needing liquidity  aggressively competed for certificates of deposit  driving rates significantly above wholesale borrowings with similar terms 
competitive deposit pricing and the carrying cost of a larger base of nonperforming assets compressed the net interest margin basis points to  further affecting earnings 
the economic environment in was in sharp contrast to earnings for were influenced by strong loan and deposit growth and rising interest rates that allowed us to engage in significant de novo branch expansion 
the net interest margin increased basis points to  as rising interest rates had a positive effect on united s slightly asset sensitive balance sheet 
the local economies in united s markets were strong  contributing to the strong loan growth 
for  taxable equivalent net interest revenue of million was up million  or  from  primarily due to the acquisitions of gwinnett commercial group and southern bancorp and strong loan growth during in  loan growth slowed substantially leaving loans  absent the gwinnett commercial group acquisition  only slightly above the level at december  as a result of the soft housing market  credit quality measures showed deterioration in net charge offs  excluding million fraud related spruce pine lot loans  were million compared with million in the weakening credit conditions resulted in a provision for loan losses of million  excluding the million provision related to the spruce pine lot loans  compared with million in at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was compared with at the end of nonperforming assets  which includes nonaccrual loans  loans past due more than days and foreclosed real estate but excluding nonperforming assets related to spruce pine  were up million from while loans increased million over the same period  primarily due to the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group 
at december   such nonperforming assets represented 
of total assets compared with 
at the end of net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were  excluding million related to the spruce pine lot loans  compared with 
for despite the challenging economic environment  fee revenue showed strong growth in fee revenue in increased million  or  from although securities gains  net of losses from the prepayment of borrowings contributed to the increase  these balance sheet management activities represented only million of the increase 
increases occurred in every category with consulting fees and brokerage fees both achieving record levels 
also contributing to the increase in fee revenue was a million investment in bank owned life insurance boli in april that added million to other fee revenue 
operating expenses of million were up million  or  from the increase resulted primarily from the acquisitions of gwinnett commercial group in june and southern bancorp in december  continued de novo expansion  higher write downs and losses on other real estate and the new fdic insurance assessments 
of the total million increase in operating expenses  the two acquisitions accounted for approximately million  higher losses on other real estate accounted for approximately million and the new fdic assessments were responsible for million of the increase 
in  and  united opened five  eight  and seven locations  respectively  resulting in higher staff  occupancy and equipment costs 
in june  united completed the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiary  first bank of the south 
the company exchanged  shares of its common stock with a value of approximately million and million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of gwinnett commercial group 
the assets of first bank of the south  including purchase accounting adjustments  totaled million  and were included in united s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united and its subsidiaries are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon future events 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record the valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies for united are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements 
management considers the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses and intangible assets to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on non impaired loans based on historical loss experience  management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component and an unallocated component 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimate pursuant to either statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a grade seven and on the watch list 
these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the historical loss element is determined using the average of actual losses incurred over the prior two years for each type of loan 
the historical loss experience is adjusted for known changes in economic conditions and credit quality trends such as changes in the amount of past due and nonperforming loans 
the resulting loss allocation factors are applied to the balance of each type of loan after removing the balance of impaired loans and other specifically allocated loans from each category 
the loss allocation factors are updated annually 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations of credit and changes in portfolio mix 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss estimation based on historical loss experience as a result of united s growth through acquisitions  which have expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates  and changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical losses used in developing loss allocation factors may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its processes for determining the allowance adequately consider all the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
additional information on united s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses can be found in the sections of management s discussion and analysis titled asset quality and risk elements and nonperforming assets and in the sections of part i  item titled lending policy and loan review and non performing assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes additional information on united s accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses 
intangible assets united s intangible assets consist primarily of excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles 
united s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of excess purchase price 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value 
these changes or factors  when they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could affect the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value 
these events or circumstances  when they occur  could be material to united s operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential effect cannot be reasonably estimated 
mergers and acquisitions as part of its balanced growth strategy  united selectively engages in evaluation of strategic partnerships 
mergers and acquisitions present opportunities to enter new markets with an established presence and a capable management team already in place 
united employs certain criteria to ensure that any merger or acquisition candidate meets strategic growth and earnings objectives that will build future franchise value for shareholders 
additionally  the criteria include ensuring that management of a potential partner shares united s community banking philosophy of premium service quality and operates in attractive  high growth markets with excellent opportunities for further organic growth 
as part of this strategy  united completed one bank merger in and one bank merger and two branch acquisitions in united will continue to evaluate potential transactions as they are presented 
on june   united completed the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group  inc gwinnett  a bank holding company headquartered in lawrenceville  georgia  and its wholly owned subsidiary first bank of the south 
on june   gwinnett had assets totaling million  including purchase accounting related intangibles 
united exchanged  shares of its common stock valued at million and million in cash for all of the outstanding shares 
first bank of the south was merged into the bank and operates as a separate community bank  united community bank gwinnett 
on december   united completed the acquisition of southern bancorp  inc southern  a bank holding company headquartered in marietta  georgia  and its wholly owned subsidiary southern national bank 
on december   southern had assets totaling million  including purchase accounting related intangibles 
united exchanged  shares of its common stock valued at million for all of the outstanding shares 
southern national bank was merged into the bank 
the cobb county location is now included with united community bank metro  and the cherokee county location operates as a separate community bank  united community bank cherokee 
on september   united completed the acquisition of two western north carolina banking locations in sylva and bryson city 
these offices were acquired from another financial institution  and had million in loans and million in deposits on the date they were acquired 
united paid a premium for these branches of approximately of deposits 
both of these offices are located in markets where united has a presence and are natural extensions of its existing franchise 
operating results much of the discussion contained in this report is presented on an operating basis 
the presentation of operating earnings excludes an million fraud loss provision recorded in and merger related charges in and that are considered non recurring 
the presentation of operating earnings is therefore not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in june  the north carolina attorney general obtained a receiver to take custody of the assets of the developers of two failed real estate developments near spruce pine  north carolina  citing possible fraud on the part of the developers 
united had loans to individual borrowers totaling million secured by undeveloped lots in these developments 
united was one of twelve banks that had loaned money to borrowers to finance the purchase of lots 
the loans were made to appropriately qualified borrowers in accordance with our standard underwriting procedures 
at the time the loans were made  we were not aware that most of the borrowers were simultaneously obtaining loans for additional lots at other banks and thereby taking on debt possibly beyond their repayment ability 
we were also unaware that the borrowers down payments were not paid in cash as indicated on the closing documents  but were financed by a second mortgage from the developer and that the developer agreed to service the borrowers debts 
we also subsequently learned that the appraisals relied upon in the underwriting process had been inflated by using comparable sales that were not at arms length to persons related to the developer and that many of the lots were subdivided into parcels that are too small to be used for their intended purpose 
united recognized a provision for fraud related loan losses of million in related to these loans and charged off an equal amount of loans 
the special provision reduced net income by million and reduced diluted earnings per share by 
in merger related charges in and related to the acquisitions of gwinnett  southern and the two north carolina branches were insignificant and are therefore not shown separately 
pre tax merger related charges of 
million and million were incurred in and  respectively 
these charges decreased net income by 
million and million and diluted earnings per share by 
and  respectively  for and management included non gaap net operating income because it believes it is useful for evaluating united s operations and performance over periods of time  as well as in managing and evaluating united s business and in discussions about united s operations and performance 
net operating income excludes the pre tax effect of the special million fraud related provision for loan losses in and the merger related charges in and because management believes that the circumstances leading to the provision and such charges were isolated  non recurring events and do not reflect overall trends in united s earnings and financial performance 
management believes this non gaap net operating income provides users of united s financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing united s financial results and credit trends  as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods 
the following is a reconciliation of net operating income to gaap net income

net interest revenue taxable equivalent net interest revenue the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities is the single largest component of united s revenue 
united actively manages this revenue source to provide an optimal level of revenue while balancing interest rate  credit  and liquidity risks 
net interest revenue totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the level recorded in net interest revenue for increased million  or  over the level 
the main drivers of the increase in net interest revenue for were loan growth due to the acquisition of gwinnett in june   the acquisition of southern national in december and core loan growth during average loans increased million  or  from last year 
the average yield on loans increased basis points reflecting the rising prime lending rate through june   on united s predominantly prime based loan portfolio 
year end loan balances increased million from  resulting in a growth rate 
this growth includes million from the acquisition of gwinnett 
core loan growth slowed substantially in reflecting weakness in the housing market  particularly in the atlanta region 
aside from the atlanta region  loan growth continued in our other markets  although at a slower pace than in prior years 
excluding the acquisition of gwinnett  loan volume in the atlanta region was down million from in our other markets of north georgia  western north carolina  east tennessee and coastal georgia  loans were up million  million  million and million  respectively 
average interest earning assets for the year increased billion  or  over the increase reflects the acquisitions and core loan growth in  as well as a increase in the investment securities portfolio 
the majority of the increase in interest earning assets was funded by interest bearing sources  as the increase in average interest bearing liabilities for the year was billion over the average yield on interest earning assets for was up from in reflecting the effect of higher short term interest rates on united s prime based loans 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue  which are the interest rate spread and the net interest margin 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the effect of non interest bearing deposits and other non interest bearing funding sources and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company s investments  and is defined as net interest revenue as a percentage of total average interest earning assets which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest earning assets with customers non interest bearing deposits and with stockholders equity 
for  and  united s net interest spread was  and  respectively  while the net interest margin was  and  respectively 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread fell in due to the increase in nonperforming assets  aggressive competitive pricing for deposits and the effect of the federal reserve s action in lowering short term rates in the second half of on united s slightly asset sensitive balance sheet 
during most of the second half of  there was an imbalance between libor and retail certificate of deposit cd rates  which did not allow us to lower cd rates proportionately with the fed rate movements 
this contributed to our margin compression in in  united was able to significantly increase its liquidity by gathering cds at rates below comparable wholesale borrowings 
because united entered into with excess liquidity  we were able to avoid some of the aggressive cd pricing  and related margin compression  by allowing higher priced  non relationship cds to leave the bank in favor of lower priced wholesale borrowings 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities for was  up from  reflecting the effect of rising rates on united s floating rate liabilities  higher deposit pricing and a changing deposit mix with a higher portion of our overall funding coming from interest bearing sources

provision for loan losses excluding the million special provision for fraud related loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in  compared with million in and million in as a percentage of average outstanding loans  the provision was  
and  respectively  in  and the ratio of net loan charge offs to average outstanding loans for  excluding the million in fraud related charge offs  was  compared with 
for and 
for the provision for loan losses for each year is the amount management believes is necessary to position the allowance for loan losses at an amount adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in reflects the weak housing market and its effect on united s residential construction portfolio  primarily in the atlanta region market 
the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and the corresponding analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
additional discussions on loan quality and the allowance for loan losses are included in the asset quality section of this report  note to the consolidated financial statements  and above in the critical accounting policies section of this report

earnings for acquired companies are included in consolidated earnings after their respective acquisition dates 
service charges and fees of million were up million  or  from this increase was primarily due to growth in transactions and new accounts from our core deposit programs  growth in fees on deposit accounts  and cross selling of other products and services 
the growth in the number of accounts and higher transaction activity was reflected in the increase in atm and debit card revenue that was up million  or from with the growth in the customer base  service charges and fees on deposit accounts for increased from mortgage loan and related fees of million were up million  or  from in  united closed  mortgage loans totaling million compared with  loans totaling million in substantially all these originated residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market  including the right to service the loans 
consulting fees of million were up million  or  from the increase was primarily due to the continued growth in risk management and strategic bank assessment services practices at our brintech subsidiary 
brokerage fees increased million  or from the increase in brokerage fees for each year was due to strong market activity and growth in customers  particularly from k rollovers 
united incurred net securities gains of million during  which resulted from balance sheet management activities 
the securities gains allowed us to reduce our long term borrowing costs by prepaying a federal home loan bank advance 
in  similar balance sheet management activities resulted in  in net securities losses  and  in losses from the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances 
other fee revenue of million increased million  or  from the increase was primarily due to an additional investment in boli 
in april  united purchased million in boli which added million to other fee revenue in operating expense operating expenses were million in as compared to million in and million in the following table presents the components of operating expenses

this affects year over year expense comparisons in the year an acquisition is completed and the year immediately following the acquisition 
in order to assist in understanding the core expense growth trends  operating expense explanations in this section include an estimate for the amount of the increase related to acquisitions where it is possible to reasonably quantify the amount 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from acquisitions accounted for approximately of the increase  or million 
the balance of the increase was due to an increase in staff to support de novo business growth and related hiring costs  higher brokerage and mortgage incentives and higher health care costs 
at december   total staff was  an increase of from acquisitions account for staff members  and de novo expansion accounts for additional staff members 
communication and equipment expense for was million  an increase of  or  from the increase was primarily due to higher maintenance and depreciation costs resulting from united s purchase of southern in december  and gwinnett in june  and a continued commitment to technology and telecommunications equipment to enhance customer service and support business growth 
occupancy expense for was million  an increase of million  or  from the majority of this increase was the result of higher facilities costs and maintenance expenses resulting from additional banking offices added through the acquisitions of southern and gwinnett and further de novo expansion 
advertising and public relations expense for was million  a decrease of  or  from due to efforts to control discretionary spending 
postage  printing and supplies expense for was million  an increase of  or  from most of this increase was due to additional postage and courier expenses resulting from business growth  including new customers and locations which were the result of the acquisitions of southern and gwinnett 
professional fees were million for  an increase of million  or from primarily due to higher legal costs associated with loan workouts and corporate initiatives 
higher costs of outsourced services also contributed to the increase 
other expenses were million for  an increase of million  or  from losses and expenses on foreclosed properties accounted for approximately million of the increase and the new fdic insurance assessments accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the efficiency ratio measures total operating expenses excluding merger related charges  as a percentage of total revenue excluding the provision for loan losses and net securities gains or losses 
based on operating income  united s efficiency ratio for was  compared with for and for the slight increase in was the result of compression in our net interest margin 
however  the increase was kept in line by united s continued discipline in managing expenses 
income taxes income tax expense  including tax benefits relating to merger charges  was million in  compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates as a percentage of pre tax net income were  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate has increased over the years as tax exempt interest revenue on securities and loans has declined as a percentage of pre tax earnings

additional information regarding income taxes  including a reconciliation of the differences between the recorded income tax provision and the amount of income tax computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fourth quarter discussion taxable equivalent net interest revenue for the fourth quarter of rose million  or  to million from the same period a year ago with loan and deposit growth from acquisitions accounting for most of the increase 
year over year loan growth  excluding acquisitions  has been relatively flat with loans at december  up million from the net interest margin decreased basis points from the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of several factors led to the margin compression including the higher balance of nonperforming assets and competitive pricing pressures on deposits 
the fourth quarter provision for loan losses  excluding million related to the spruce pine lot loans  was million  up million from a year earlier 
non performing assets totaled million  up million from a year ago 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 
at december   compared with 
at december  fee revenue of million grew million  or  from million for the fourth quarter of service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased million  or  to million  primarily due to higher atm and debit card usage fees and growth in transactions and new accounts from core deposit programs 
mortgage fees decreased  or  to million due to decreased demand during the fourth quarter reflecting the continued softness in the housing market 
united closed million in mortgage loans in the fourth quarter of compared with million for the fourth quarter of consulting fees were up  or percent  to million from a year ago reflecting strong growth in the risk management and advisory services practices 
united recognized securities gains of million in the fourth quarter  up million from the loss recognized in the fourth quarter the gain was offset by a loss of million from the prepayment of federal home loan bank advances 
the two transactions were part of the same balance sheet management initiative to reduce funding costs 
operating expenses increased million to million  a increase from the fourth quarter of the acquisitions of southern and gwinnett added approximately million to fourth quarter expenses 
salaries and employee benefit costs of million increased  or  from the fourth quarter of this increase resulted from increases in staff to support our de novo expansion activities as well as higher health care costs 
the two acquisitions added approximately million in staff costs 
these costs were offset by an adjustment to bonus and profit sharing expense that reduced fourth quarter staff costs million 
communications and equipment expenses decreased  to million 
occupancy expense increased  to million reflecting the increase in cost to operate additional banking offices 
postage  printing and supplies expense decreased  to million 
professional fees increased  to million reflecting higher legal expenses associated with loan workouts and the cost of various corporate initiatives 
other operating expense increased million to million primarily due to approximately million in write downs and expenses on foreclosed properties and  resulting from the new fdic insurance assessments

in  united experienced strong loan growth in all markets  with particular strength in loans secured by real estate  both residential and non residential 
in  the softening housing market resulted in a much more challenging lending environment and fewer acceptable lending opportunities 
the weak housing market mostly affected our residential construction portfolio  which was down million from the end of  when acquisitions are excluded

the amount each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies and other credit quality trends  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral  and economic factors and trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed by united s credit administration through analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews of non performing loans  past due loans and larger credits are designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses  as well as to determine the adequacy of the allowance and are conducted on a regular basis during the year 
these reviews are performed by the responsible lending officers  a separate loan review function or the special assets department with consideration of such factors as the customer s financial position  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and other pertinent factors 
the following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years 
table allowance for loan losses years ended december  in thousands balance beginning of period provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses acquired from subsidiaries at merger date charge offs commercial commercial and industrial commercial secured by real estate commercial construction residential construction residential mortgage installment total loans charged off recoveries commercial commercial and industrial commercial secured by real estate commercial construction residential construction residential mortgage installment total recoveries net charge offs balance end of period total loans at year end average allowance as a percentage of year end loans as a percentage of average loans net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance as a percentage of non performing loans management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate and appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of united  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant such additions 
see the critical accounting policies section for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical data  subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in united s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
consequently  management believes that the unallocated allowance appropriately reflects probable inherent but undetected losses in the loan portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years

at december  and  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 
and  respectively 
non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate  totaled million at december   compared with million at year end united s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the principal and interest on a loan is not likely to be repaid in accordance with the loan terms or when the loan becomes days past due and is not both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest revenue 
generally  interest revenue on a non accrual loan is recognized on a cash basis as payments are received if the collateral value sufficiently covers the loan balance 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were on non accrual status at december  the table below summarizes non performing assets at year end for the last five years

specific reserves allocated to these impaired loans totaled million on december  and million on december  the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
united s policy is to discontinue the recognition of interest revenue for loans classified as impaired under sfas no 
when the loan meets the criteria for nonaccrual status 
investment securities the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects united s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of revenue 
the securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale increased million from the end of united continued to purchase securities through as part of a continuing program to help stabilize the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet  to increase net interest revenue and to replace maturing securities

table carrying value of investment securities as of december  in thousands securities available for sale us government agencies state and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities other total securities available for sale the investment securities portfolio consists of us government agency securities  municipal securities  and mortgage backed securities which are primarily us government agency sponsored 
a mortgage backed security relies on the underlying pools of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow of principal and interest 
the actual maturities of these securities will differ from the contractual maturities because the loans underlying the security may prepay without prepayment penalties 
decreases in long term interest rates will generally cause an acceleration of prepayment levels 
in a declining interest rate environment  proceeds may not be able to be reinvested in assets that have comparable yields 
at december   united had of its total investment securities portfolio in mortgage backed securities  compared with at december  during  united began purchasing us government agency mortgage backed securities to replace callable us government agency bonds that were expected to be called 
united did not have securities of any issuer in excess of of equity at year end or  excluding us government issues

the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had both fixed and floating interest rates ranging from to 
approximately of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  additional information regarding fhlb advances  including scheduled maturities  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available  at reasonable cost  to meet ongoing operational cash needs 
while the desired level of liquidity will vary depending on a number of factors  it is the primary goal of united to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity in reasonably foreseeable economic environments 
liquidity is defined as the ability of a bank to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining united s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  both depositors and borrowers 
the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of customers and to maintain an optimal balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  so that united can also meet the investment objectives of its shareholders as market interest rates change 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain a position that meets both goals 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities 
mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december   and typically turn over every days as closed loans are sold to investors in the secondary market 
construction and commercial loans that mature in one year or less amounted to billion  or  of the loan portfolio at december  the liability section of the balance sheet provides liquidity through depositors interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are additional sources of liquidity and represent united s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short term liquidity needs

at december   there was million outstanding on those lines  leaving million available 
united had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase fhlb advances by million 
united s internal policy limits brokered deposits to of total non brokered deposits 
at december   united had the capacity to increase brokered deposits by billion and still remain within this limit 
in addition to these wholesale sources  united has the ability to attract retail deposits at any time by competing more aggressively on pricing

uses of cash from operating activities include an increase in deferred income taxes of million and a net decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million consisted primarily an increase in loans of million  the purchase of boli of million  the purchase of premises and equipment of million and the purchase of million of available for sale securities  offset by the maturity of million of available for sale securities and million from the sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities provided the remainder of funding sources for the million of net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of a net increase in short term borrowings of million 
the increases were partially offset by a net decrease in deposits of million 
the purchases of treasury stock of million were partially funded by the million increase in borrowings 
in the opinion of management  united s liquidity position at december  is sufficient to meet its expected cash flow requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as extending loan facilities to customers 
those commitments are primarily issued to local businesses 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit  letters of credit and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
united uses the same credit underwriting procedures for making commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees as for on balance sheet instruments 
united evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis and the amount of the collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held varies  but may include unimproved and improved real estate  certificates of deposit  personal property or other acceptable collateral 
all of these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the total amount of these instruments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements because a significant portion of these instruments expire without being used 
united is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments  or that could significantly affect earnings 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and the unrealized gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  is excluded in the calculation of regulatory capital ratios 
excluding the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income  shareholders equity increased million  or 
the increase includes million of equity issued in connection with the acquisition of gwinnett commercial group  inc dividends of million  or 
per share  were declared on common stock in  an increase of per share from the amount declared in the dividend payout ratios based on basic earnings per share for and were and  respectively 
united has historically retained earnings in order to provide capital for continued growth and expansion 
however  in recognition that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder return  management has targeted a long term payout ratio between and when earnings and capital levels permit 
in  united completed a public offering of its common stock to raise additional capital to support its balanced growth strategy 
through the offering  united issued  shares of its common stock and raised million in capital 
in addition to the common stock offering  united has a number of ongoing sources of equity capital to support its growth needs including a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan that allows existing shareholders to automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends in united s common stock or purchase additional shares directly from united without commissions or fees 
the federal reserve has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and intangible assets goodwill and deposit based intangibles  plus qualifying capital securities 
united s tier i capital totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital such as the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus tier ii capital is referred to as total risk based capital and was million at december  the ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  united has outstanding junior subordinated debentures commonly referred to as trust preferred securities totaling million at december  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital under risk based capital guidelines provided that total trust preferred securities do not exceed certain quantitative limits 
at december   all of united s trust preferred securities qualified as tier i capital 
further information on united s trust preferred securities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  united issued million in subordinated notes due november  proceeds from the issuance were used for general business purposes 
the notes qualify as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
in  united issued million in subordinated step up notes due september  the subordinated notes qualify as tier ii capital under risk based capital guidelines 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of through september   and at a rate of thereafter until maturity or earlier redemption 
the notes are callable at par on september   and september of each year thereafter until maturity 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier i capital divided by quarterly average assets reduced by the amount of goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs  but the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
management believes that united s capital must be well above the minimum capital requirements to maintain its business plan 
united s leverage ratio at december  was 
united monitors these capital ratios to ensure that united and the bank remain within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios of united and united is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a general business corporation in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important effect on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than nominal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
united s management believes the effect of inflation on financial results depends on united s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary effect on performance 
united has an asset liability management program to monitor and manage united s interest rate sensitivity position 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity management the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant effect on united s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changing interest rates  in order to achieve united s overall financial goals 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
united s net interest revenue  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
united manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing united s interest rate sensitivity 
one of the tools management uses to estimate the sensitivity of net interest revenue to changes in interest rates is an interest rate simulation model 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
the simulation model measures the potential change in net interest revenue over a twelve month period under multiple interest rate scenarios 
the base scenario assumes rates remain flat over the next twelve months and is the scenario that all others are compared to in order to measure the change in net interest revenue 
the second scenario is a most likely scenario that projects the most likely change in rates over the next twelve months based on the slope of the yield curve 
united models ramp scenarios that assume gradual increases and decreases of up to basis points each over the next twelve months 
united has a policy for net interest revenue simulation based on rate movements of up basis points ramp over twelve months and down basis points ramp over twelve months from the flat rate scenario 
the policy limits the change in net interest revenue to a increase or decrease in either scenario 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate decrease in net interest revenue 
at december   united s simulation model indicated that a basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate increase in net interest revenue and a basis point decrease in rates over the next twelve months would cause an approximate 
decrease in net interest revenue 
the following table shows interest sensitivity gaps for specified intervals 
table interest rate gap sensitivity as of december  in thousands interest sensitivity periods in months immediate to to to over total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities mortgage loans held for sale loans other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now deposits money market deposits savings deposits time deposits fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements other short term borrowings fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate swaps  net non interest bearing sources of funds interest sensitivity gap cumulative sensitivity gap cumulative gap percent cumulative interest rate sensitivity position as a percent of total interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in united s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate  one to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as demonstrated in the preceding table  of interest bearing liabilities will reprice within twelve months compared with of interest earning assets  however such changes may not be proportionate with changes in market rates within each balance sheet category 
in addition  united may have some discretion in the extent and timing of deposit repricing depending upon the competitive pressures in the markets in which it operates 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly even when the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  due to the two instruments repricing according to different indices 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
these prepayments may have significant effect on the net interest margin 
because of these limitations  an interest sensitivity gap analysis alone generally does not provide an accurate assessment of exposure to changes in interest rates

derivative financial instruments can be a cost effective and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
these contracts consist of interest rate swaps under which united pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate and interest rate floor contracts in which united pays a premium to a counterparty who agrees to pay united the difference between a variable rate and a strike rate if the variable rate falls below the strike rate 
united s derivative financial instruments are classified as either cash flow or fair value hedges 
the changes in fair value of derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income from which amounts are reclassified into interest income over time as the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the effect of change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting effect of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
at december  united had interest rate swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
united had interest rate floor contracts with a total notional amount of million that were also designated as cash flow hedges of prime based loans 
at december   united had receive fixed  pay libor swap contracts with a total notional amount of million that were accounted for as fair value hedges of fixed rate liabilities
