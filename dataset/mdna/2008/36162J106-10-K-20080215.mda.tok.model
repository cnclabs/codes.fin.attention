this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  those described above under item a 
risk factors  and forward looking statements safe harbor below 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we are a leading provider of government outsourced services specializing in the management of correctional  detention and mental health and residential treatment facilities in the united states  australia  
table of contents south africa  the united kingdom and canada 
we operate a broad range of correctional and detention facilities including maximum  medium and minimum security prisons  immigration detention centers  minimum security detention centers and mental health and residential treatment facilities 
our correctional and detention management services involve the provision of security  administrative  rehabilitation  education  health and food services  primarily at adult male correctional and detention facilities 
our mental health and residential treatment services involve the delivery of quality care  innovative programming and active patient treatment  primarily at privatized state mental health 
we also develop new facilities based on contract awards  using our project development expertise and experience to design  construct and finance what we believe are state of the art facilities that maximize security and efficiency 
as of the fiscal year ended december   we managed facilities totaling approximately  beds worldwide and had an additional  beds under development at facilities  including the expansion of five facilities we currently operate and five new facilities under construction 
we also had approximately additional inactive beds available to meet our customers potential future demand for bed space 
for the fiscal year ended december   we had consolidated revenues of billion and we maintained an average companywide facility occupancy rate of 
recent developments acquisition of centracore properties trust on january   we completed the acquisition of cpt pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of september   referred to as the merger agreement  by and among us  geo acquisition ii  inc  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of geo  and cpt 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cpt merged with and into geo acquisition ii  inc  referred to as the merger  with geo acquisition ii  inc  being the surviving corporation of the merger 
as a result of the merger  each share of common stock of cpt was converted into the right to receive in cash  inclusive of a pro rated dividend for all quarters or partial quarters for which cpt s dividend had not yet been paid as of the closing date 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase cpt common stock having an exercise price less than per share was converted into the right to receive the difference between per share and the exercise price per share of the option  multiplied by the total number of shares of cpt common stock subject to the option 
we paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately million for the acquisition of cpt  inclusive of the payment of approximately million in exchange for the common stock and the options  the repayment of approximately million in cpt debt and the payment of approximately million in transaction related fees and expenses 
we financed the acquisition through the use of million in new borrowings under a new term loan b and approximately million in cash on hand 
we deferred debt issuance costs of million related to the new million term loan 
these costs are being amortized over the life of the term loan 
as a result of the acquisition we no longer have ongoing lease expense related to the properties we previously leased from cpt 
however  we have had an increase in depreciation expense reflecting our ownership of the properties and also have higher interest expense as a result of borrowings used to fund the acquisition 
we expect any future adjustments to goodwill as a result of tax elections to be finalized in the first quarter of such changes  if any  may result in additional adjustments to goodwill 
stock split on may   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split of our common stock 
the stock split took effect on june  with respect to stockholders of record on may  following the stock split  our shares outstanding increased from million to million 
all share and per share data included in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
public offering on march   we sold in a follow on public equity offering  shares of our common stock at a price of per share   shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
table of contents reflecting the two for one stock split

the aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering after deducting underwriter s discounts and expenses of million were million 
on march   we utilized million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding debt under the term loan b portion of the senior credit facility 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  which included working capital  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and other assets 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
certain of our contracts have provisions upon which a portion of the revenue is based on our performance of certain targets  as defined in the specific contract 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the amounts are fixed and determinable and the time period over which the conditions have been satisfied has lapsed 
in many instances  we are a party to more than one contract with a single entity 
in these instances  each contract is accounted for separately 
project development and design revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to estimated total cost for each contract 
this method is used because we consider costs incurred to date to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the cost incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
contract costs include all direct material and labor 
table of contents costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance on determining if separate contracts should be evaluated as a single arrangement and if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units  how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
in instances where we provide project development services and subsequent management services  the amount of the consideration from an arrangement is allocated to the delivered element based on the residual method and the elements are recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 
the fair value of the undelivered elements of an arrangement is based on specific objective evidence 
we extend credit to the governmental agencies we contract with and other parties in the normal course of business as a result of billing and receiving payment for services thirty to sixty days in arrears 
further  we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established loss reserves  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses traditionally have been within our expectations 
reserves for insurance losses the nature of our business exposes us to various types of third party legal claims  including  but not limited to  civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and or mistreatment  sexual misconduct claims brought by prisoners or detainees  medical malpractice claims  claims relating to employment matters including  but not limited to  employment discrimination claims  union grievances and wage and hour claims  property loss claims  environmental claims  automobile liability claims  contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or prisoners  including damages arising from a prisoner s escape or from a disturbance or riot at a facility 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain insurance coverage for these general types of claims  except for claims relating to employment matters  for which we carry no insurance 
we currently maintain a general liability policy for all us corrections operations with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
on october   we increased our deductible on this general liability policy from million to million for each claim occurring after october  geo care  inc is separately insured for general and professional liability 
coverage is maintained with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate subject to a million self insured retention 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and casualty risks  workers compensation  medical malpractice  environmental liability and automobile liability 
our australian subsidiary is required to carry tail insurance on a general liability policy providing an extended reporting period through related to a discontinued contract 
we also carry various types of insurance with respect to our operations in south africa  united kingdom and australia 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
in addition  certain of our facilities located in florida and determined by insurers to be in high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited commercial 
table of contents availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in california may prevent us from insuring our facilities to full replacement value 
since our insurance policies generally have high deductible amounts  losses are recorded when reported and a further provision is made to cover losses incurred but not reported 
loss reserves are undiscounted and are computed based on independent actuarial studies 
because we are significantly self insured  the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our claims experience and our ability to control our claims experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
in april  we incurred significant damages at one of our managed only facilities in new castle  indiana 
the total amount of impairments  losses recognized and expenses incurred has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as operating expenses and is offset by million of insurance proceeds we received from our insurance carriers in the first quarter of income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fas no 
fin requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
property and equipment as of december   we had approximately million in long lived property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with fas accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
in july  we terminated our contract with dickens county for the operation of the dickens county correctional center 
as a result  we wrote off our intangible asset related to the facility of million net of accumulated amortization of million 
the impairment 
table of contents charge is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended december  management has reviewed its long lived assets and determined that there are no other events requiring impairment loss recognition for the period ended december  stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the stock based awards  which includes estimates of stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected lives  requires judgment that could materially impact our operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain other recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
contract terminations on april   we announced that the federal bureau of prisons awarded a contract for the management of the  bed taft correctional institution  which we have managed since  to another private operator 
the management contract  which was competitively re bid  was transitioned to the alternative operator effective august  we do not expect the loss of this contract to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  we cancelled the operations and management contract with dickens county for the management of the bed facility located in spur  texas 
the cancellation became effective on december  we have operated the management contract since the acquisition of csc in november we do not expect the termination of this contract to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
on october   we received notice of the termination of our contract with the texas youth commission for the housing of juvenile inmates at the bed coke county juvenile justice center located in bronte  texas 
we are in the preliminary stages of reviewing the termination of this contract

in  our equity affiliate  sacs  recognized a one time tax benefit of million related to a change in south african tax law applicable to companies in a qualified public private partnership ppp with the south african government 
the tax law change has the effect that beginning in government revenues earned under the ppp are exempt from south african taxation 
the one time tax benefit in part related to 
table of contents deferred tax liabilities that were eliminated during as a result of the change in the tax law 
in february  the south african legislature passed legislation that has the effect of removing the exemption from taxation on government revenue 
the law change began to impact the equity in earnings of affiliate beginning in financial condition capital requirements our current cash requirements consist of amounts needed for working capital  debt service  supply purchases  investments in joint ventures  and capital expenditures related to the development of new correctional  detention and or mental health facilities 
in addition  some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility 
generally  these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract 
additional capital needs may also arise in the future with respect to possible acquisitions  other corporate transactions or other corporate purposes 
we are currently developing a number of projects using company financing 
we estimate that these existing capital projects will cost approximately million through the end of  of which million was complete at fiscal year end we estimate our capital requirements for to be approximately million  of which we estimate million of expenditures in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
these capital expenditures are related to the following projects i our renovation and expansion of the bed robert a 
deyton detention facility in clayton county  ga for approximately million  which was completed in the first quarter  ii our funding of the expansion of delaney hall  a facility which we own as a result of the cpt acquisition but do not operate  for approximately million  which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of  iii our construction of the bed rio grande detention center for approximately million which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of  iv our bed expansion of the bed lasalle detention facility for approximately million which is also expected to be complete in the third quarter of  and v our construction of the  bed expansion at the aurora processing center in aurora  colorado for approximately million  which is expected to be complete in capital expenditures related to facility maintenance costs are expected to range between million and million 
in addition to these current estimated capital requirements for and  we are currently in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for  the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
liquidity and capital resources we plan to fund all of our capital needs  including our capital expenditures  from cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility and any other financings which our management and board of directors  in their discretion  may consummate 
our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and borrowings from the million revolver under our third amended and restated credit agreement referred to as our senior credit facility see discussion below 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 
we incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the acquisition cpt in january  csc in november and the share purchase in as of december   we had million of consolidated debt outstanding  excluding million of non recourse debt and capital lease liability balances of million 
as of december   we also had outstanding six letters of guarantee totaling approximately million under separate international credit facilities 
based on our debt covenants and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding  we currently have the ability to borrow an additional 
table of contents approximately million under our senior credit facility 
our significant debt service obligations could have material consequences 
see risk factors risks related to our high level of indebtedness 
our management believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility will be adequate to support our capital requirements for and disclosed above 
however  we are currently in the process of bidding on  or evaluating potential bids for  the design  construction and management of a number of new projects 
in the event that we win bids for these projects and decide to self finance their construction  our capital requirements in and or could materially increase 
in that event  our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings under the senior credit facility may not provide sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs through and and we could be forced to seek additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or refinancing would be available to us on terms equal to or more favorable than our current financing terms  or at all 
in the future  our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital intensive projects will also be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes the notes and in our senior credit facility 
a substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital pursuant to these covenants and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and  as a result  on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have entered into individual executive retirement agreements with our ceo and chairman  president and vice chairman  and chief financial officer 
these agreements provide each executive with a lump sum payment upon retirement 
under the agreements  each executive may retire at any time after reaching the age of each of the executives reached the eligible retirement age of in none of the executives have indicated their intent to retire as of this time 
however  under the retirement agreements  retirement may be taken at any time at the individual executive s discretion 
in the event that all three executives were to retire in the same year  we believe we will have funds available to pay the retirement obligations from various sources  including cash on hand  operating cash flows or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
based on our current capitalization  we do not believe that making these payments in any one period  whether in separate installments or in the aggregate  would materially adversely impact our liquidity 
we are also exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity

inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
please refer to item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k  the forward looking statements safe harbor  as well as the other disclosures contained in this annual report on form k  for further discussion on forward looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward looking statements 
with prison populations growing at to a year  the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing us detention and correctional needs 
the number of state and federal prisoners housed in private facilities increased since mid year with states such as texas  indiana  colorado and florida accounting for more than half of the increase 
at june  approximately of the estimated million state and federal prisoners incarcerated in the united states were held in private facilities  up from in in addition to our strong positions in texas and florida and in the us market in general  we believe we are the only publicly traded us correctional company with international operations 
with the existing operations in south africa and australia and the management of the bed campsfield house immigration removal centre in the united kingdom beginning in the second quarter of  we believe that our international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets 
we intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new customers and contracts  expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities 
we achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal  or rfp 
we primarily rely on the rfp process for organic growth in our us and international corrections operations as well as in our mental health and residential treatment services 
we believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts 
our success in the rfp process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential 
in  we announced new contracts including a contract to reactivate the lasalle detention facility in jena  louisiana 
the new contracts represent  new beds 
this compares to the new projects announced in representing  new beds 
as of december   we have facilities under development or pending commencement of operations which represent approximately  beds 
in addition to pursuing organic growth through the rfp process  we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known customer 
we also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of government outsourced 
table of contents services that we provide 
we will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
revenue domestically  we continue to be encouraged by the number of opportunities that have recently developed in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
the need for additional bed space at the federal  state and local levels has been as strong as it has been at any time during recent years  and we currently expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states  most recently california and arizona and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities primarily resulting from government initiatives to improve immigration security are two of the factors that have contributed to the greater number of opportunities for privatization 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations contract non renewals and contract re bids 
in michigan  the state cancelled our michigan youth correctional facility management contract in based upon the governor s veto of funding for the project 
although we do not expect this termination to represent a trend  any future unexpected terminations of our existing management contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenues 
additionally  several of our management contracts are up for renewal and or re bid in although we have historically had a relative high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our management contracts scheduled to expire in on favorable terms  or at all 
also  while we are pleased with our track record in re bid situations  we cannot assure that we will prevail in any such future situations 
internationally  in the united kingdom  we recently won our first contract since re establishing operations 
we believe that additional opportunities will become available in that market and plan to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
in south africa  we continue to promote government procurements for the private development and operation of one or more correctional facilities in the near future 
we expect to bid on any suitable opportunities 
with respect to our mental health residential treatment services business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  inc  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in addition  we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
we currently have ten projects under various stages of construction with approximately  beds that will become available upon completion 
subject to achieving our occupancy targets these projects are expected to generate approximately million dollars in combined annual operating revenues when opened between the first quarter of and the third quarter of we believe that these projects comprise the largest and most diversified organic growth pipeline in our industry 
in addition  we have approximately additional empty beds available at two of our facilities to meet our customers potential future needs for bed space 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health facilities 
in  operating expenses totaled approximately of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by several factors 
we could experience continued savings under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance program  although the amount of these potential savings cannot be predicted 
these savings  which totaled million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  are now reflected in our current actuarial projections and are a result of improved claims experience and loss development as compared to our results under our prior insurance program 
prior to october   our insurance coverage was provided through an insurance program established by twc  our 
table of contents former parent company 
we experienced significant adverse claims development in general liability and workers compensation in the late s 
beginning in approximately  we made significant operational changes and began to aggressively manage our risk in a proactive manner 
these changes have resulted in improved claims experience and loss development  which we are realizing in our actuarial projections 
as a result of improving loss trends  our independent actuary reduced its expected losses for claims arising since october  we expect future actuarial projections will result in smaller annual adjustments as our improved claims experience represents a more significant component of the historical losses used by our actuary in calculating annual loss projections and related reserve requirements 
in the event our actual claims experience worsens  we could experience increased reserve requirements resulting in additional charges to operating income 
in addition  as a result of our cpt acquisition  we will no longer incur lease expense relating to ten of the facilities purchased in that transaction which we formerly leased from cpt 
during  our operating expenses decreased by the aggregate amount of that lease expense by million 
the savings in facility usage fees was offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the us corrections segment by million 
in the future  these reductions in operating expenses may be offset by increased start up expenses relating to a number of new projects  including our robert a 
deyton detention facility in georgia  montgomery county detention center and rio grande correctional facility projects in texas  graceville correctional facility in florida  northeast new mexico detention facility in new mexico  and maverick county detention center in texas 
overall  excluding start up expenses  we anticipate that operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue will remain relatively flat  consistent with our fiscal year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
we have recently incurred increasing general and administrative costs including increased costs associated with increases in business development costs  professional fees and travel costs  primarily relating to our mental health residential treatment services business 
we expect this trend to continue as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets

payments under the senior credit facility are indexed to a variable interest rate 
based on borrowings outstanding under the term loan b of our senior credit facility of million as of december   immediately following the acquisition of cpt  for every one percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility  our total annual interest expense would increase by million

these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these instruments are subject to interest rate risk  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as of december  and december  the fair value of the swap liability totaled and million and is included in other non current assets or liabilities and as an adjustment to the carrying value of the notes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the south african rand and the british pound currency exchange rates
