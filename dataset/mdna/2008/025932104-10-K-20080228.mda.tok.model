general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of afg s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f overview financial condition afg is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
afg  however  has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
therefore  certain analyses are best done on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis 
in addition  because most of its businesses are financial in nature  afg does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current noncurrent format 
consequently  certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful 
at december   afg parent held approximately million in cash and securities and had borrowed million under its bank line of credit 
aag holding had million borrowed under this line at december  through february   total borrowings under this line increased by million due primarily to the funding of an acquisition 
results of operations through the operations of its subsidiaries  afg is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance  focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses and in the sale of traditional fixed  indexed and variable annuities and a variety of supplemental insurance products 
the property and casualty business is cyclical in nature with periods of high competition resulting in low premium rates  sometimes referred to as a soft market or downcycle followed by periods of reduced competition and higher premium rates  referred to as a hard market or upcycle 
the s were a soft market period  prices started to harden in and accelerated significantly following the terrorist attacks in rate increases for afg s specialty businesses moderated during the latter part of and that trend continued during while afg s workers compensation operations experienced significant rate decreases from through  reflecting the improved claims environment from reform legislation  overall average renewal pricing was flat for and down about in and in afg reported net earnings of million per share diluted in compared to million per share diluted in improved underwriting results in the company s ongoing property and casualty insurance operations and higher investment income were more than offset by lower gains from sales of real estate  realized losses on securities due to impairment writedowns on equity securities and the effect of charges to strengthen reserves for asbestos and other environmental exposures a e within the property and casualty insurance run off operations and a e exposures related to former railroad and manufacturing operations 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
the areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make accounting policies critical are as follows the establishment of insurance reserves  especially asbestos and environmental related reserves  the recoverability of reinsurance  the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs  the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations  and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments 
see liquidity and capital resources uncertainties for a discussion of insurance reserves  recoverables from reinsurers  and contingencies related to american premier s former operations and liquidity and capital resources investments for a discussion of impairments on investments 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac and certain liabilities related to annuities and universal life insurance products are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies 
assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management s estimates of assumed interest rates and investment spreads  surrenders  annuitizations  renewal premiums and mortality 
should actual experience require management to change its assumptions commonly referred to as unlocking  a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust dpac or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have be en if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy 
liquidity and capital resources ratios afg s debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below dollars in millions 
management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings 
december  consolidated debt total capital ratio of debt to total capital including debt secured by real estate excluding debt secured by real estate includes consolidated debt  minority interest and shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains losses related to fixed maturity investments 
afg s ratio of earnings to fixed charges  including annuity benefits as a fixed charge  was for the year ended december  excluding annuity benefits  this ratio was for although the ratio excluding interest on annuities is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under securities and exchange commission rules  it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company 
the naic s model law for risk based capital rbc applies to both life and property and casualty companies 
rbc formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all afg insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
parent and subsidiary liquidity parent holding company liquidity management believes afg has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
if funds generated from operations  including dividends and tax payments from subsidiaries  are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  afg would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings  sales of other assets  or similar transactions 
afg and aag holding can borrow a combined million under their revolving credit facility  which expires in afg and aag holding had a total of million in borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december   bearing interest at a rate of at december  afg believes that this credit agreement provides ample liquidity and can be used to obtain funds for operating subsidiaries or  if necessary  for the parent company 
through february   afg borrowed an additional million under its revolving credit facility primarily to finance an acquisition 
management anticipates that it will call its senior convertible notes for redemption on june   and pay holders who convert cash for the accreted value approximately million and cash or stock for the conversion premium amount to be based on the market price of afg common stock 
during  afg repurchased million shares of its common stock for approximately million  funded the million in costs associated with gafri s purchase of its common stock not previously owned by afg  and redeemed the million of debentures that matured in december through february   afg has repurchased an additional  shares for approximately million 
to better facilitate flows of capital between afg parent company and its annuity and supplemental insurance operations  great american insurance paid a dividend to afg in december in the form of its majority ownership in gafri  giving afg direct ownership of gafri 
during  afg repurchased million of its debentures due for million in cash 
during  afg repurchased million of its debentures due and million of its debentures due for million in cash 
all debentures issued by afg and aag holding are rated investment grade by three nationally recognized rating agencies 
under a currently effective shelf registration statement  afg can offer additional equity or debt securities 
the shelf registration provides afg with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit 
for statutory accounting purposes  equity securities of non affiliates are generally carried at fair value 
at december   afg s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of million 
in addition  great american insurance company owns national interstate corporation natl common stock with a fair value of million and a statutory carrying value of million 
decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group s capital  potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution 
conversely  increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group s dividend paying capability 
under tax allocation agreements with afg  its owned us subsidiaries generally pay taxes to or recover taxes from afg based on each subsidiary s contribution to amounts due under afg s consolidated tax return 
subsidiary liquidity on march   aag holding used funds borrowed under the bank credit line to redeem its million in outstanding subordinated debentures for million in cash 
during  aag holding repurchased million of its senior notes due for million in cash 
in  aag holding repurchased million of its trust preferred securities for million in cash 
the liquidity requirements of afg s insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses  payments of dividends and taxes to afg and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without requiring a sale of investments or contributions from afg 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
in addition  the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments 
the excess cash flow of afg s property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves 
in  natl  a majority owned subsidiary that specializes in property and casualty insurance for the passenger transportation industry  issued  shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
a portion of the million of net proceeds from this offering was used to repay natl s million promissory note to another afg subsidiary 
the remainder was used for other general corporate purposes 
at december   afg owned approximately of natl s common stock 
in the annuity business  where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities  the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities 
with declining rates  afg receives some protection from spread compression due to the ability to lower crediting rates  subject to guaranteed minimums 
in a rising interest rate environment  significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on afg s annuity products 
afg believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
contractual obligations the following table shows an estimate based on historical patterns and expected trends of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities  as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations in millions 
within more than total one year years years years annuity  life  accident and health liabilities a property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses b long term debt  including interest operating leases total c a reserve projections include anticipated cash benefit payments only 
projections do not include any impact for future earnings or additional premiums 
b dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
based on the same assumptions  afg projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling billion as follows within year million  years million  years million  and thereafter million 
actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates 
c afg s million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december   is not included because the period of payment cannot be reliably estimated 
the accreted value of the afg senior convertible notes due in is included in the above table at the first put date 
afg has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at december  off balance sheet arrangements see note n additional information financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to the financial statements 
investments afg attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio  placing emphasis upon total long term performance 
nearly two thirds of afg s consolidated assets are invested in marketable securities 
afg s investment portfolio at december   contained billion in fixed maturities classified as available for sale and million in equity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
the fair value of approximately of afg s fixed maturity and equity security portfolio is based on values provided by pricing services or quotes from brokers 
at december   afg had pretax net unrealized losses of million on fixed maturities and net unrealized gains of million on equity securities 
fixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions 
at december   the average life of afg s fixed maturities was about six years 
approximately of the fixed maturities held by afg at december   were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies 
investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or noninvestment grade 
management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
afg s billion investment in mortgage backed securities mbss represented approximately one third of its available for sale fixed maturities at december  mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
approximately of afg s mortgage backed securities are rated aaa 
at december   afg owned million representing of afg s total fixed maturity portfolio of mortgage backed securities in which the underlying collateral is subprime mortgages 
at that date  the net unrealized loss on these securities was approximately million 
the securities are collateralized by fixed rate mortgages and have an overall average life of approximately years 
at december   afg had no collateralized debt obligations secured by residential mortgages 
at december   afg owned million in securities with credit enhancement provided by bond insurers  including million of insured municipal bonds  million in insured subprime securities included in the million in total subprime exposure discussed above  million in insured corporate bonds and million in insured residential mortgage backed securities 
approximately of the insured municipal bonds carry an explicit underlying rating ie without credit enhancement with an average of a  and of the corporate bonds carry an explicit underlying rating with an average of bbb 
none of the insured subprime securities or the residential mortgage backed securities carry an explicit underlying rating 
management does not believe the risk of loss on the securities without underlying credit ratings is material to afg s financial condition 
the upheaval in the housing and credit markets in the second half of and continuing in has caused many financial institutions to record significant asset writedowns 
this has had an adverse impact on afg s investment portfolio 
summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in afg s balance sheet at december   is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of available for sale fixed maturities and million of equity securities had no unrealized gains or losses at december  securities securities with with unrealized unrealized gains losses available for sale fixed maturities fair value of securities amortized cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss fair value as of amortized cost number of security positions number individually exceeding million gain or loss concentration of gains losses by type or industry exceeding of unrealized mortgage backed securities banks  savings and credit institutions gas and electric services insurance companies state and municipal percentage rated investment grade equity securities fair value of securities cost of securities gross unrealized gain loss fair value as of cost number of security positions number individually exceeding million gain or loss the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of afg s available for sale fixed maturity securities at december   based on their fair values 
asset backed securities and other securities with sinking funds are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities securities with with unrealized unrealized maturity gains losses one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities average life of six years the table below dollars in millions summarizes the unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities by dollar amount 
fair aggregate aggregate value as fair unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities at december  securities with unrealized gains exceeding  issues less than   issues securities with unrealized losses exceeding  issues less than  issues the following table summarizes dollars in millions the unrealized loss for all fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses by issuer quality and length of time those securities have been in an unrealized loss position 
fair aggregate aggregate value as fair unrealized of cost value gain loss basis fixed maturities with unrealized losses at december  investment grade with losses for less than one year issues one year or longer issues non investment grade with losses for less than one year issues one year or longer issues when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a 
whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b 
the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis  c 
historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings and news releases  d

ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
based on its analysis of the factors enumerated above  management believes i afg will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that afg has the ability and intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
although afg has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses  its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry  asset liability management decisions  market movements  changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains 
should afg s ability or intent change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in a future period 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on afg s liquidity 
net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows in millions net realized charges for gains on sales impairment other a total b a adjustments to reflect the impact of realized gains and losses on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and to carry derivatives at fair value 
b includes fourth quarter charge of million to reduce afg s investment in national city corporation to fair value at december  uncertainties as more fully explained in the following paragraphs  management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations 
property and casualty insurance reserves estimating the liability for unpaid losses and lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation 
determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the company including actuarial  underwriting  pricing  claims and operations management 
the estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon a the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written case reserves  b estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  c estimates of claims incurred but not reported or ibnr including possible development on known claims  d estimates based on experience of expense for investigating and adjusting claims  and e the current state of law and coverage litigation 
the process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and lae  adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims 
the ibnr reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves and lae 
management including company actuaries considers items such as the effect of inflation on medical  hospitalization  material  repair and replacement costs  the nature and maturity of lines of insurance  general economic trends and the legal environment in determining the company s best estimate of the ultimate liability 
in addition  historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors are analyzed using actuarial reserve development techniques 
weighing all of the factors  the management team determines a single or point estimate that it records as its best estimate of the liabilities 
ranges of loss reserves are not developed by company actuaries 
this reserve analysis and review is completed each quarter and for every line of business 
each quarterly review includes in depth analysis of over subdivisions of the business  employing multiple actuarial techniques 
for each particular subdivision  actuaries use informed  professional judgment to adjust these techniques as necessary to respond to specific conditions in the data or within the business 
some of the standard actuarial methods employed for the quarterly reserve analysis may include but may not be limited to case incurred development method paid development method projected claim count times projected claim severity bornhuetter ferguson method incremental paid lae to paid loss methods management believes that each method has particular strengths and weaknesses and that no single estimation method is most accurate in all situations 
when applied to a particular group of claims  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method can change over time based on the facts and circumstances 
ultimately  the estimation methods chosen are those which management believes produce the most reliable indication for the particular liabilities under review 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail 
generally  the same actuarial methods are considered for both short tail and long tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both 
the methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims 
for short tail lines  management tends to give more weight to the case incurred and paid development methods  although the various methods tend to produce similar results 
for long tail lines  more judgment is involved  and more weight may be given to the bornhuetter ferguson method and the projected claim count times projected claim severity method 
liability claims for long tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment 
therefore  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more co mplex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
the level of detail in which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
data is generally analyzed by major product or by coverage within product  using countrywide data  however  in some situations  data may be reviewed by state for a few large volume states 
appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business  and other actuarial considerations 
supplementary statistical information is also reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate to use or if adjustments are needed to particular methods 
such information includes open and closed claim counts average case reserves and average incurred on open claims closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages average closed claim severity ultimate claim severity reported loss ratios projected ultimate loss ratios loss payment patterns within each line  results of individual methods are reviewed  supplementary statistical information is analyzed  and all data from underwriting  operating and claim management are considered  in deriving the point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be the result of one test  or a weighted average of several tests  or a judgmental selection as the management team determines is appropriate 
the following table shows in millions the breakdown of afg s property and casualty reserves between case reserves  ibnr reserves and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves 
gross loss reserves at december  total case ibnr lae reserve statutory line of business other liability occurrence workers compensation other liability claims made commercial multiple peril commercial auto truck liability medical special property fire  allied lines  inland marine  earthquake other lines total statutory reserves adjustments for gaap deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance reserves of foreign operations loss reserve discounting reclassify extracontractual reserves total adjustments for gaap total gaap reserves while current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses  there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates 
as shown in footnote a to the reserve development table loss triangle on page  the original estimates of afg s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  over the past years have developed through december   to be deficient for eight years by as much as and redundant for two years by as much as excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos  environmental and other mass tort exposures 
this development illustrates the historical impact caused by variability in factors considered in estimating its insurance reserves 
following is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of the more significant lines of business asbestos  environmental and other mass tort liabilities are separately discussed below 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
however  future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends 
this unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies  or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
it is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables 
however  it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables 
utilizing the effect of a change in overall cos t trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by extrapolation 
each additional change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly about greater than the effect of the previous 
for example  if a change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by million  a change would change net earnings by million 
the estimated cumulative impact that a one percent change in cost trends would have on net earnings is shown below in millions 
effect of change in line of business cost trends other liability occurrence workers compensation other liability claims made commercial auto truck liability medical commercial multi peril the judgments and uncertainties surrounding management s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves have developed 
the following table shows in millions what the impact on afg s net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the december   reserves net of reinsurance developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years

excludes asbestos  environmental and other mass tort liabilities 
the following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses of the more significant lines of business and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period 
other liability occurrence this long tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence  carelessness  or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability occurrence include litigious climate unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues magnitude of jury awards outside counsel costs timing of claims reporting afg recorded favorable development of million in  million in and million in related to its nursing home coverage where both the frequency and severity of claims were lower than previously projected 
in addition  favorable development of million in and million in was recorded in mid continent s general liability business due to claim severity being less than predicted 
afg recorded adverse loss development of million in on prior year umbrella and excess liability business as outside counsel costs exceeded expectations and certain judicial decisions and jury awards were worse than expected 
in addition  million in adverse development was recorded in on a run off book of casualty business due to the frequency and severity of claims being significantly greater than predicted 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
for recent accident years  more weight is given to the bornhuetter ferguson method 
workers compensation this long tail line of business provides coverage to employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations future medical cost inflation timing of claims reporting afg s workers compensation business is written primarily in california 
significant reforms passed by the california state legislature in and in reduced employer premiums and set treatment standards for injured workers 
afg recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in due primarily to the impact of the legislation on medical claim costs being more favorable than previously anticipated 
while the standard actuarial techniques do reflect expected favorable impacts from the reforms  the magnitude of future cost savings depends on the implementation and interpretation of the reforms throughout the workers compensation system over the next several years 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
for recent accident years  more weight is given to the methods based on claim count and severity 
management reviewed the frequency  severity and loss and lae ratios implied by the projections from the standard tests in light of the uncertainties of future cost savings and recent rate actions since the reforms  to determine the appropriate reserve level 
due to the long tail nature of this business  afg has been conservative in reserving for the favorable effects of the reform legislation until a higher percentage of claims have been paid and the ultimate impact of reforms can be estimated with more prec ision 
other liability claims made this long tail line of business consists mostly of directors and officers liability  and professional liability  mostly for lawyers 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability claims made include litigious climate the economy variability of stock prices magnitude of jury awards the general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits that trigger coverage under directors and officers liability policies 
afg recorded adverse prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in on its legal professional liability business as claim severity continued to be higher than previous underlying assumptions 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
the selection of tests and methods vary by subdivision of the data within this line 
some businesses within this line use the paid development method while others use the case incurred development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method 
commercial auto truck liability medical this line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles 
the property damage liability exposure is usually short tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims 
the bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer tailed  although the claim reporting is relatively quick  the final settlement can take longer to achieve 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto truck liability medical are similar to other liability occurrence and include magnitude of jury awards unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues litigious climate and trends change in frequency of severe accidents health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties afg recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in for this line of business as claim severity was significantly lower than in prior assumptions 
commercial multi peril this long tail line of business consists of two or more coverages protecting the insured from various property and liability risk exposures 
the commercial multi peril line of business includes coverage similar to other liability occurrence  so in general  variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial multi peril include those mentioned above for other liability occurrence 
in addition  this line also includes reserves for a run off book of homebuilders business covering contractors liability for construction defects 
variables unique to estimating the liabilities for this coverage include changing legal regulatory interpretations of coverage statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing claims changes in policy forms and endorsements over the years  certain portions of the homebuilders business have experienced adverse interpretations of coverage  coupled with certain statutory changes relating to liability  causing higher than expected emergence of claims from older years 
afg recorded adverse prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in on its run off homebuilders business mostly from exposures in california and nevada 
management believes that changes in policy forms and endorsements implemented in will reduce afg s exposure to such adverse interpretations 
recoverables from reinsurers and availability of reinsurance afg is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers  as reinsurance contracts do not relieve afg of its liability to policyholders 
to mitigate this risk  substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade or better s p ratings or is secured by funds withheld or other collateral 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  which are beyond afg s control and which may affect afg s level of business and profitability 
although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase  management believes that afg will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on afg s results of operations 
afg s gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below 
see item business property and casualty operations reinsurance for more information on afg s reinsurance programs 
for additional information on the effect of reinsurance on afg s historical results of operations see note m insurance reinsurance and the gross loss development table under item business property and casualty operations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the following table illustrates the effect that purchasing reinsurance has had on afg s combined ratio over the last three years 
before reinsurance gross effect of reinsurance actual net of reinsurance asbestos and environmental related a e insurance reserves asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following in millions december  asbestos environmental a e reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable  net of allowance gross a e reserves asbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos 
environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted waste sites 
asbestos claims against manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of their policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure for insurers 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted prod ucts aggregate limits 
afg  along with other insurers  is and will be subject to such non products claims 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether afg and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
therefore  the future impact of such efforts is uncertain 
approximately of afg s net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by afg subsidiaries 
claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non product exposures  and are dominated by small to mid sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants 
the remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods to the asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties 
a majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than  to afg 
asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers  distributors and installers 
pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites 
establishing reserves for a e claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims 
for this group of claims  traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a meaningful range of loss cannot be estimated 
case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified 
in addition to the case reserves established for known claims  management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims 
these additional reserves are management s best estimate based on periodic detailed ground up studies adjusted for payments and identifiable changes  supplemented by management s review of industry information about such claims  with due consideration to individual claim situations 
estimating ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  novel theories of coverage  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase 
emerging trends  such as those named below  could impact afg s reserves and payments there is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved 
these developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state by state solutions 
the manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux 
afg s insureds may make claims alleging significant non products exposures 
while management believes that afg s reserves for a e claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims  actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims  the impact of recent bankruptcy filings  and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage  how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years  and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims 
a variation in loss cost trends  caused by any of the factors previously described  would change net income by approximately million 
from time to time  afg has engaged independent firms to work closely with its claims staff to study the a e reserves of its insurance company subsidiaries 
the most recent study was completed in the second quarter of and resulted in afg recording a pretax charge of million to increase its insurance a e reserves 
a similar study in resulted in a pretax charge of million to strengthen insurance a e reserves 
management expects to conduct an internal comprehensive review of its a e reserves in and an independent study in for a discussion of the and a e reserve strengthening  see management s discussion and analysis results of operations asbestos and environmental reserve charges 
afg tracks its a e claims by policyholder 
the following table shows  by type of claim  the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment 
policyholder counts represent policies written by afg subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance 
number of policyholders with no payments asbestos environmental number of policyholders with payments asbestos environmental total amounts paid net of amounts received from reinsurers for asbestos and environmental claims  including loss adjustment expenses  were as follows in millions asbestos environmental total contingencies related to subsidiaries former operations the a e study discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by american premier s predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by american premier and gafri 
as a result of the study  american premier s and gafri s a e reserves were increased by million and million  respectively  reflecting higher estimates of the cost of mesothelioma claims partially offset by lower claim counts and increased clean up estimates at certain former rail and manufacturing sites 
at december   american premier and gafri had liabilities aggregating million and million  respectively  for claims and contingencies arising from these former operations 
management expects to conduct a comprehensive review of these liabilities in conjunction with the property and casualty group s a e studies every two years 
for a discussion of the uncertainties in determining american premier s and gafri s ultimate liability  see note k commitments and contingencies to the financial statements

per share in excluding the effects of items shown in the table above  net earnings increased in and due primarily to improved property and casualty underwriting results and increased investment income 
property and casualty insurance underwriting afg reports its specialty insurance business in the following sub segments i property and transportation  ii specialty casualty  iii specialty financial  and iv california workers compensation 
to understand the overall profitability of particular lines  the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered 
certain short tail lines of business primarily property coverages generally have quick loss payouts  which reduce the time funds are held  thereby limiting investment income earned thereon 
on the other hand  long tail lines of business primarily liability coverages and workers compensation generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle  thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received 
underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio  which is a sum of the ratios of losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 
while afg desires and seeks to earn an underwriting profit on all of its business  it is not always possible to do so 
as a result  afg attempts to expand in the most profitable areas and control growth or even reduce its involvement in the least profitable ones 
over the last several years  afg has been realigning its property and casualty business mix and focusing on rate adequacy in order to improve its operating profitability 
management has continued to direct capital in order to take advantage of certain specialty market opportunities 
management believes these actions have been successful and that the current mix of specialty businesses positions the company for solid growth and continued profitability 
afg s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for twenty one of the last twenty two years and excluding afg s special a e charges  for all twenty two years 
management believes that afg s insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of product line diversification  stringent underwriting discipline  alignment of incentives  and  more recently  a specialty niche focus 
premiums and combined ratios for afg s property and casualty insurance operations were as follows dollars in millions gross written premiums gaap property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation other net written premiums gaap property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation other combined ratios gaap property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial a california workers compensation total specialty aggregate including discontinued lines b a includes points in  points in and points i n for the effect of losses related to the residual value business in run off

gross and net written premiums for the specialty insurance operations increased in compared to premium growth within the property and transportation and specialty financial groups was offset by significant rate declines in the california workers compensation business  softening market conditions within certain of the specialty casualty group operations and the impact of the automobile residual value insurance rvi business and earthquake exposed excess property operations previously placed in run off 
the specialty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of million in  million higher than in the combined ratio improved points compared to these improvements were largely driven by a higher amount of favorable reserve development  primarily within the specialty casualty group  higher earnings in the crop insurance business and lower losses from the rvi business in run off 
specialty insurance results for include million points of favorable reserve development compared to million points in gross written premiums for the specialty insurance operations increased and net written premiums increased in compared to significant premium growth from the property and transportation and specialty financial groups was partially offset by a decline in california workers compensation premiums 
the specialty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of million in  million higher than in  reflecting premium growth  rate adequacy in most of the businesses  lower catastrophe losses  and the impact of favorable reserve development within the specialty casualty  property and transportation and california workers compensation groups 
the results include million points of catastrophe losses 
property and transportation gross and net written premiums increased in compared to primarily as a result of growth in the crop and transportation operations 
the underwriting profit of million was higher than in these results were primarily due to significantly higher crop insurance earnings and minimal catastrophe losses in compared to million points in net written premiums for increased over due primarily to growth in the property and inland marine and transportation operations and new premium volume from the acquisition of farmers crop insurance alliance 
the growth in net written premiums was less than the gross written premium growth due to the effect of crop reinsurance programs 
the underwriting results benefited from strong underwriting profits in the crop insurance division resulting from higher favorable reserve development and additional profits from the farmers acquisition 
this group s combined ratio was  slightly better than its results  reflecting excellent profitability and continuing favorable reserve development in nearly all of the business lines and lower catastrophe losses 
the underwriting results include points of favorable reserve development and points of catastrophe losses compared to points of favorable development and points of catastrophe losses in specialty casualty gross and net written premiums decreased in compared to primarily due to stronger competition in the excess and surplus lines and softening in the homebuilders market  which affected afg s general liability coverages 
the specialty casualty group s underwriting profit of million was higher than in these results include million points of favorable reserve development  coming largely from the general liability and excess and surplus operations  compared to million points in net written premiums for were higher than in due primarily to volume growth and higher premium retention within several of the group s businesses as well as third quarter changes to reinsurance agreements within the specialized program business line  which resulted in the recapture of million in premiums previously ceded to reinsurers 
this group s combined ratio improved points for compared to results for included points of unfavorable reserve development 
specialty financial gross and net written premiums increased in primarily due to growth in the financial institutions  lease and loan  and fidelity and surety operations  which was partly offset by lower premiums resulting from the run off of the rvi business 
the higher net written premium growth rate reflects a decrease in premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements within the lease and loan businesses 
this group s combined ratio of improved points compared with this improvement is due primarily to lower losses in the run off rvi business 
each of the business units within this group produced solid underwriting profits for the year 
excluding the effect of rvi  the group s combined ratio would have been for  about the same as in net written premiums for increased above the period reflecting premium growth principally in the financial institutions  lease and loan and surety and fidelity businesses 
the group experienced disappointing results in resulting from losses within the run off rvi business 
these losses were primarily attributable to lower than expected proceeds from the sale at auction of certain luxury cars and sport utility vehicles 
excluding the effect of the rvi business  this group s combined ratio was  as the group s other operations are generating solid underwriting profits 
california workers compensation gross and net written premiums decreased in due to renewal rate reductions averaging about for the year 
this business produced excellent profitability throughout  reflecting the ongoing positive effects of the california workers compensation reforms that have resulted in an improving claims environment while also providing reduced workers compensation costs for employers through lower premium levels 
the combined ratio was points higher than the same period a year earlier  reflecting the results of rate reductions  which have been responsive to the improved claims environment 
this business continued to benefit from favorable prior year reserve development 
the results include million points of favorable development compared to million points in due to the long tail nature of this business  afg has been conservative in reserving for the favorable effects of the reform legislation until a higher percentage of claims are paid and the ultimate impact of reforms can be estimated with more precision 
the decrease in net written premiums and point increase in the combined ratio for compared to reflect the effects of the california workers compensation reforms discussed above 
renewal rate decreases averaged about in and in underwriting results include favorable prior year loss development of million in and million in asbestos and environmental reserve charges afg has undertaken periodic reviews of its asbestos and environmental reserves with the aid of independent actuarial and engineering firms and specialty outside counsel 
in july  afg completed its most recent comprehensive study of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run off operations of its property and casualty group and its exposures related to former railroad and manufacturing operations and sites 
as a result of the study  afg recorded a million charge net of reinsurance in the second quarter of to increase the property and casualty group s asbestos reserves by million and its environmental reserves by million 
the primary causes of the increase in asbestos reserves were an increase in settlement amounts attributable to mesothelioma claims  the impact of a large case settlement with an installer of material containing asbestos  and continuing uncertainties related to non product liability exposures 
these trends were partially offset by lower than anticipated notices of new accounts and favorable development in the assumed reinsurance run off operations 
the primary reason for the increase in environmental reserves was a reassessment of the potential amount of loss related to certain environmental sites owned by a single insured 
at december   the property and casualty group s a e reserves were million  net of reinsurance recoverables 
the survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare a e reserves strength among companies 
this ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for a e exposures by the three year average of paid losses  and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments 
because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability  caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio 
at december   afg s three year survival ratios were times paid losses for the asbestos reserves and times paid losses for the total a e reserves 
these ratios compare favorably with am best s most re cent report on a e survival ratios november which were for asbestos and for total industry a e reserves 
excluding amounts associated with the settlements of asbestos related coverage litigation for ap green industries see legal proceedings and another large claim  afg s three year survival ratios were and times paid losses for the asbestos reserves and total a e reserves  respectively 
in addition to the property and casualty group  the study encompassed reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures of the former railroad and manufacturing operations 
as a result of the study  afg recorded a second quarter charge of million included in other expenses to increase the a e reserves related to these former operations 
the million increase in asbestos reserves was the result of increasing estimates of the cost of mesothelioma claims partially offset by lower estimated overall claim counts 
the million increase in environmental reserves was due primarily to increased clean up estimates at certain former railroad and manufacturing sites 
the study relied on a ground up exposure analysis 
with respect to asbestos  it considered products and non products exposures  paid claims history  the pattern of new claims  settlements and projected development 
the asbestos legal climate remains very difficult to predict 
while some progress has been made in state asbestos tort reform and judicial rulings  that progress has been somewhat offset by increased claims costs  increased defense costs  the assertion of non products theories and an expanding pool of plaintiffs and defendants 
in  afg completed a similar comprehensive study of its a e exposures relating primarily to the run off operations of its property and casualty group 
as a result of this study  afg recorded a third quarter pretax charge of million  net of million in reinsurance recoverables 
this charge resulted in an increase in asbestos reserves of million and environmental reserves of million 
a primary driver of the increase in afg s asbestos reserves in was the use by independent actuaries of evolving methodologies  including developing parameters for estimating loss adjustment expenses and reducing reliance on extrapolation techniques 
in addition  the independent actuaries indicated that their views evolved regarding estimation of the potential exposure for both products and non products claims 
in the actuaries views  this refined approach increased estimates of the company s indicated ultimate losses 
the estimates of industry ultimate losses and afg s historic premium market share had not changed since a study 
in addition  there had been no significant change in afg s payment patterns 
in the study  the actuaries also gave additional weight to claims associated with peripheral defendants bringing direct insurance claims 
the increase in the number of direct insurance claims from peripheral defendants increased the projections of future defense cost and loss exposure 
with respect to the environmental claims  the study considered both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance  projected exposure at both national priorities list npl sites and non npl sites  historic payment patterns  patterns of new claims  settlements and projected development 
the increase in environmental reserves in was primarily due to an increase in clean up costs at certain sites above prior expectations and an unexpected increase in the number of new claims reported to the company 
in addition  projected development on a few claims exceeded estimates in the previous study 
other mass tort charge in connection with the review of a e reserves in  afg reviewed its other mass tort exposures and recorded a million pretax charge 
afg s other mass tort reserves were million and million net of reinsurance recoverables at december  and  respectively 
loss development as shown in note m insurance insurance reserves  afg s property and casualty operations recorded favorable loss development of million in compared to million in and unfavorable development of million in related to prior accident years 
major areas of favorable adverse development were as follows in millions property and transportation specialty casualty specialty financial california workers compensation other specialty special asbestos  environmental and other mass tort charges other the favorable development in property and transportation related primarily to lower than expected claim frequency and severity in specialty commercial automobile  ocean marine and inland marine products 
also contributing to the favorable development in and was lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the crop business 
the favorable development in specialty casualty during was the result of lower than expected frequency and severity in the nursing home liability product and general liability business 
the nursing home liability product also contributed to the favorable development in  along with insurance products for not for profit organizations  partially offset by adverse development in professional liability and certain run off businesses 
the adverse development in was mainly in the professional liability and runoff casualty businesses partially offset by favorable development in the excess and surplus and not for profit businesses 
adverse development in excess casualty runoff impacted  reflecting higher frequency and severity of claims related to the through accident years 
the favorable development in specialty financial in was in the fidelity and crime products where the severity of loss was less than expected 
the adverse development in related to higher than expected severity on claims from accident years to the favorable development in california workers compensation reflects the impact of the workers compensation reform legislation passed in and the unfavorable development in other specialty reflects adjustments to the deferred gain on the retroactive insurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of a business in  net of related amortization

other income the million decrease in other income in compared to reflects the gains on sale of real estate assets discussed above  partially offset by fee income generated from the reinsurance agreements entered into in connection with the ceres acquisition in august  higher policy charges related to growth in the annuity business and higher fee income in the property and casualty dealer services business 
annuity benefits annuity benefits reflect amounts accrued on annuity policyholders funds accumulated 
on deferred annuities annuities in the accumulation phase  interest is generally credited to policyholders accounts at their current stated interest rates 
furthermore  for two tier deferred annuities annuities under which a higher interest amount can be earned if a policy is annuitized rather than surrendered  additional reserves are accrued for i persistency and premium bonuses and ii excess benefits expected to be paid for future deaths and annuitizations 
changes in crediting rates  actual surrender  death and annuitization experience or modifications in actuarial assumptions can affect these additional reserves 
significant changes in projected investment yields could result in charges or credits to earnings in the period the projections are modified 
annuity benefits increased million in compared to  reflecting higher sales of fixed indexed annuities 
annuity benefits for increased slightly compared to as the effect of internal growth and the acquisition of old standard life fixed annuity business were offset by the effect of the fourth quarter unlocking charge discussed below  lower average effective crediting rates and the sale of gapr 
in the fourth quarter of  afg conducted its annual review of the actual results and future assumptions underlying its annuity operations  including assumptions related to future interest rates and persistency 
similar to the review  there were no significant adjustments or unlockings recorded in annuity benefits 
in  primarily as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment  afg unlocked the actuarial assumptions related to its annuity business in force and recorded a pretax charge of approximately million to insurance liabilities related to that business 
annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses include amortization of annuity  supplemental insurance and life business deferred policy acquisition costs dpac as well as a portion of commissions on sales of insurance products 
annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses also include amortization of the present value of future profits of businesses acquired pvfp 
the million increase in annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses in compared to reflects the growth in the annuity and supplemental insurance business  the acquisition of ceres in august and the fourth quarter dpac write off discussed below 
the million decrease in annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses for compared to reflects the effect of the fourth quarter dpac write offs discussed below and the january sale of gapr  partially offset by the ceres and old standard life acquisitions and other growth in the annuity and supplemental insurance businesses 
as a result of the annual review of actual results and future assumptions discussed above under annuity benefits  afg recorded a million write off of dpac due to increased mortality in the run off life operations 
in  no significant unlockings were deemed necessary 
in  afg recorded net charges of million to annuity and supplemental insurance acquisition expenses primarily related to spread narrowing partially offset by the expected improved future persistency related to afg s annuities  due to the impact of the current interest rate environment 
also in  afg recorded a million write off of dpac due to an unexpected increase in mortality in the run off life operations 
the vast majority of the annuity and supplemental insurance group s dpac asset relates to its fixed annuity  variable annuity and life insurance lines of business 
unanticipated spread compression  decreases in the stock market  adverse mortality experience  and higher than expected lapse rates could lead to further write offs of dpac or pvfp in the future 
interest on borrowed money changes in interest expense result from fluctuations in market rates as well as changes in borrowings

proposed accounting standards convertible notes in august  the fasb issued a proposed fasb staff position fsp a addressing convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the proposed fsp would require the proceeds from the issuance of such debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized as additional interest expense over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding 
the proposed change in accounting  originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and applied retroactively  has been delayed one year 
afg is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this proposal 
the fasb has proposed an amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share 
currently  sfas no 
allows companies issuing securities that can be settled in cash or stock such as afg s senior convertible notes to exclude the issuable shares from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when there is a stated intent and ability to deliver cash in lieu of stock upon settlement or conversion 
the proposed statement would require companies to assume settlement in stock despite the ability and intent to settle in cash and include those shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
the proposed amendment would reduce diluted earnings per share by

afg s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its investment portfolio and annuity contracts  which are exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
to a much lesser extent  afg s long term debt is also exposed to interest rate risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of afg s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
afg s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
this practice is designed to allow flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of afg s insurance operations are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
afg s annuity and run off life operations attempt to align the duration of their invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
the following table provides information about afg s available for sale fixed maturity investments at december  and  that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows principal cash flows in millions and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mortgage backed securities mbs and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected 
december  december  principal principal cash flows rate cash flows rate thereafter thereafter total total fair value fair value annuity contracts substantially all of afg s fixed rate annuity contracts permit afg to change crediting rates subject to minimum interest rate guarantees as determined by applicable law enabling management to react to changes in market interest rates 
in late  afg began issuing products with guaranteed minimum crediting rates of less than in states where required approvals have been received 
actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and certain annuity liabilities  as well as afg s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if a low interest rate environment continues for an extended period  or if increases in interest rates cause policyholder behavior to differ significantly from current expectations 
projected payments in millions in each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter on afg s fixed annuity liabilities at december were as follows 
fair first second third fourth fifth thereafter total value at december   the average stated crediting rate on the in force block of afg s principal fixed annuity products was approximately 
the current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on new sales of afg s fixed annuity products generally range from to 
afg estimates that its effective weighted average crediting rate on its in force business over the next five years will approximate 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spreads  ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
afg s indexed annuities represented approximately of annuity benefits accumulated at december  these annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
afg attempts to mitigate the risk in the index based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
afg s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities  due to an increase in the market index  will be generally offset by unrealized and realized gains on the call options purchased by afg 
under sfas no 
 both the index based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and adjusted to fair value through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to fair value had a net effect of less than of annuity benefits in and long term debt the following table shows scheduled principal payments in millions on fixed rate long term debt of afg and its subsidiaries and related weighted average interest rates for each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter
