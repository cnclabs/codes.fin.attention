goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment rather than amortizing them 
our goodwill is related to our contract flying segment 
we evaluate the carrying value of this asset each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
we perform an impairment review on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
our review includes the acquisition  market multiple and income approaches to valuation 
if this review indicates that our reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to the fair value 
we performed this review during  and and determined that we did not have any impairment of our reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
our annual impairment test is performed as of june of each year 
airport operating rights  the rights to use certain take off and landing slots and gates  are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the related airport facility lease  which approximates years  with no residual value

i deferred credits our spare part and flight training credits are primarily derived from our purchase agreement with embraer 
all spare part credits are used to offset the purchase price of initial spare parts provisioning for our newly delivered aircraft 
similarly  the flight training credits are used to pay for the initial simulator rent costs for our pilots 
these credits are recorded in long term liabilities  with an offsetting entry to prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities if we used more credits than the amount we are entitled to at year end 
the deferred credits are amortized as a reduction to our aircraft rent expense over the life of the associated aircraft lease 
amortization totaled million for each and the prepayments and other current assets or current accrued liabilities are reduced as the credits are used or as the remaining firm order aircraft are delivered 
j operating revenue passenger revenue 
we recognized our passenger revenue under the continental cpa based on negotiated rates for each scheduled block hour airlines flies for continental 
the rates were designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in some costs and expenses that are generally controllable by airlines 
we also record other passenger revenues earned under the continental cpa  such as percentage of completed flights  certain on time departures and baggage handling 
see note for details of the block hour rates and the performance incentive payments 
our passenger revenue is reconciled and settled with continental on a monthly basis  except for the quarterly reconciliation of airlines costs within the margin band as defined in the continental cpa 
the rates we use to calculate our passenger revenue are based on our interpretation of the agreement 
all fully reconciled costs incurred in connection with the continental cpa are recorded as expense and revenue on a gross basis except for certain costs such as fuel costs above our fuel and related tax cap and facility rent at continental s hubs 
these costs are absorbed by continental under the terms of the continental cpa 
consequently  we are not the primary obligor for these costs and accordingly  these costs are not recorded as either revenue or expense by us 

table of contents for the delta cpa  we receive a base rate for each completed block hour and departure and are reimbursed for certain pass through costs 
we record the base rate and the reimbursements for pass through costs as passenger revenue 
for branded flying  tickets are sold and processed internally  with amounts due settled either by cash payments up front or pursuant to the terms of our agreements with various credit card service vendors 
additionally  we accept flight coupons to carry passengers on our aircraft from other air carriers  which are then processed internally and settled on a monthly basis through an airline clearing house  as appropriate  or pursuant to the terms of various industry or codeshare agreements  such as the delta prorate 
we recognize passenger revenue when transportation is provided or when an unused ticket expires 
nonrefundable tickets expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance of the intended flight 
the amount of passenger ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is included in our consolidated balance sheets as air traffic liability 
we are also required to collect certain taxes and fees from the passengers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable agency on a periodic basis 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  and airport passenger facility charges 
these items are collected from our customers at the time they purchase their tickets  but are not included in passenger revenue 
we record a liability upon collection from the customer and release the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency 
ground handling and other 
we recognize our non passenger revenue  ground handling and other revenues as services are provided 
k frequent flyer awards we launched our frequent flyer program  jetset  during to encourage repeat travel over our system 
our frequent flyer program is based on trips flown rather than on mileage and jetset customers earn a minimum of one credit for each one way trip flown or two credits for each roundtrip flown 
the jetset award ticket award ticket offers one free roundtrip award valid to any destination available on expressjet brand flying after the accumulation of credits 
award tickets are automatically generated when earned by the customer rather than allowing the customer to bank credits indefinitely 
award tickets must be used to purchase a ticket within months after their issuance 
award tickets are capacity controlled and may not be available on peak travel dates 
at december   the number of award tickets fully earned since april was approximately  of which over had been flown 
the liability at year end associated with the outstanding travel awards that are expected to be redeemed for free travel on expressjet as well as the expense associated with the awards claimed during was immaterial to our results of operations 
at this time  we recognize the liability as a component of other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet

in addition  as our collective bargaining agreements become amendable  we accrue for anticipated retroactive pay that we estimate will be due under the new contract 
however  actual costs may differ materially from our estimates 
n aircraft facilities leases all of our aircraft are either leased or sub leased from continental 
we also have airport and maintenance facility leases that are leased from airport authorities or other municipal authorities 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset  as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
the assumptions used in our lease classification analyses are based on our interpretation of available market data and specific contract terms 
o maintenance and repair costs maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment  including the overhaul of aircraft components  are charged to operating expense as incurred  except for those maintenance costs covered by power by the hour agreements  which are expensed based on contractual terms 
in and  power by the hour arrangements represented approximately and  respectively  of our maintenance  materials and repairs costs 
p income taxes deferred income taxes  which are provided under the liability method  are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws 
operating losses for recorded as a receivable represent the amount which can be carried back and applied against previous years income 
the remaining operating losses which cannot be carried back and are dependent on the generation of future taxable income are recorded as a deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized

basic earnings per common share basic eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the company

s recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements statement  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
the new standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
the standard also establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
on february   fasb decided to issue fasb staff position fas b which allows partial deferral of the effective date of statement for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those that are recognized or disclosed in the financials at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of statement for all financial assets and liabilities excluding those included in the deferral listed above including confirming that our valuation policies are consistent with exit price as prescribed by statement  however  we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we currently expect the adoption of statement to have an impact on the valuation and disclosure of our investment in ars that were entered into subsequent to december  
table of contents t reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made in prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation  including million of operating revenue as of december  which was reclassed to other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and a million increase in restricted cash from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended december  note capacity purchase agreement with continental general 
we currently derive the majority of our revenue from the continental cpa 
under this agreement  airlines operates flights on behalf of continental as continental express 
continental controls and is responsible for scheduling  pricing and managing seat inventories and is entitled to all revenue associated with the operation of the aircraft 
we also have various other agreements with continental that govern our relationship 
under the continental cpa  some marketing related costs normally associated with operating an airline are borne by continental 
these costs include reservations and sales  commissions  advertising  revenue accounting  fare and tariff filings  and food and beverage service 
on december   continental gave us notice of its intention to withdraw aircraft from the agreement beginning in december and ending in june we subsequently decided to retain all aircraft 
as of december   we had transitioned aircraft from continental 
compensation and operational responsibilities 
under the agreement  airlines is entitled to payment for each block hour that continental schedules it to fly 
payment is based on a formula designed to provide airlines with a target operating margin of before taking into account variations in certain costs and expenses that are generally within our control 
in accordance with the agreement  the original cost components used in this formula remained in place until december   after which new rates were to be established annually with the same methodology 
we have exposure for most labor costs and some maintenance and general administrative expenses  if the actual costs are higher than those reflected in our block hour rates 
beginning in the fall of  we began annual negotiations with continental to adjust the scheduled block hour rates as required under the continental cpa 
the agreement calls for rates to be set by november of each year 
see the detailed discussion of the rate setting process below 
capacity and fleet matters 
except for the withdrawal of two aircraft in late december  the continental cpa covered all of airlines aircraft during as of december   aircraft remain covered under our agreement with continental 
the continental cpa also allowed us to be continental s exclusive regional jet service provider at newark s liberty international  houston s bush intercontinental and cleveland s hopkins international airports through december  the continental cpa also provides that continental has the right to withdraw a limited number of our regional jets covered by the agreement under certain circumstances upon months notice 
on december   continental gave us a withdrawal notice with respect to aircraft  the maximum number that it could withdraw at that time 
under the terms of the agreement  continental cannot withdraw additional aircraft until december  unless the agreement is terminated early  which continental can do at any time upon months notice 

table of contents the continental cpa has a provision for the interest rate implicit in calculating the scheduled lease payments we make to continental to increase by basis points if we retain aircraft released from the agreement 
see item business capacity purchase and other agreements with continental airlines aircraft financing 
we have options for erj xr aircraft that may be exercised for other types of aircraft within the erj family 
our next option exercise date is august  if we do not exercise or extend our option as of this date  options will expire 
during  continental declined the right to include any of these option aircraft under the continental cpa 
we retain the right to exercise them and fly these aircraft for other airlines or under our own code  subject to some restrictions  however  we will have to finance our acquisition of these aircraft independently 
so long as scheduled flights under the continental cpa represent either at least of all our scheduled flights or at least of our aircraft are covered by the continental cpa  we are required to allocate our crews  maintenance personnel  facilities and other resources on a priority basis to scheduled flights under the continental cpa above all of our other flights and aircraft 
term and termination of agreement and remedies for breach 
the continental cpa is scheduled to expire on december  at its sole election  continental can extend the term of the agreement for up to four additional five year terms through december  upon written notice delivered at least months prior to the expiration of the initial term 
continental s first option to extend must be delivered to us by december  continental may terminate the agreement at any time with months notice  or for cause without notice 
cause is defined as our bankruptcy  suspension or revocation of our authority to operate as a scheduled airline  cessation of our operations as a scheduled airline  other than as a result of a union authorized labor strike or any temporary cessation not to exceed days  a union authorized labor strike that continues for days  or our intentional or willful material breach that substantially deprives continental of the benefits of the agreement and is not cured within days of notice of the breach 
continental may also terminate the agreement at any time upon our material breach that does not constitute cause and continues for days after we receive notice of the breach 
if we materially breach the agreement including for cause and  for breaches other than cause  fail to cure the breach within days after we receive notice of the breach  we will have to pay continental an amount equal to the expected margin contained in the block hour rates for scheduled flights from the th day or immediately  without receipt of any notice  if the breach is for cause until the breach is cured 
in addition  continental may terminate the agreement immediately without notice or giving us an opportunity to cure if it makes a reasonable and good faith determination  using recognized standards of safety  that there is a material safety concern with our operation of any flight under the continental cpa 
if continental materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within days after we notify it of the breach  we will be entitled to obtain our payments directly from an airline clearing house from the th day until the duration of the default 
in addition  continental and we are each entitled to seek damages and equitable remedies in arbitration 

table of contents as discussed above  continental has reduced the level of its commitment for our aircraft under the continental cpa  which has reduced our revenue and earnings 
furthermore  continental leases from third parties a substantial portion of the aircraft and airport facilities that it subleases to us 
if continental declared bankruptcy or otherwise defaulted under these leases  we would have no rights to these aircraft or facilities 
our access to our aircraft and airport facilities would depend on negotiations between the lessors and us 
most favored nations 
so long as continental is our largest customer  if we enter into a capacity purchase or economically similar agreement with another major airline defined as any airline with annual revenues greater than million  prior to adjustment for inflation since to provide regional airline service for more than aircraft on terms and conditions that are  in the aggregate  less favorable to us than those in the continental cpa  the agreement has a provision that may allow continental to amend its agreement with us to conform to the terms and conditions of our new agreement 
rate negotiation and amendment 
as part of the rate negotiation  we agreed to cap airlines prevailing margin at to ensure the long term stability of the continental cpa 
airlines also began including previously unreconciled costs  as discussed above  within the margin band  although it is not reimbursed if these costs are higher and cause its prevailing margin to fall below the margin floor 
airlines remained entitled to receive incentive payments from continental if its rate of controllable cancellations was lower than its historical benchmark  but was no longer required to pay continental a penalty for controllable cancellations unless the rate rises above 
airlines continued to receive a small per passenger fee and incentive payments for certain on time departure and baggage handling performance 
during  airlines quarterly reconciliation payments to continental totaled million  based on the terms of this agreement

if the prevailing margin were less than due to the impact of certain costs  as described below  or if the prevailing margin were above due to other items  no reconciliation payments would be made from either continental or airlines 
maintenance  materials and repairs not included above passenger services other rental expenses other operating expenses 
table of contents under our fuel purchase agreement with continental  fuel and fuel tax expense are reconciled to the lower of the actual costs or the agreed upon caps of cents per gallon and cents per gallon  respectively 
if the fuel purchase agreement with continental were not in place  the fuel cost  including related taxes  would have been  and per gallon for the years ended december   and respectively 
depreciation is reconciled for assets and capital projects accounted for in the continental cpa or those approved by continental outside of the continental cpa 
the prevailing margin used to calculate the reconciliation payment does not take into account performance incentive payments  including payments from controllable cancellation performance  litigation costs above a historical benchmark and other costs that are not included in the block hour rates or covered by adjustments to them or are not reasonable and customary in the industry 
in  the fully reconciled costs and costs within the margin band under the continental cpa represented approximately and of total operating costs  respectively 
certain costs that were unreconciled under the continental cpa prior to now require airlines to make a reconciliation payment to continental if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be greater than 
however  if the differences cause the prevailing margin to be less than  they remain unreconciled 
these costs are wages and salaries  and benefits not included in the table above 
rate setting 
since  continental has proposed a number of amendments to the continental cpa  which would have  among other things  significantly reduced the amount continental pays us for the regional airline service we provide and would have dramatically reduced our rights to the aircraft 
we negotiated with continental to try to reach an agreeable compromise 
our board of directors  which typically meets five times a year  held meetings in  six of which were special meetings to consider continental s proposals and to formulate counterproposals 
based on their evaluations  including the analysis of independent financial advisers  the board determined that the rates proposed by continental would not be in the best interest of our stockholders and declined continental s proposal 
we made counterproposals that we believed addressed continental s concerns  but were fair to our stockholders as well 
however  to date  we have not been able to reach a long term agreement 
in december  continental announced that it believed the rates under the continental cpa had become too expensive and that it would terminate of our flying under that agreement 
although the continental cpa contemplates a november deadline for setting the following year s rates  the scheduled block hour rates were finalized in april consistent with the methodology set forth in the agreements 
rate setting 
in  continental challenged our interpretation of the continental cpa and sought to impose rates for that we believed were inconsistent with the methodology established in the agreement 
we were unable to agree on the rates and  in accordance with the terms of the continental cpa  we submitted our dispute to binding arbitration 
the arbitration panel determined that the annual budgeted rates originally presented by airlines should be reduced in the aggregate by million or less than of our total continental cpa operating revenue  which included the target operating margin 
although we believe our original rates were appropriate  we were pleased with the panel s decision 
the scheduled block hour rates were finalized in october  and we recorded our passenger revenue under the continental cpa using the block hour rates determined by the panel for all of 
table of contents rate setting 
we began rate discussions with continental last september 
the continental cpa contemplates a november deadline for setting the rates  however  the parties agreed to extend the deadline 
although we believed that we were nearing completion of the rate setting process  continental advised us on february  that if we were unable to reach agreement by march  they might initiate arbitration proceedings again in accordance with the provisions of the continental cpa 
we can also initiate arbitration if we think it necessary 
as of the date of this filing neither party has triggered arbitration and we remain hopeful that it will not be necessary 
continental also advised us that it believes that it overpaid airlines by million in and million in we believe that if we were required to arbitrate these matters we would prevail 
however  we may not be successful in resolving these disputes without reducing our income 
we cannot currently predict the timing or the resolution of these matters 
although we are hopeful that we can agree on rates and resolve continental s other claims without arbitration  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
if we are required to arbitrate  each party will select one arbitrator  and those two arbitrators will select the third arbitrator to complete the panel 
the continental cpa sets forth procedures and a schedule that will likely result in a hearing and the issuance of a final decision by late in the second or early in the third quarter of expressjet will continue to be paid under the block hour rates during the arbitration process and expects the decision setting the revised rates to be retroactive to january  note segment reporting statement of financial accounting standard no

expressjet has three major reportable segments contract flying  branded flying and aviation services 
contract flying includes our corporate aviation charter division and our capacity purchase agreements with continental and delta 
under contract flying  revenues are contractually determined with continental  delta and other parties  which helps insulate some of the underlying operating expenses  such as fuel 
additionally  under these arrangements  we do not have the obligation to market  distribute or sell seats directly to passengers on our aircraft 
branded flying consists of operating under our own brand and under the delta prorate 
revenues for this flying are derived from our scheduled air services sold directly to passengers 
we are responsible for local market pricing  scheduling and revenue management  and the operation and maintenance of the aircraft 
under the delta prorate  we earn a prorated portion of the fare plus an incentive for passengers connecting onto delta s network 
aviation services include our ground handling services pursuant to our contracts with continental and other airlines at airport locations across the united states  as well as services  our wholly owned repair and overhaul subsidiary 
during the first half of  we rebranded american composites  intech and saltillo under the name expressjet services 
these entities provide composite  sheet metal  paint  interior including seat refurbishment and thrust reverser repairs throughout our five facilities in the united states and mexico 
revenues are earned and recognized when we complete various jobs and bill our customers for the products and or services delivered 

table of contents a significant portion of our operating expenses and infrastructure is integrated across segments eg  for maintenance  non airport facility rentals  outside services  general and administrative expenses in order to support our entire fleet of aircraft  therefore  we do not allocate these costs to the individual segments identified above  but evaluate them for our consolidated operation 
additionally  due to the transition of our aircraft released from the continental cpa in  we incurred approximately million in transition expenses associated with painting  maintenance modifications and training to ready our operation for flying outside of the continental cpa 
these costs were not included in our measurement of segment profitability as they are expected to be nonrecurring 
we believe that the presentation of our consolidated shared costs and transition costs is consistent with the manner in which these expenses are reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
consequently  the table below presents our operating revenues  including inter segment revenues  and segment profits loss generated per reportable segment for the year ended december  we also included our reconciliation of the consolidated operating revenue to consolidated net loss before taxes and of our total assets at december contract flying branded flying aviation services eliminations consolidated year ended december  revenue from customers direct segment expenses segment profit loss shared expenses  including transition costs interest expense interest income other consolidated loss before income taxes assets at december  segment assets other shared assets total consolidated assets some of the major components of shared expenses are maintenance labor million  general and administrative labor and related expenses million  other general and administrative expenses million  outside services million  and non airport rentals million

the following table details our current non controlling interests that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting carrying amount of investment at december  in millions company wing holdings  llc flight services and systems  inc we purchased a interest in wing holdings  llc wing for million in june the carrying amount of our investment exceeded the amount of the company s underlying equity by approximately million at the time of our investment 
we evaluated the net book value of the company s fixed assets as of june  and identified approximately a million difference between net book value and fair value 
the majority of the difference is being amortized over the remaining average life of the assets identified 
as of december   the balance of the fair value difference  net of amortization  was approximately million 
the remaining million of our difference in the underlying investment is considered goodwill and thus is not amortized 
we review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable 
evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary might include the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity investment  the near and longer term operating and financial prospects of the entity and our longer term intent of retaining the investment in the entity 
management s assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
if the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment 
during fourth quarter  we evaluated and determined that the carrying value of our investment in wing was other than temporarily impaired due to continuing net losses through and the projections of growth were no longer as aggressive as anticipated when we purchased this entity 
therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million comprised primarily of the inherent goodwill 
these impairment charges were recognized as a decrease to our investment balance and corresponding equity loss 
in january  we purchased a interest in flight services and systems  inc fss for million 
at the same time  we loaned the company million which was originally classified in other assets  net  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the note was due and payable in full on september   and provided that interest was due and payable quarterly on the th day following the close of each calendar quarter 
the note provided that if international total services  inc its also owned by the non expressjet owners of fss emerged from bankruptcy and fss could utilize its s federal income tax attributes through a transaction or series of transactions  then any unpaid balance of the note would be deemed paid in full as a contribution by us to the capital of fss 
the loan interest rate was equal to the lesser of per annum or the three month libor plus basis points 
we have not received any additional interest payments since the one made on april   despite the fact that fss did not satisfy all of the requirements under the note to convert the unpaid balance to equity 
we have accrued and reserved fully the interest payments that were due 
additionally  in accordance with our rights under the note  we issued a default notice to fss seeking payment of the past due interest plus the entire principal amount of the note 
fss failed to make the payment of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the default notice and we filed suit to collect the outstanding interest and principal due under the note 
as of december   we have verbally agreed on a resolution with fss and the lawsuit is stayed pending execution of the final documents 
we anticipate a successful outcome and believe the receivable is realizable

we also lease or sublease  under various operating leases  ground equipment and substantially all of our ground facilities  including facilities at public airports from continental or the municipalities or agencies owning and controlling such airports

each holder has the right to require that we repurchase their notes on august   and repurchase dates at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
as one of the repurchase dates is within a year of december   we have reclassified these notes  with outstanding principal amounts of million  net of our repurchases under our securities repurchase program as described below  from long term debt to current liabilities 
we are evaluating our options to satisfy these notes should the holders require us to repurchase the notes in  including the possibility of a secured financing transaction to raise the cash necessary to purchase the notes for cash 
at our option  we may pay the repurchase price in cash  shares of our common stock  or any combination thereof  however  we cannot provide assurance that sufficient financing can be obtained to satisfy the notes in cash 
the notes are our general unsubordinated  unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unconditional basis by airlines 
except as otherwise specified in the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued  there are no restrictions on airlines ability to transfer funds to holdings in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
general provisions of applicable state law  however  may limit the ability of any subsidiary to pay dividends or make distributions to its parent in certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  in principal amount at maturity of the notes 
this conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
holders of the notes may convert all or a portion of their notes into shares of our common stock under the following circumstances i at any time during or after any fiscal quarter commencing after september  if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the fiscal quarter prior to such quarter is greater than of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last day  ii subject to certain exceptions  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each of the five trading days was less than of the product of the closing sales price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  iii if the notes have been called for redemption  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
we have registered sufficient shares of our common stock to be issued upon conversion of these notes 
additionally  we have the right to redeem the notes for cash  as a whole at any time or from time to time in part  beginning on august   for a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
if we elect to use shares of common stock to repurchase any notes  the number of shares will be equal to the repurchase price divided by of the average closing sales price of our common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third business day prior to the applicable repurchase date adjusted to take into account the occurrence of certain events that would require adjustment of the conversion rate 
if the market value of our common stock deteriorated significantly at the time the convertible notes could be put to us  we might not have sufficient shares to fully settle the notes in stock and therefore  would settle the notes in a combination of stock and cash  which could require additional financing 
as of december  and december   we estimated the fair value of our million and million carrying value fixed rate debt to be million and million  respectively  based upon quoted market prices

this receivable primarily represents income tax refunds from prior years resulting from the carryback and application of operating losses against past years income 
we anticipate receiving this amount during all other potential income tax benefits from our operating losses are recorded as deferred tax assets as our ability to receive additional income tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
the amount of these deferred tax assets as of december  was million of federal operating loss carryforwards  federal minimum tax credit carryforwards  million of international loss carryforwards and an additional million of state loss carryforwards

table of contents in october  continental entered into a final settlement agreement with the irs that included periods during which we were included in its consolidated federal income tax return 
our taxable income was not adjusted  but the amount of net operating losses allocated to us was increased by approximately million 
in accordance with our tax agreement with continental  we paid continental approximately million for the increase of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we adjusted our tax accounts for the increase in our federal net operating loss which was fully utilized in our tax year 
in conjunction with our initial public offering in april  the tax basis of our tangible and intangible assets was adjusted to fair value 
this adjustment to tax basis should result in additional tax deductions being available to us through in accordance with our tax agreement with continental  to the extent we generate taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions  we are required to pay continental a percentage of the amount of tax savings actually realized  excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks 
we are required to pay continental of the first third of the anticipated tax benefit  of the second third and of the last third 
however  if the tax benefits are not realized by the end of  we will be obligated to pay continental of any benefit realized after that date 
since these payments are solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets  they are recorded as an obligation to continental within the deferred tax asset accounts  and the portion we may retain in the future is offset by a valuation allowance 
at the time of the initial public offering  the valuation allowance and the obligation to continental offset the step up in basis of assets in our long term deferred tax asset account 
we made approximately million of net payments to continental under the tax agreement related to the additional tax deductions during there were no payments made to continental under the tax agreement during the tax agreement requires continental to reimburse us for any net increase in our cash tax payments resulting from any decreased availability of net operating loss carryovers related to the basis increase at the time our payment occurs 
the resulting receivable and or payable is recorded within the deferred tax asset account since its performance is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income 
our tax agreement increases our dependence on continental s financial condition 
if it is determined that any of the tax benefits related to the basis increase should not have been available at the time of utilization and  as a result  we are required to pay additional taxes  interest and penalties  then we could be adversely affected if continental were unable to indemnify us under the agreement 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no

table of contents treasury stock 
in july  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
purchases have been made from time to time in the open market  the timing of any share repurchases under the program depends on a variety of factors  including market conditions  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
common stock acquired through the program is available for general corporate purposes 
the following table details annual activity under the share repurchase program 
shares repurchased in thousands average cost per share shares forfeited under our stock based compensation plans are held as treasury stock  which can be used to issue new restricted stock and to satisfy any exercises of stock options 
note stock based compensation plans as of december   we had three stock based compensation plans the expressjet holdings  inc and stock incentive plans the incentive plans and the expressjet holdings  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp 
these incentive plans provide that we may grant awards in the form of stock options or restricted stock to our non employee directors  our employees or employees of our subsidiaries 
the incentive plan also provides that we may grant awards in the form of performance units  stock appreciation rights  or any other right  interest or option related to shares or other property  including cash 
the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the incentive plans may not exceed million shares  subject to adjustments as provided in these incentive plans 
we have reserved million shares of our common stock for issuance under this plan 
options granted under these incentive plans have been awarded with exercise prices equaling the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant  vest over a four year period for employees or a six month period for non employee directors and expire seven years after the date of grant in the case of employees and ten years after the date of grant in the case of directors 
prior to  we accounted for our stock based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  if the exercise price of our stock options equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
since our stock options have all been granted with exercise prices that equal fair market value on the grant date  no compensation expense was recognized under apb we also recognized compensation expense for our restricted stock in accordance with apb the total compensation expense incurred for each restricted stock grant equaled the product of the number of shares issued and the closing price of our common stock on the issuance date  the expense was recognized over the vesting period of each grant in accordance with the method specified in financial accounting standards board interpretation no accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
under apb  we did not recognize compensation expense related to the espp 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payments statement r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the twelve months ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested at january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement  and b compensation cost for share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
results for prior periods have not been restated  which is consistent with the transition method selected 

table of contents the fair value of holdings options granted during  and was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make several assumptions 
the table below summarizes the weighted average of these assumptions for the year ended december   and risk free interest rate dividend yield expected market price volatility of our common stock expected life of options years the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to pay them in the future 
the market price volatility of our common stock was based on historical volatility since april   the date of our initial public offering 
our methodology is consistent with prior period volatility assumptions 
the expected life of the options is based upon our anticipated expectations of exercise behavior since no options have been exercised since our initial public offering to provide relevant historical data 
based upon the assumptions above  the weighted average fair value of the options granted during  and was determined to be  and

table of contents as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
on may   our stockholders approved the espp  which authorized the sale of up to one million shares of our common stock 
we have reserved one million shares of our common stock for issuance under the espp 
under the plan  all of our employees are eligible to purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of the semi annual purchase period 
our first purchase period began on july  employees may sell shares obtained under the espp six months after the end of the plan period in which the shares were purchased 
during and   and  shares  respectively  of our common stock were issued to our employees at prices ranging from to in and prices ranging from to in in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to our employees at per share 
the fair value of the purchase rights under the espp was also estimated using the black scholes model with the following assumptions for  and  respectively risk free interest rate of  and  dividend yield of  expected volatility of holdings stock of  and and an expected life of six months 
the weighted average fair value of each purchase right granted in  and was  and  respectively 
prior to the adoption of statement r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows 
statement r requires the cash flows resulting from tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
during the twelve months ended december   no significant stock options were exercised thus having no material effect on the cash flow statement 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share assuming the compensation cost for our stock option  restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans were determined using the fair value method  prorated over the vesting periods in accordance with fin  at the grant dates as required under sfas r for the year ended december  in thousands  except for per share data net income as reported add total stock based compensation expense included in reported net income  net of taxes deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value pro forma basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma 
table of contents on november   our board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of  unvested options currently held by employees  including executive officers  with exercise prices greater than per share and extended the term of  employee options that had five year terms to seven years 
these options were and remain out of the money  and the acceleration and extension were effective immediately 
no options held by non employee directors were subject to acceleration or extension 
the acceleration of vesting reduces compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r 
note employee benefit plans effective december   the expressjet airlines  inc k savings plan k plan was adopted 
substantially all our domestic employees are covered by this plan 
under the plan  we offered the following benefits a retirement match up to of pay per person which vests over five years  and a service based match which vested immediately  depending on years of service and the terms of the collective bargaining agreements  as applicable 
effective october  for airlines mechanics  who are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters  and january  for all other employees  the k plan was amended 
under the amended plan  we offer the following benefits a service based retirement match depending on the years of service from up to of pay per person  which vests over five years  and a service based retirement contribution depending on years of service and the terms of the collective bargaining agreements  as applicable 
effective january   the retirement contribution vesting terms changed from a five year cliff vesting schedule to a year graded vesting schedule 
for the years ended december   and  our total expense for the defined contribution plan was million  million and million  respectively 
the expressjet airlines  inc profit sharing plan the profit sharing plan was adopted effective january  and amended on february  under this plan  if airlines achieves a operating margin  the profit sharing plan will pay out of eligible base pay received during the year to our eligible employees  which excludes employees whose collective bargaining agreements provide otherwise and employees who participate in our management bonus program or any other bonus program designated by the human resources committee of our board 
profit sharing expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
due to our consolidated net operating loss in  no profit sharing expense was recognized 
we also provide medical bridge coverage for employees between the ages of to  with at least years of service who have retired from the company 
on december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of statement statement required the recognition of fund status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of its pension plan in the december  statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the new unrecognized actuarial gain and unrecognized prior service costs 
in december president bush signed the fair treatment for experienced pilots act hr into law 
this law increases the mandatory retirement age of commercial pilots from to as a result of this legislation we no longer are required to provide medical bridge coverage to our pilots between the ages of to and therefore  we have recorded a reduction in our liability and corresponding curtailment gain of million 
our liability for medical bridge coverage for employees at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents note commitments and contingencies capacity purchase agreement 
so long as continental is our largest customer  if we enter into a capacity purchase or economically similar agreement with another major airline defined as any airline with annual revenues greater than million  prior to adjustment for inflation since to provide regional airline service for more than aircraft on terms and conditions that are  in the aggregate  less favorable to us than those in the continental cpa  the continental cpa has a provision that may allow continental to amend its agreement with us to conform to the terms and conditions of our new agreement 
in addition  there are provisions in the continental cpa that require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer  subject to applicable laws  to continental or its designee any of our airport take off or landing slots  route authorities or other regulatory authorizations used for airlines scheduled flights under the agreement 
continental is generally responsible for all capital and start up costs for airport terminal facilities at its hub airports and at any other facilities where it elects to provide baggage handling services to us 
if continental elects to provide baggage handling services at any facility where we previously provided baggage handling services  continental will reimburse us for most of the capital and start up costs we incurred at that facility 
we are generally responsible for any capital and start up costs associated with any airport terminal facilities at other airports where we fly and any non terminal facilities not regularly used by continental 
if we exit a market at the direction of continental and we do not re enter that market under our own code or that of an airline other than continental within six months  continental will reimburse us for certain losses incurred in connection with the closure of the related facility 
if the continental cpa is terminated  we may be required to vacate the terminal facilities or all facilities if the termination results from our material breach of the agreement that are subleased to us by continental  and to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to continental or designee any lease in our name for these facilities 
we began rate discussions with continental last september 
the continental cpa contemplates a november deadline for setting the rates  however  the parties agreed to extend the deadline 
although we believed that we were nearing completion of the rate setting process  continental advised us on february  that if we were unable to reach agreement by march  they might initiate arbitration proceedings again in accordance with the provisions of the continental cpa 
we can also initiate arbitration if we think it necessary 
as of the date of this filing neither party has triggered arbitration and we remain hopeful that it will not be necessary 
continental also advised us that it believes that it overpaid airlines by million in and million in we believe that if we were required to arbitrate these matters we would prevail 
however  we may not be successful in resolving these disputes without reducing our income 
we cannot currently predict the timing or the resolution of these matters 
although we are hopeful that we can agree on rates and resolve continental s other claims without arbitration  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
if we are required to arbitrate  each party will select one arbitrator  and those two arbitrators will select the third arbitrator to complete the panel 
the continental cpa sets forth procedures and a schedule that will likely result in a hearing and the issuance of a final decision by late in the second or early in the third quarter of expressjet will continue to be paid under the block hour rates during the arbitration process and expects the decision setting the revised rates to be retroactive to january  purchase commitments 
as of december   we had options for erj xr aircraft that may be exercised for other types of aircraft within the erj family 
our next option exercise date is august  if we do not exercise or extend our option as of this date  options will expire 
during  continental declined the right to include any of these option aircraft in the continental cpa 
we retain the right to exercise them and fly these aircraft for other airlines or under our own code  subject to some restrictions  however  we will have to finance our acquisition of these aircraft independently 
currently  we do not have any firm commitments for aircraft purchases 

table of contents prior to december  under our power by the hour agreement with rolls royce  we were obligated to acquire up to three spare engines to support our existing aircraft and the remaining eight aircraft on firm order 
in december  we negotiated the sale of eight engines to rolls royce and  in exchange  entered into seven new engine leases with a rolls royce subsidiary 
the engines leased have greater interchangeability than the engines sold 
as a result  we have satisfied our engine obligations and are no longer obligated to purchase the three engines 
these leases are classified as operating leases  hence they are not reflected as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we also have other contractual obligations of approximately billion under our power by the hour contracts with various service providers 
the power by the hour contracts dictate the method by which we pay a vendor based on our actual level of operations in exchange for vendor coverage on specific parts and equipment on our aircraft when those parts and equipment are in need of repair or replacement 
each contract varies in term and payment procedure 
the estimated amount of our future commitment is based on assumptions related to future level of operations and forecasted payment rates 
our level of operations  under the continental cpa  is determined by continental  which has exclusive scheduling authority over our fleet under the continental cpa 
the level of operations inherent in the estimate is based on continental s most recent operating plan for us  which can be altered at continental s sole discretion and included operations for the aircraft exiting the continental cpa 
forecasted payment rates are based on actual rates as of december  and increased annually according to the particular inflation indices detailed in each contract 
contractual rate increases at actual time of occurrence may be different than the forecasted rates 
see a summary of all our contractual obligations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital commitments contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
general guarantees and indemnifications 
pursuant to the continental cpa  we indemnify continental for certain of our actions and it indemnifies us for some of its actions 
additionally  we are party to many contracts  in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but typically excludes liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities 
however  we expect to be covered by insurance for a material portion of these liabilities  subject to deductibles  policy terms and condition 
employees 
as of december   approximately of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
our contracts with our pilots  dispatchers  flight attendants  and mechanics will be amendable in december  july  august and august  respectively 
our contract with our production workers does not have a term but salaries are typically renegotiated each year 
our other employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
credit card holdback 
under our american express credit card processing agreement  certain proceeds from advance ticket sales are held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur 
these holdbacks  which are included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet  totaled approximately million as of december  the funds held back by american express are interest bearing and are subsequently made available to us as air travel is completed 

table of contents the agreement with our visa and mastercard processor also contains financial triggers that require  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios and levels of operating income and unrestricted cash 
the level of credit card holdback is subject to adjustments based on specific financial triggers as discussed in the preceding sentence 
as of december   we did not meet some of the financial ratios set forth in the agreement 
as a result  we were subject at that time to a holdback of our visa and mastercard advance ticket sales 
this holdback  which is included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet  totaled approximately million as of december  upon re measurement in march  our holdback requirement increased to 
we anticipate this could increase our holdback amount to approximately million in initially 
the funds held back are interest bearing and will be made available to us as air travel is completed 
legal proceedings 
we are a defendant in various lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
while the outcome of these lawsuits and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  we do not believe that the ultimate disposition of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

under our amended master facility and ground handling agreement with continental  rent expenses are allocated to us at the airport locations where airlines operates 
additionally  all terminal facility rents at the hub airports are now borne by continental and airlines pays for incremental rent at other continental managed locations unless continental does not operate any aircraft there 
in these situations  airlines is responsible for the rent expense
