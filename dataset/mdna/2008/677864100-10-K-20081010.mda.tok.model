item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and  to a lesser extent  other sorbent materials 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments  the retail and wholesale products group and the business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
we reported net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   an increase over net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income was positively impacted by increases in our average net selling price and total tons sold 
during fiscal we raised selling prices to contend with cost increases in energy and other commodities 
we were impacted by increases in the costs of diesel fuel used to transport our products  natural gas and recycled fuel oil used to dry our clay and paper and resin materials used to package our products 
our ongoing procurement cost savings programs and manufacturing efficiency improvements helped address these cost challenges 
we also continued to strongly support research and development to improve our existing products and processes and to develop new products 
despite these cost saving efforts and selling price increases  our margins declined during fiscal the retail and wholesale products group operates in a highly competitive marketplace and was unable to raise selling prices to the extent of the increased costs 
the business to business products group benefited from opportunities in domestic markets  including the biodiesel industry  and from opportunities in the global marketplace due to the weak us dollar relative to many foreign currencies 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal both our retail and wholesale products group and our business to business products group contributed to the sales improvement 
our focus on strategic pricing company wide to contend with rising costs resulted in an increased average net selling price 
in addition  total tons sold for fiscal year increased 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal net income was positively impacted by higher net selling prices  increased tons sold and an  reduction in cost of sales from the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income was negatively affected by higher freight  materials and packaging costs 
freight costs increased significantly due to record high fuel prices which impacted our truck  rail and ship distribution channels 
materials costs were driven upward by the high cost of fuel used to dry our clay based products and to transport raw materials 
the cost of purchased packaging materials increased due to price increases in the resin and paper markets 
the business to business products group contributed to the improved net income as higher net selling prices overcame lower volume and increased costs  however  in the retail and wholesale products group the higher costs prevailed over increases in both net selling prices and volume 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal total tons sold for the group were down compared to fiscal  however  higher net selling prices provided for increased sales in fiscal net sales of fluids purification products  co packaged cat litter products and animal health and nutrition products all increased 
net sales of bleaching earth and fluids purification products increased due to higher net selling prices and more tons sold 
the increased tonnage was the result of additional business opportunities in both domestic and export markets and in the biodiesel production industry 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were up in fiscal selling price increases and a new co packaging customer offset a decline in tons sold 
tons sold decreased as coarse cat litter sales continued to decline in the overall cat litter market while scoopable cat litter sales continued to increase 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose primarily due to increased tons sold and increased net selling prices for our mycotoxin binder and animal feed binder products 
in contrast  net sales of agricultural chemical carriers were down due to lower tons sold caused by continued market erosion from the growth of genetically modified seed and seed treatments 
tons sold for the group s flo fre product line a by product of the manufacture of our agricultural chemical carriers also declined  however  the impact of lower volume was offset by a higher net selling price which resulted in an increase in net sales 
net sales of sports field products were down as the result of the loss of a customer 
the business to business products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal selling prices increases were partially offset by approximately higher combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
freight costs increased approximately due to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs were driven upward by price increases in the resin and paper markets 
selling and administrative expenses were only higher in fiscal compared to fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  reported in fiscal the net sales growth was driven by increases in both overall net selling prices and tons sold 
the group s total tons sold were up  including an increase in cat litter tons 
net sales of private label cat litter increased due to selling price increases and more volume 
the higher volume was the result of expanded distribution to existing customers  as well as distribution to new customers 
the group s net sales were also positively impacted by reduced trade spending costs trade spending costs are reported as a reduction of net sales 
partially offsetting these net sales increases was a reduction in branded cat litter net sales due to loss of a customer 
net sales of synthetic and clay based industrial absorbents were also both down due to lower volume 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to higher costs 
the group s combined freight  materials and packaging costs increased approximately during fiscal record high fuel prices resulted in freight costs approximately higher than in fiscal the group s product margins were also negatively impacted by higher packaging and materials costs as described above 
these higher costs exceeded the improvement in the group s net sales 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal cost of sales for fiscal was reduced by  as a result of the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which increased our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal by approximately 
increased net selling prices in fiscal did not overcome increased freight  materials and packaging costs 
gross profit was further reduced by a increase in the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from the in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in expenses for the estimated incentive bonus  advertising  audit fees and bad debt 
the lower fiscal incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each year 
advertising costs were higher in fiscal due to packaging re design and market research costs 
audit expense was higher in fiscal when we became an accelerated filer and were required for the first time to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of bad debt expense was higher in fiscal due to the write off of a receivable from a sports product customer 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates that offset the benefits of higher average investment balances 
other income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal other income in fiscal included proceeds received from life insurance policies on former employees 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal primarily due to an increased deduction for mining depletion 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from the fiscal year end balances primarily due to increased accounts receivable  investments in treasury securities and inventories 
these increases were partially offset by decreased cash and cash equivalents 
these changes are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
other assets increased  from fiscal due to the  purchase of strategic intangible assets for the retail and wholesale products group and a lease receivable relating to a co packaging agreement for the business to business products group 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  was consistent with the year end balance in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately equal to depreciation expense 
total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal noncurrent liabilities decreased  due to payment on long term debt 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in the accrued postretirement benefits and deferred compensation  as described in notes and  respectively  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july   were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal our retail and wholesale products group drove the sales improvement 
we focused on strategic pricing company wide in an effort to recover declining margins 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal a increase in operating income for the retail and wholesale products group was a major contributor to the net income growth 
the business to business products group reported lower net sales and operating income in fiscal due to the declining market for agricultural chemical carriers 
this group was also impacted more by increases in costs of materials 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  a decrease of  from net sales of  in fiscal net sales of agricultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and co packaged products all declined 
agricultural chemical carrier net sales decreased due to lower volume as genetically modified seed and other seed treatments continued to erode the market for these carriers 
the decrease in carrier production also decreased the availability of the group s flo fre product line because our flo fre product is a by product of the manufacture of our agricultural chemical carriers  which in turn caused a further decline in net sales 
animal health and nutrition net sales decreased due to the discontinued production of our poultry guard product during the second quarter of fiscal  however  the discontinuation of this product did not have a material impact on net income 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were down in fiscal coarse cat litter sales have declined in the overall cat litter market as scoopable cat litter sales have increased 
in contrast  sports field products net sales were up and volume was up 
the sports field product sales increase was driven by strong sales of baseball products and price increases 
fluids purification products also reported a net sales increase due to higher prices and improved sales in certain overseas markets 
the business to business products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal although prices were higher in fiscal  the price increases did not overcome higher costs and the overall volume decline for the group 
costs in fiscal were up approximately for freight  for packaging and for materials compared to fiscal increased selling and administrative expenses accounted for about a reduction in income 
additional commission expense and a large bad debt charge were recorded in fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  reported in fiscal the growth was driven by sales of private label cat litter 
private label cat litter net sales were up compared to fiscal due to price increases and higher volume 
the volume increase was due to both new distribution and new product offerings 
net sales of synthetic based industrial absorbents were up due to higher selling prices 
our clay based floor absorbent net sales increased due to higher prices which overcame a decline in volume 
our canadian operation s total net sales increased in fiscal the canadian net sales increase was driven by private label cat litter products due to higher prices and new products 
better management of trade promotions during fiscal also increased net sales for the group 
partially offsetting these sales increases was a reduction in branded cat litter net sales due to lower volume 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal price increases  trade promotion changes and lower packaging costs overcame higher freight costs 
packaging costs were approximately lower than fiscal due to procurement cost savings initiatives 
materials costs in fiscal were up slightly with the prior year 
freight costs were up approximately compared to fiscal consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal price increases  trade promotion changes and other cost savings initiatives were implemented in an attempt to bring our margins back to more historical levels 
although freight and materials costs continued to rise  packaging costs decreased in fiscal due to procurement cost savings efforts 
further contributing to the improved gross profit was a decrease in the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process in fiscal compared to fiscal  however  non fuel manufacturing costs rose approximately  which had a negative impact on gross profit 
non fuel manufacturing costs increased for repairs  labor  electricity and other raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from the reported in fiscal the increase in fiscal expenses was primarily due to an increase in expenses for the estimated discretionary incentive bonus  audit fees  stock based compensation and bad debt 
the higher incentive bonus expense was based on the improved results in fiscal additional audit expense was incurred to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of now that we have met the accelerated filer market capitalization threshold 
stock based compensation expense increased due to the additional expense recorded relating to the stock split as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
bad debt expense in fiscal included the write off of a receivable from a sports product customer 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower due to a gain on sale of water rights described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for fiscal increased  from fiscal due to the new debt issuance described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the new debt issuance on december  was outstanding for twelve months in fiscal and for only seven and a half months in fiscal interest income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to increased interest rates in the market and increased average investment balances 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to insurance proceeds on life insurance policies on former employees and royalty income from the use of a trademark 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the tax expense for fiscal included a  tax impact for the repatriation of previously accumulated untaxed foreign earnings and profits which increased our fiscal effective tax rate by 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from the fiscal year end balances due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
these changes are described in liquidity and capital resources below 
conversely  prepaid overburden removal decreased due to the  pre tax write off upon implementation of eitf described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in investments in treasury securities is due to timing of transfers to investments from cash and cash equivalents 
inventories decreased due to a concerted effort to reduce packaging inventory levels  lower fuel inventory and cost reduction initiatives 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  from the year end balance in fiscal vehicles increased due to the purchase of motor equipment used in mining operations and land increased due to the purchase of mining property 
buildings  machinery  equipment and office furniture decreased due to a comprehensive fixed asset inventory which resulted in a write off of assets and their corresponding accumulated depreciation 
the write offs had no significant financial impact because most assets were fully depreciated 
construction in progress decreased as a large project in process at fiscal year end was placed in service during fiscal total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal noncurrent liabilities decreased  mostly due to payment on long term debt 
current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal  due to an increase in accrued salaries 
accrued salaries included a higher incentive bonus accrual based on the improved financial results for fiscal the audit expense accrual  included in other accrued expenses  was higher due to additional expense to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of now that we have become an accelerated filer  however  lower accruals relating to packaging and fuel inventories offset the audit accrual increase resulting in an overall decrease in other accrued expenses 
in addition  accrued trade spending decreased due to timing and reduction of promotions 
accounts payable also decreased due to normal timing of payments and reduction of packaging inventory levels 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents an increase of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company net sales 
net sales increased in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
our canadian subsidiary s net sales increase was primarily due to a higher net selling price that overcame lower tons sold 
the lower volume was primarily in private label cat litter sales due to the loss of a customer 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported net income of  an increase of  from the  net income reported in fiscal net selling price increases improved results for both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
our canadian subsidiary also obtained a greater portion of a raw material from an alternative lower cost source during fiscal our swiss subsidiary reported lower income taxes in fiscal due to additional taxes recognized in fiscal related to the repatriation of untaxed earnings 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july   were  compared to  as of july  most of the increase in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents an increase of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company net sales 
this increase in net sales was seen in our canadian subsidiary  while our united kingdom subsidiary s net sales were flat with fiscal our canadian subsidiary s net sales increase was driven by private label cat litter products 
the introduction of new products and higher prices improved private label cat litter sales 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported net income of  an increase of  from the  net income reported in fiscal price increases helped overcome higher costs in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july   were  compared to  as of july  most of the increase in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  the purchasing and upgrading of real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july   there were no outstanding borrowings under our  revolving credit facility with harris na the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations decreased  in fiscal to  the decrease was primarily due to increases in other assets and changes in working capital  partially offset by an increase in other noncurrent liabilities 
the increase in other assets was primarily due to a lease receivable relating to a co packaging agreement in the business to business products group 
other noncurrent liabilities increased due to higher postretirement benefits liabilities  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by operations increased  in fiscal to  the increase was primarily due to increases in net income during fiscal  loss on sale of fixed assets  non cash stock compensation expense  other non cash charges and changes in working capital 
the changes in the primary components of working capital that impacted operating cash flows for these years were as follows accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due in part to strong fiscal fourth quarter net sales which were greater than fiscal fourth quarter net sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due in part to strong fiscal fourth quarter net sales which were greater than fiscal fourth quarter net sales 
inventories increased by  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end reflecting the higher cost of materials  packaging and fuel and increased inventory levels 
inventory levels increased due to production planning and service level requirements 
inventories decreased at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end by  due to a concerted effort to reduce packaging inventory levels  lower fuel inventory and procurement cost reduction initiatives 
accounts payable increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher costs for purchased items  particularly energy and packaging  and timing of payments 
accrued expenses decreased  the incentive bonus accrual at fiscal year end was lower based on the level of achievement against the fiscal year s performance target 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher freight accrual due to increased costs 
accounts payable decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to timing of payments 
accrued expenses increased  due to a higher incentive bonus accrual at fiscal year end based on the higher level of achievement against that year s performance target 
the audit expense accrual in fiscal was also higher due to additional expense to comply for the first time with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of partially offsetting these increases were lower accrued expense for packaging and fuel due to the lower inventory levels and a decrease in accrued trade spending 
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal during fiscal  net purchases of investment securities were  compared to net dispositions of  in fiscal during fiscal  we modified our investment strategy to allocate a greater portion of our financial resources to investments versus cash 
purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are also subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
during fiscal  we also used  to purchase strategic intangible assets in the retail and wholesale products group 
capital expenditures were  lower in fiscal compared to fiscal cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal capital expenditures were  lower in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included a large project to increase plant production capacities 
during fiscal  net dispositions of investment securities were  compared to net purchases of debt and investment securities of  during fiscal in fiscal  cash available from new long term debt financing was used for investment purchases 
net cash used in provided by financing activities cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we used cash in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt and dividends 
dividend payments were  higher in fiscal in contrast  proceeds from issuance of treasury stock and common stock during fiscal were  higher as a result of more stock option exercise activity 
cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal we used cash in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt and dividends 
both of these amounts were higher than similar payments in fiscal in addition  proceeds from issuance of treasury stock and common stock during fiscal were lower compared to fiscal due to less stock option exercise activity 
other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
cash and investment balances have grown due to normal business operations 
certain investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were liquidated in fiscal to facilitate the repatriation of previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits 
we received cash grants of approximately  in fiscal from the state of illinois 
we used these grants to enhance processing capabilities at our mounds  illinois production facility 
these funds were accounted for on a net grant accounting basis  therefore they were not shown as a cash in flow or a capital expenditure outflow 
the grant funds were completely utilized at the end of the fiscal year 
as part of the normal course of business  we guarantee certain debts and trade payables of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these arrangements are made at the request of the subsidiaries creditors  as separate financial statements are not distributed for the wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of july  the value of these guarantees was  of lease liabilities and  of long term debt 
the  of long term debt was repaid in full on october  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris n 
a on january   pursuant to which we may borrow up to  from time to time 
our payment obligations under this credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions including a limitation on capital expenditures  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to acquire or dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  there were no outstanding borrowings and we had  available under this credit facility and we were in compliance with our covenants 
while there can be no assurance regarding the terms  timing or consummation of any successor agreement  on or before the expiration of this agreement on january   we expect to enter into a successor credit arrangement with harris na or another financing source containing terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to us 
in light of recent financial and credit market developments  the ability to draw on or to enter into any credit arrangement is uncertain 
we believe that cash flow from operations and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
our revolving credit facility provides an additional source of cash funds but would not be required to meet our foreseeable cash needs in the next months 
we expect cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to increase by over  from fiscal due to significant investment in our manufacturing facilities 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt     interest on long term debt     operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   we are not required to make a contribution to our defined benefit pension plan in fiscal we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years after years other commercial commitments    total commercial commitments    the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
annually we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid overburden  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
stock split effected by a stock dividend 
our board declared a stock dividend on june   during our fiscal year the stock dividend was paid in fiscal  on september   to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  accordingly  shares outstanding  income loss per share  dividends per share  common stock price ranges and balance sheet values for all years presented reflect the five for four stock split effected by a stock dividend of one quarter share for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock and the adjustment to aggregate par value has been made 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the allowance not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
the lower fiscal reserve is due to a concerted effort to identify and dispose of obsolete inventory 
overburden removal and mining costs 
a significant part of our mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non usable material from the mine site  thus exposing the sorbent material that is then used in a majority of our production processes 
beginning in fiscal  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry  the costs associated with overburden removal were treated as variable inventory production costs and were included in cost of sales in the period incurred 
prior to fiscal  the cost of overburden removal was recorded in a prepaid expense account and  as the usable sorbent material was mined  the prepaid overburden removal expense was amortized over the estimated usable material 
the amount of available material was estimated using surveys and topographical maps of the mining areas and professional judgment of mining engineers 
additionally  it is our policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights  including associated legal fees  survey fees and real estate fees 
the costs of obtaining mineral patents  including legal fees and drilling expenses  are also capitalized 
pre production development costs on new mines and any prepaid royalties that may be offset against future royalties due upon extraction of the mineral are also capitalized 
all exploration related costs are expensed as incurred 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our overburden removal activities we perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and with fasb interpretation no 
as amended  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions and advertising 
we routinely commit to one time or on going trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
advertising costs include printed materials  participation in industry conventions and shows and market research 
advertising costs for print media are expensed when the advertising occurs 
all other advertising costs are expensed when incurred 
all advertising costs are part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending and advertising programs 
we recorded liabilities of  and  for trade promotions and advertising at july  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
on august   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date and the recognition in the financial statements of the related compensation expense over the appropriate vesting period 
under sfas r  we now recognize expense for stock options and restricted stock issued under our long term incentive plans 
we adopted sfas r using a modified prospective application 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
the fair value of stock based compensation was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
this method requires management to make certain estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized share based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
these amounts include expense related to stock option grants and amortization of restricted stock 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including two critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate for fiscal is the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
in fiscal and  the discount rate assumption was a benchmark rate based on the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
as of july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas require the funded status of our defined pension and postretirement health benefit plans to be recognized on the balance sheet 
in addition  changes in the funded status that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost are recognized within other comprehensive income  net of income tax 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could effect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the fiscal valuation allowance increased due to higher alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  since it is considered more likely than not that the benefit of these credits will not be realized

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of july  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar euro and us dollar canadian dollar  as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
foreign currency denominated accounts receivable is a small fraction of our consolidated accounts receivable 
we are also subject to translation exposure of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
in recent years  our foreign subsidiaries have not generated a substantial portion of our consolidated sales or net income 
we do not enter into any hedge contracts in an attempt to offset any adverse effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
we believe that the foreign currency fluctuation risk is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluids purification  agricultural and animal health markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we plan to contract for approximately half of our anticipated fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices 
we will also consider purchasing contracts for a portion of our fuel requirements for future years 
all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
as of july   we have purchased natural gas contracts representing approximately of our planned kiln fuel needs for fiscal we estimate the weighted average cost of these natural gas contracts in fiscal to be approximately higher than the contracts in fiscal  however  this average will change as we continue to buy natural gas contracts in accordance with our forward purchase program 
the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts  the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected fair value maturity natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market 
please also see item a above  risk factors  for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
