revenue from training  support and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company s most current user manuals 
the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which the company is already obligated to provide  and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 
the company s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company s software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including the company s right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  the company has not established any related reserves 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin 
in determining these percentages  the company analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer s industry and geographic region 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded which would reduce the provision for income taxes 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin  on january  as a result of this adoption  the company recognized approximately a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings of million and an increase to the january  balance of goodwill of million 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  the company expects sfas no 
r will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 
million of the million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by the company 
if such liabilities are settled for lesser amounts prior to the adoption of sfas r  the reversal of any remaining liability will affect goodwill 
if such liabilities reverse subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  such reversals will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal 
the company is still assessing the full impact of this standard on its future consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or  in the case of goodwill  the company s single reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies 
in preparing the estimate of fair value  the company relies on a number of factors  including historical operating results  business plans  anticipated future cash flows  economic projections and other market data 
because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors  the company s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 
the company is involved in various investigations  claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company reviews the status of these matters  assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation  claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates  the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change 
the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company s stock option plan 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company s common stock at a discount under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of statement no 
r 
effective january   the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of statement no 
r with a modified prospective application  which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
prior to this adoption  the company had elected to account for stock based compensation arrangements through the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is measured as the excess  if any  of the market value of the underlying common stock over the amount the employee is required to pay on the date both the number of shares and the price to be paid are known 
for the years ended december   no compensation expense had been recognized in the consolidated statements of income as option grants generally were made with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the award date  which was typically the date of compensation measurement 

table of contents the valuation provisions of statement no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
share based compensation expense recognized under statement no 
r for and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during  and represented  and  respectively  of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during  and represented  and  respectively  of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year 
based on the requirements in statement no 
r  the value of each share based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model  which is the same model that was used for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under statement no 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the compensation expense recorded within the company s consolidated statement of income in compliance with statement no 
r as of december  and and those used in presenting the pro forma information included within the footnotes of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the interest rates used were determined by using the five year treasury note yield on the date of grant 
assumption used in black scholes option pricing model compensation expense december  compensation expense december  pro forma disclosure december  risk free interest rate to to expected dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options  however  incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options 
the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable  as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company 
statement no 
r requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event 
the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected 
in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options  the company makes many assumptions and estimates  including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees  the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company s stock price on the exercise dates 
each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty 
additionally  a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense  especially in the periods most closely following the adoption date of statement no 
r 
although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company s tax filings  this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income 
for example  the company realized a tax benefit of million during the year ended december  related to disqualified incentive stock options  however  only  of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 
although there are significant limitations in estimating the impact of statement no 
r  including those discussed above  the company currently estimates that the impact of statement no 
r will be a decrease in operating income of approximately million million and a decrease in net income of approximately million million  or approximately per diluted share 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of statement no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that the company will record under statement no 
r may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
therefore  it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under statement no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because the company s share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company s estimates of fair values  in the company s opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company s share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that the company s estimates of the fair values of the company s share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  
table of contents may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with statement no 
r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to the company s financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company 
for this reason  and because the company does not view share based compensation as related to its operational performance  the board of directors and management exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the company s underlying business performance 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement no 
r as of january  the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  typically the vesting period
