in addition  the company continues to sell its legacy products and pursue business in the commercial market 
engineering expenses are also projected to decline as the development phase of the an usm program nears completion

the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer provided title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
revenues for repairs and calibrations of the company s products are recognized when the units are shipped 
due to the unique nature of the itats program wherein a significant portion of this contract will not be delivered over a year  revenues under this contract are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
all expenses related to this contract are charged to cost of sales

inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty enhancement costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty enhancement costs could be in excess of our warranty enhancement reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty enhancement reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty enhancement claim experience differs from estimates 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified
