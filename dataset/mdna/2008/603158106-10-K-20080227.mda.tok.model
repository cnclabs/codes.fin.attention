item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold production margin marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses impairment of assets restructuring charges income loss from operations income loss before provision for taxes on income  minority interests and discontinued operations provision for taxes on income minority interests income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss executive summary during the third quarter of  the company completed an in depth strategic review of all its operations to determine the company s future direction  structure  business portfolios and technologies for improved financial performance 
as a result of this review  the company realigned its operations by exiting certain businesses  and consolidating some product lines 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment of assets charge of million  of which million was reclassified to discontinued operations 
in addition  in the company recorded restructuring and other costs of million related to these exit activities  of which million was reclassified to discontinued operations 
these restructuring costs were primarily related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  or about seven percent of the company s global workforce 
the major components of the realignment were as follows synsil products the company has exited its synsil products product line and will sell its synsil products manufacturing facilities in chester  south carolina  cleburne  texas  and the customer sampling facility in woodville  ohio 
this resulted in an impairment of assets charge of approximately million  which is included in discontinued operations 
we have concluded that synsil  in its current product form  is not suitable to penetrate a significant portion of the market previously envisioned 
the initial success achieved in certain market segments proved unsustainable at higher operating fill rates for major glass market segments 
processed minerals and specialty pcc the company will realign these product lines  which consists of four mines and processing facilities in the united states  two plants in the midwest that process imported ores  and the specialty pcc product line 
the two midwest plants in mt 
vernon  indiana  and wellsville  ohio  acquired in  which primarily process chinese talc ores  will be held for sale and are included in discontinued operations 
this realignment will result in a change of direction from diversified product lines that included processing imported ore to an integrated mine to market strategy 
the company recorded impairment of assets charges of approximately million related to the realignment of the processed minerals product line  of which million was included in discontinued operations 
going forward  four fully integrated operations will be the focus of the mine to market strategy  three of which produce ground calcium carbonate  primarily for the construction and automotive sectors 
these are in adams  massachusetts  canaan  connecticut  and lucerne valley  california 
the fourth facility mines and produces talc in barretts  montana 
the company also will consolidate its specialty pcc operation in the united states 
the majority of specialty pcc customers serviced from the brookhaven  mississippi  facility will be transferred to the company s adams  massachusetts  plant and the assets at brookhaven will be held for sale 
this resulted in an impairment of assets charge of approximately million related to the closing of the brookhaven  mississippi facility 
the company will continue to operate its specialty pcc facility in lifford  england 
european coating pcc the company will modify the marketing strategy for its coating pcc products and will convert from a merchant business model to a satellite business model for coating pcc  one that has proven successful in the past 
this has resulted in consolidation of the coating pcc operations in europe with the closure of our pcc merchant facility in hermalle  belgium 
current commercial customers have been transferred to our coating pcc merchant facility in walsum  germany  which will also focus on supporting market development activities for the satellite pcc program 
the company recorded an impairment of assets charge related to the coating development program of approximately million 
refractories segment due to slower than anticipated rate of market penetration  the company has adjusted its strategy for its refractories business in china 
the company will continue to develop new business there but will modify the infrastructure to support a more focused marketing effort 
the company recorded an impairment of assets charge in this segment of approximately million 
additional impairments the pensacola  florida facility will be dismantled after final customer commitments have been met in this resulted in an impairment of assets charge of million 
additional impairment of assets charges of million were also included in the paper pcc product line 
as a result of the aforementioned impairment and restructuring charges  the company recorded a loss from continuing operations of million or per share and a loss from discontinued operations of million or per share 
the company will continue to focus on innovation and new product development and other opportunities for continued growth as follows increasing our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  development of the filler fiber composite program  to increase the fill rate for uncoated freesheet paper  which continues to undergo large scale paper machine trials 
further development of the company s pcc products  filling and coating  for use in the satellite model 
development of unique calcium carbonates used in the manufacture of novel biopolymers  an emerging market opportunity 
rapid deployment of value added formulations of refractory materials that not only reduce costs but improve performance 
leverage the company s expertise in crystal engineering  especially in helping papermakers customize pcc morphologies for specific paper applications 
continuing our penetration in emerging markets through our manufacturing facility in china and our recent acquisition in turkey  both within the refractories segment 
further increasing market penetration in the refractories segment through development of high performance products and equipment systems 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities 
we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our success depends in part on the performance of the industries we serve  particularly papermaking and steel making 
some of our customers may continue to experience consolidations and shutdowns  consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc  most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us  our filler fiber composite technology continues in development through customer trials  but has yet to be proven on a long term commercial scale 
we are subject to cost fluctuations on raw materials  including shipping costs  particularly for magnesia and alumina imported from china  our processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines are highly influenced by the domestic building and construction markets 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns

specialty minerals segment sales increased approximately and refractories segment sales increased approximately in worldwide net sales of pcc  which is primarily used in the manufacturing process of the paper industry  increased to million from million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of approximately million or percentage points of growth 
worldwide net sales of paper pcc increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales growth was attributable to increased selling prices from the pass through to customers of raw material cost increases and to foreign currency 
paper pcc sales volume decreased slightly from the prior year 
increased pcc volumes at several facilities were more than offset by paper industry consolidations  primarily in north america 
sales of specialty pcc grew to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to improved volumes  particularly in europe  and to the favorable effects of foreign currency 
worldwide net sales of pcc increased in to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of paper pcc increased to million while paper pcc volumes grew 
in  sales growth was achieved in all regions  with the largest growth occurring in asia due to the ramp up of two new satellite plants in china 
sales of specialty pcc grew in to million from million in the prior year 
net sales of processed minerals products in decreased to million from million in gcc products and talc products both decreased in to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the processed minerals product line was primarily attributable to weakness in the domestic residential construction industry and the automotive market 
net sales of processed minerals products in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to strong global demand in plastics and healthcare related markets within the talc product line 
net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million or percentage points of sales growth 
sales from the turkish acquisition made in late contributed an additional percentage points of growth in sales of refractory products and systems to steel and other industrial applications increased to million in from million in the prior year 
this growth was due to foreign currency and the turkish acquisition 
sales of metallurgical products within the refractories segment decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to lower volumes in all regions of the world  and lower prices resulting from the reduction in the cost of raw materials for this product that is traditionally passed through to the customers 
net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of refractory products and systems increased to million in from million in the prior year 
this growth was attributable to increased volume in north america and europe 
sales of metallurgical products decreased in to million from million in the prior year 
this decline was due to lower selling prices as raw material cost reductions were passed on to customers 
net sales in the united states decreased approximately to million in and represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
international sales increased approximately to million  due primarily to foreign currency and the acquisition in turkey 
operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing and administrative research and development impairment of assets restructuring charges percentage not meaningful cost of goods sold in was of sales compared with in the prior year 
our cost of goods sold grew which had an unfavorable leveraging impact on our sales growth resulting in a increase in production margin 
this unfavorable leveraging occurred in both segments 
in the specialty minerals segment  the production margin increased as compared with sales growth 
this segment has been affected by reduced demand in the processed minerals product line and paper machine and paper mill shutdowns which were partially offset by the recovery of raw material costs and the benefit of foreign currency 
in the refractories segment  the production margin increased as compared with sales growth 
this segment has been affected by lower margins in the metallurgical product line 
cost of goods sold in was of sales compared with of sales in production margin grew as compared with sales growth 
this unfavorable leveraging occurred in the specialty minerals segment where production margins increased as compared with sales growth 
during  margins in this segment were affected by unrecovered lime cost increases and paper machine and paper mill shutdowns in the pcc product line  and unrecovered energy cost increases in the processed minerals product line 
these negative factors largely offset the improvements from the ramp up of our two new satellite pcc facilities in china  increased demand for pcc  particularly in north america and europe  and cost reduction initiatives 
in the refractories segment  production margin increased in over the prior year compared with sales growth 
this was primarily due to improved steel industry conditions in and cost reduction initiatives through the reformulation of refractory products and strong demand for high value products 
marketing and administrative costs were million in  the same as the prior year and represented of net sales as compared with in the prior year 
in  marketing and administrative expenses increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased worldwide infrastructure costs and other employee benefits  including increased stock option expense of million relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
research and development expenses decreased in to million and represented of net sales 
this decrease was a result of the timing of lower trial activity  primarily in the paper pcc product line 
in  research and development expenses increased to million and represented of net sales 
the company initiated a plan to realign its operations as a result of an in depth strategic review of all of its operations 
this realignment resulted in impairment of assets charges and restructuring charges in as follows impairment of assets charges paper pcc specialty pcc total pcc processed minerals specialty minerals segment refractories segment restructuring and other costs severance and other employee benefits contract termination costs other exit costs the restructuring program will result in a reduction of approximately employees 
the impairment of assets charge includes a write down of an intangible asset of million related to customer relationships associated with a recent acquisition in the refractories segment 
income loss from operations dollars in millions growth growth income loss from operations the company recorded a loss from operations in of million as compared with income from operations of million in the prior year 
the loss was primarily attributable to the aforementioned impairment of assets charges and restructuring and other exit costs 
the specialty minerals segment recorded a loss from operations of million as compared with income from operations of million in included in the loss from operations was an impairment of assets charge of million and restructuring and other exit costs of million 
the refractories segment recorded income from operations of million in as compared with million in the prior year

income from operations in increased to million from million in and was of sales as compared with of sales in in  income from operations for the specialty minerals segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
operating income for the refractories segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
this was primarily attributable to increased profitability from refractory products and systems sales  partially offset by a reduction in profitability in metallurgical products 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions decreased in to million from million in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to an insurance recovery gains of approximately million in  million above prior year 
in addition  the company recorded higher interest income of million over prior year as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents in non operating deductions increased in from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased interest expense of million over due to increased borrowings 
in addition  in we recognized an insurance settlement gain of approximately million for property damage sustained at one of our facilities 
in  we recognized a litigation settlement gain of million 
provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the company recorded a provision for income tax of million on a loss before taxes of million in this was primarily attributable to the restructuring and impairment losses recorded in certain jurisdictions in which we were unable to record a tax benefit 
the effective tax rate increased to in as compared with in this increase was primarily related to a change in the mix of earnings  an increase in the valuation allowance due to ohio tax reform legislation and the impact of fas r 
minority interests dollars in millions growth growth minority interests the decrease in the provision for minority interest in was primarily related to a reduction in profitability from our consolidated joint ventures in china 
in  we realized improved profitability in china over lower levels in income loss from continuing operations dollars in millions growth growth income loss from continuing operations the company recognized a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared with income from continuing operations of million in the loss in was due to the restructuring and impairment of assets charges 
income from continuing operations decreased in to million 
diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations increased to in as compared with in the prior year due to a lower share base from the company s stock repurchase program 
loss from discontinued operations dollars in millions growth growth loss from discontinued operations percentage not meaningful the company has reflected in discontinued operations its synsil product line and its two plants in the midwest that process imported ores 
in  the company liquidated its wholly owned subsidiary in hadera  israel and classified such business as discontinued operations 
the company recognized a loss from discontinued operations in of million as compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
included in the loss from discontinued operations were pre tax impairment of assets charges of million and restructuring and other exit costs of million 
in  the loss from discontinued operations included foreign currency translation losses of million recognized upon liquidation of the company s investment in israel 
net income loss dollars in millions growth growth net income loss the company recorded a net loss of million in as compared with net income of million in the loss in was attributable to impairment of assets and restructuring charges in both continuing operations and discontinued operations 
net income decreased in to million 
earnings per share on a diluted basis decreased to per share in as compared with per share in the prior year 
outlook we are presently experiencing some weakness in certain primary industries we serve paper and construction 
there were several paper machine shutdowns that affected our satellite pcc product line as the paper industry continues to consolidate and rationalize capacity 
in addition  there is continued softening in the residential construction and automotive markets which is affecting our processed minerals product line 
steel production remains stable with slow growth in our major markets  north america and europe 
however  these markets have faced increased competition from other foreign markets in which the company has a lower market share 
in addition  weakness in the automotive and construction markets could result in reduced demand for this sector 
as a result of realigning and restructuring our operations  we strengthened the basic foundation of our businesses 
we eliminated under performing assets and expect to achieve higher returns on capital and higher rates of profitable growth 
however  we are concerned about the state of the economy and the potential impact it may have on our product lines 
in  we plan to focus on the following growth strategies continued development and potential commercial introduction of filler fiber composite technology for the paper industry to increase the fill rates of uncoated freesheet paper 
increase market penetration of pcc by expanding the satellite model 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
expand regionally into emerging markets where we have a limited presence and increase our presence in regional markets where the manufacturing of paper and steel is shifting  particularly to china and eastern europe 
development of unique calcium carbonates used in the manufacture of biopolymers  an emerging market opportunity 
continue to improve our cost competitiveness in all product lines 
explore selective acquisitions to complement our existing businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
in october  we acquired asmas  an istanbul based turkish producer of refractories based in istanbul  turkey 
this acquisition provides our refractories segment with a strong market position in turkey  as well as manufacturing capability which will enable us to service the rapidly growing markets in the middle east and eastern europe 
as we continue to expand our operations overseas  we face the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems and other factors 
some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  brazil  thailand  china and south africa 
in addition  our performance depends to some extent on that of the industries we serve  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially about ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  generally in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future sales growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate and  if not renewed  could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  to repay short term debt of million and to repurchase million of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities totaled million in as compared with million in the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to an improvement in working capital  as compared to the prior year 
our accounts receivable declined despite a increase in sales  and our days of sales outstanding decreased to days from days in the prior year 
our inventories also declined from the prior year resulting in a reduction of days of inventory on hand from days to days 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on october   our company s board of directors authorized the company s management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on october   the company s board of directors authorized the company s management to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million of additional shares over the next two year period 
as of december   no shares have been purchased under this program 
on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  we anticipate that capital expenditures for should approximate million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million   thereafter million 
the company has contingent obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  asset retirement obligations  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we principally measure any impairment by our ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgements regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgements can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
the company s accounts for stock based compensation expense under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical implied volatility of the company s stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set our anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and the accuracy of assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions in item a  risk factors 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on our financial position or results of operations

however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between january and july of the fair value of these instruments at both december  and december  was a liability of million
