overview worthington industries  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  we  our  worthington  or the company  is primarily a diversified metal processing company  focused on value added steel processing and manufactured metal products  such as metal framing  pressure cylinders  automotive past model service stampings and  through joint ventures  metal ceiling grid systems and laser welded blanks 
our number one goal is to increase shareholder value  which we seek to accomplish by optimizing existing operations  developing and commercializing new products and applications  and pursuing strategic acquisitions and joint ventures 
as of may   excluding our joint ventures  we operated manufacturing facilities worldwide  principally in three reportable segments steel processing  metal framing and pressure cylinders 
we also held equity positions in ten joint ventures  which operated manufacturing facilities worldwide as of may  each of these segments and key joint ventures hold a leadership position in its respective market 
we have capacity in each of our segments to handle additional sales growth without significantly increasing our capital investment 
for more information on our segments  please refer to item business of part i of this annual report on form k 
the two largest markets we serve are construction and automotive  representing and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal our results are primarily driven by two factors  product demand and the spread between the average selling price of our products and the cost of raw materials  mainly steel 
the spread can be significantly affected by our first in  first out fifo inventory costing method 
in a rising steel price environment  our reported income is often favorably impacted as lower priced inventory acquired during the previous months flows through cost of goods sold while our selling prices increase to meet the rising replacement cost of steel 
in a decreasing steel price environment  the inverse often occurs as higher priced inventory on hand flows through cost of goods sold as our selling prices decrease 
the results from these market dynamics are referred to as inventory holding gains or losses 
we strive to limit the inventory holding impact by controlling inventory levels 
a majority of our full time employees participate in profit sharing and bonus programs which are tied to performance 
generally  when earnings are up  profit sharing and bonus expenses increase  when earnings are down  profit sharing and bonus expenses decrease 
because of this relationship  profit sharing and bonus expenses may somewhat lessen the volatility of our earnings 

table of contents market industry overview logo for our fiscal year ended may  fiscal  our sales breakdown by end user market is illustrated by the chart to the left 
substantially all of the sales of our metal framing segment and the construction services segment  as well as approximately of the sales for the steel processing segment  are to the construction market  both residential and non residential 
we estimate that approximately of our consolidated sales  or one fourth of our construction market sales  are to the residential market 
while the market price of steel significantly impacts this business  there are other key indicators that are meaningful in analyzing construction market demand including us gross domestic product gdp  the dodge index of construction contracts  and trends in the relative price of framing lumber and steel 
construction is also the predominant end market for three of our joint ventures  including our largest  worthington armstrong venture wave 
the sales of these joint ventures are not consolidated in our results  however  adding our ownership percentage of joint venture construction market sales to our reported sales would not materially change the sales breakdown in the chart 
the automotive industry is the largest consumer of flat rolled steel and thus the largest end market for our steel processing segment 
approximately half of the sales of our steel processing segment  and substantially all of the sales of the automotive body panels segment  are to the automotive market 
north american vehicle production  primarily by chrysler  ford and general motors the big three automakers  has a considerable impact on the customers within these two segments 
these segments are also impacted by the market price of steel and  to a lesser extent  the market price of commodities used in their operations  such as zinc  natural gas and diesel fuel 
the majority of the sales of three of our unconsolidated joint ventures also go to the automotive end market 
these sales are not consolidated in our results  however  adding our ownership percentage of joint venture automotive market sales to our reported sales does not materially change the sales breakdown in the previous chart 
the sales of our pressure cylinders and steel packaging segments  and approximately of the sales of our steel processing segment  are to other markets such as appliance  leisure and recreation  distribution and transportation  hvac  lawn and garden  and consumer specialty products 
given the many different product lines that make up these sales and the wide variety of end markets  it is very difficult to list the key market indicators that drive this portion of our business 
however  we believe that the trend in us gdp growth is a good economic indicator for analyzing these segments 

table of contents we use the following information to monitor our cost and major end markets fiscal year ended may  inc dec vs 
vs 
us gdp growth year over year hot rolled steel per ton big three auto build  s vehicles no 
america auto build  s vehicles dodge index framing lumber per  board ft zinc per pound natural gas per mcf retail diesel prices  all types per gallon cru index  annual average csm autobase random lengths  annual average lme zinc  annual average nymex henry hub natural gas  annual average energy information administration  annual average us gdp growth rate trends are generally indicative of the strength in demand and  in many cases  pricing for our products 
historically  we have seen that increasing us gdp growth rates year over year can have a positive effect on our results  as a stronger economy generally improves demand and pricing for our products 
conversely  the opposite is also generally true 
changes in us gdp growth rates can also signal changes in conversion costs related to production and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
however  these are all general assumptions  which do not hold true in all cases 
the market price of hot rolled steel is a significant factor impacting selling prices and can also impact earnings 
in a rising price environment  such as we experienced during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  our results are generally favorably impacted as lower priced material  purchased in previous periods  flows through cost of goods sold  while our selling prices increase at a faster pace to cover current replacement costs 
on the other hand  when steel prices fall  as they did during the first part of fiscal  we typically have higher priced material flowing through cost of goods sold while selling prices compress to what the market will bear  negatively impacting our results 
these are all general assumptions  however  which do not hold true in all cases 
our fifo inventory costing method results in inventory holding gains and losses  which we attempt to limit through inventory management 
no single customer makes up more than of our consolidated net sales 
while our automotive business is largely driven by big three production schedules  our customer base is much broader than the big three automakers and includes many of their suppliers as well 
seasonal automotive shutdowns in july and december can cause weaker demand in our first and third quarters 
domestic automotive sales have been hurt in recent quarters as the rising cost of gasoline has shifted consumer demand to smaller  more fuel efficient vehicles a market historically dominated by foreign manufacturers 
we continue to pursue customer diversification beyond the big three automakers and their suppliers 
the dodge index represents the value of total construction contracts  including residential and non residential building construction 
this overall index serves as a broad indicator of the construction markets in which we participate  as it consists of actual construction starts 
the relative pricing of framing lumber  an alternative construction material with which we compete  can also affect our metal framing segment  as certain applications may permit the use of alternative building materials 
the market trends of certain other commodities such as zinc  natural gas and diesel fuel are important to us as they represent a significant portion of our cost of goods sold  both directly through our plant operations and indirectly through transportation and freight 
a rise in the price of any of these commodities could 
table of contents increase our cost of goods sold 
we attempt to limit the impact of pricing fluctuations through contracts  hedging activities and  specifically for transportation  leveraging opportunities across multiple business units  where available 
as previously stated  residential construction does not make up a large portion of our overall business  about 
however  the slowdown in this industry and the related struggles in the credit markets have negatively affected most of our segments  each to a varying degree 
although much of the impact falls on those segments which directly serve the construction markets  other segments are indirectly impacted by the ripple effect felt in other parts of the economy  for example  in consumer spending and the labor market 
business strategy our first goal is to increase shareholder value 
to accomplish this goal  we focus on driving top line growth  increasing operating margins  and improving asset utilization 
during fiscal  we completed a number of value added growth initiatives which further extend our product lines and penetrate new markets 
these included the following actions on september   our pressure cylinders segment acquired certain cylinder production assets of wolfedale engineering  the largest canadian manufacturer of portable propane gas steel cylinders for use with barbeque gas grills  recreational vehicles  campers and trailers 
these assets and related production were integrated into our existing facilities 
on september   we acquired a interest in serviacero planos  sa de sa serviacero worthington which operates two steel processing facilities in central mexico 
on march   serviacero worthington announced plans to add a greenfield site in the monterrey  mexico  region 
on september   we formed a steel processing joint venture  in which we have an equity interest of  with the magnetto group to construct and operate a class one steel processing facility in slovakia 
this joint venture started operations in february as canessa worthington slovakia sro canessa worthington and services customers throughout central europe 
on october   we acquired a interest in crate and pallet maker lefco industries  llc lefco  a minority business enterprise 
the joint venture  called lefco worthington  llc  lefco worthington will manufacture steel rack systems for the automotive and trucking industries  in addition to lefco s existing product offerings 
on march   twb company  llc twb  our joint venture with thyssenkrupp steel north america  inc thyssenkrupp  acquired thyssenkrupp tailored blanks  sa de sa  the mexican subsidiary of thyssenkrupp  to expand twb s presence in mexico 
as a result  thyssenkrupp now owns of twb and worthington now owns 
to increase our operating margins and asset utilization we began two initiatives  one focused on reducing costs and the other on reviewing the utilization of our facilities in metal framing 
these two initiatives have grown into a much larger transformational effort the transformation plan which now includes the additional initiatives of increasing efficiency throughout the company  and improving our supply chain 
the intent behind these initiatives is to significantly transform the company s earnings potential over the next three years 
at this point  we have identified opportunities to generate an estimated million in annual savings  excluding the expenses related to achieving these savings 
of the savings  million will come from overhead expense reductions with the remaining million coming from announced plant closures in our metal framing segment 
updates on these initiatives are as follows expense reduction we realized million in savings during fiscal however  these savings were almost entirely offset by increases in other expenses  primarily in employee compensation  which increased due to favorable earnings  depreciation expense related to our new enterprise resource planning system  and bad debt expense 
the balance of the savings will come in fiscal with a portion to be realized in fiscal 
table of contents asset utilization on september   we announced the closure or downsizing of five production facilities in our metal framing segment 
the affected facilities were east chicago  indiana  rock hill  south carolina  goodyear  arizona  wildwood  florida  and montreal  canada which is being downsized 
the rock hill facility continues to operate only as a steel processing operation and will also produce product for the aegis joint venture 
in addition to the plant closures  the metal framing corporate offices will be relocated from pittsburgh  pennsylvania  to our corporate offices in columbus  ohio 
annual net sales generated by the closed facilities totaled approximately million  the majority of which are expected to be transferred to other nearby metal framing locations 
as of may   all five of the metal framing operating facilities have been closed or downsized 
of the million in annual savings expected from these actions  million was realized in fiscal the balance will be realized in fiscal restructuring charges related to these closures and the relocation of the executive and administrative offices totaled million in fiscal with an additional million expected in fiscal rapid improvement team we have created a rapid improvement team focused on improving the efficiency at each of our facilities 
they have completed a review of one facility  but it is too early to provide the beneficial impact of their findings 
high performance organization under this initiative we have identified a number of efforts to enhance our talent management and business performance management processes 
those efforts are aimed at driving sustainable performance improvement 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operations the following table presents consolidated operating results fiscal year ended may  dollars in millions of net sales of net sales increase decrease net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expense restructuring charges operating income other expense  net interest expense equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates income tax expense net earnings net earnings for fiscal decreased million from the prior year to million 
net sales increased million to  million from the prior year 
most of the increase in net sales was due to higher volumes million  stronger foreign currencies relative to the us dollar million and a marginal increase in average selling prices 
volume increases boosted sales in nearly all of our segments  especially construction services  where sales increased million 

table of contents gross margin decreased million from the prior year primarily due to declines in our pressure cylinders segment as a result of lower average selling prices in local currencies in europe and increased material costs 
all of our other segments reported increased gross margin due to stronger volumes 
sg a expense decreased million from the prior year 
the transformation plan provided million in sg a savings  which was partially offset by increased compensation  depreciation and bad debt expense 
restructuring charges of million related to the transformation plan 
the transformation plan is being led by company management with the assistance of outside consultants  who specialize in these types of plans 
restructuring charges included asset accelerated depreciation  employee early retirements and severance  facility restoration  equipment relocations  and professional fees 
equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates of million was largely made up of earnings from our wave joint venture  which increased million over the last year 
increased earnings from wave and the addition of earnings from serviacero worthington million were offset by decreased earnings at wsp  twb  and certain other joint ventures
