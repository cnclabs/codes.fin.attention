item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that none of these accounting policies are extraordinarily complex or require an unusual degree of judgment as these policies relate to the company s operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report 
overview transcend services  inc and subsidiary transcend utilize a combination of its proprietary internet based voice and data distribution technology  customer based technology and home based medical language specialists to convert physicians voice recordings into electronic documents 
on january   we purchased medical dictation  inc mdi for million 
the purchase was financed with a million promissory note  million in cash and  of transcend common stock 
in  we repaid million of the promissory note with a combination of cash and transcend common stock  leaving a remaining balance on the mdi promissory note of million  which was outstanding at december  during first quarter of  we repaid the remaining balance on the note 
on december   we entered into a four year  million credit facility with healthcare finance group hfg 
the facility includes a million accounts receivable based revolving promissory note and up to million of term loans to fund acquisitions 
at december   the balance on the facility was  beginning january   the company began including depreciation and amortization as a separate line item in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and prior year information was reclassified to conform to this presentation 
transcend purchased certain assets of otp technologies  inc otp  a chicago area medical transcription company  on january  transcend paid  consisting of  in cash  a  promissory note and   shares of transcend common stock 
transcend  based on the final earn out calculation stemming from revenue  paid  in additional consideration in january our profitability has improved in and due in large part to improved customer retention combined with new sales  increased use of speech recognition technology and increased use of offshore transcription partners 
critical accounting estimates which are material to registrant a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on our knowledge of current events and actions  however  actual results may ultimately differ from estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we reported goodwill and intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the goodwill and intangible assets are associated with two acquisitions during and one during we review goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
as of december   we operate in one reporting unit medical transcription services 
the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use them 
in  million of our net operating loss carryforwards will expire 
we use current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding expected future revenues and expenses 
in addition  we must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable income 
as of december   we have determined that we will more likely than not be able to utilize our deferred tax benefits in the future and accordingly  we have reduced the valuation allowance to zero 
legal proceedings 
from time to time  we are a party to litigation 
on january   we reached a mediated settlement with our lady of the lakes hospital  inc olol which was finalized on february  under the settlement  olol released all claims  in contract and in tort  which were asserted or could have been asserted in the litigation against transcend 
in return  we agreed to pay  which is accrued at december   to olol and released all claims under our counterclaim against olol

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
was effective for our company on january  however  in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
for our financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities  effective january   will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
this statement  which is effective january   permits companies to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and provides the opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we believe that the adoption of this statement in will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas  business combinations 
however  sfas r will require that acquisition costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and also requires the recognition of assets and assumed liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date 
sfas r is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company to date 
however  the effects of inflation on future operating results will depend in part on the company s ability to increase prices or lower expenses  or both  in amounts that offset inflationary cost increases 
contract prices are generally fixed for the duration of the contractual period and typically do not provide for price increases over the term of the contract  which usually extends from one to three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company had no material exposure to market risk from derivatives or other financial instruments as of december  the company does have a floating rate of interest on its credit facility with hfg 
as the company had almost no outstanding debt with hfg at december   a increase in the interest rate would not increase interest expense
