analysis of financial condition loan portfolio our loan portfolio has grown at an annual rate of  and in  and  respectively  reflecting the build up of our lending operations 
our business plan focuses primarily on lending to middle market businesses and high net worth individuals  and as such  commercial and real estate loans have comprised a majority of our loan portfolio since we commenced operations  comprising of total loans at december  construction loans have decreased from of the portfolio at december  to of the portfolio at december  consumer loans generally have represented or less of the portfolio from december  to december  loans held for sale  which relates to our mortgage warehouse operations and are principally mortgage loans being warehoused for sale typically within days  fluctuate based on the level of market demand in the product 
due to recent market conditions experienced in the mortgage industry  some loans have not been sold within the normal timeframe 
as a result  we have transferred some loans to the loans held for investment portfolio 
loans are transferred at a lower of cost or market basis 
we originate substantially all of the loans held in our portfolio  except select loan participations and syndications  which are underwritten independently by us prior to purchase  and certain usda and sba government guaranteed loans that we purchase in the secondary market 

table of contents the following summarizes our loan portfolios by major category as of the dates indicated december in thousands commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases loans held for sale total we continue to lend primarily in texas 
as of december   a substantial majority of the principal amount of the loans in our portfolio was to businesses and individuals in texas 
this geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions in texas 
within the loan portfolio  loans to the services industry were billion  or  of total loans at december  other notable concentrations include million in personal household loans which includes loans to certain high net worth individuals for commercial purposes and mortgage loans held for sale  in addition to consumer loans  million to the contracting construction and real estate development industry  million in petrochemical and mining loans and million in investors and investment management company loans 
the risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date 
loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity on december  remaining maturities of selected loans in thousands total within year years after years loan maturity commercial construction total interest rate sensitivity for selected loans with predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total summary of loan loss experience the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level consistent with management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends 
we recorded a provision of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and no provision for the reserve for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves for impaired loans and an estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified with specified loans 
we regularly evaluate our reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb estimated loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors contributing to the determination of reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral  and general economic conditions 
all loan commitments 
table of contents rated substandard or worse and greater than  are specifically reviewed for impairment 
for loans deemed to be impaired  a specific allocation is assigned based on the losses expected to be realized from those loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
credit grades are assigned to all loans greater than  each credit grade is assigned a risk factor  or reserve allocation percentage 
these risk factors are multiplied by the outstanding principal balance and risk weighted by product type to calculate the required reserve 
a similar process is employed to calculate that portion of the required reserve assigned to unfunded loan commitments 
even though portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the reserve allocation percentages assigned to each credit grade have been developed based primarily on an analysis of our historical loss rates  and historical loss rates at selected peer banks  adjusted for certain qualitative factors 
qualitative adjustments for such things as general economic conditions  changes in credit policies and lending standards  and changes in the trend and severity of problem loans  can cause the estimation of future losses to differ from past experience 
in addition  the reserve considers the results of reviews performed by independent third party reviewers as reflected in their confirmations of assigned credit grades within the portfolio 
the portion of the allowance that is not derived by the allowance allocation percentages compensates for the uncertainty and complexity in estimating loan and lease losses including factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination and application of the allowance allocation percentages 
we evaluate many factors and conditions in determining the unallocated portion of the allowance  including the economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends and general growth in the portfolio 
the allowance is considered adequate and appropriate  given management s assessment of potential losses within the portfolio as of the evaluation date  the significant growth in the loan and lease portfolio  current economic conditions in the company s market areas and other factors 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and anticipated future credit losses 
the changes are reflected in the general reserve and in specific reserves as the collectibility of larger classified loans is evaluated with new information 
as our portfolio has matured  historical loss ratios have been closely monitored  and our reserve adequacy relies primarily on our loss history 
currently  the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to our board of directors for their review  consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio  totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  the reserve percentage increased to at year end from and of loans held for investment at december  and  respectively 
at december   we believe the reserve is sufficient to cover all reasonably expected losses in the portfolio and has been derived from consistent application of the methodology described above

a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement 
reserves on impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
impaired loans  or a portion thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
securities portfolio securities are identified as either held to maturity or available for sale based upon various factors  including asset liability management strategies  liquidity and profitability objectives  and regulatory requirements 
held to maturity securities are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts

we regularly evaluate all of our various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility  stability  reliability and cost effectiveness 
for the years ended december  and  our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits  supplemented by our short term and long term borrowings  primarily from securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased from our downstream correspondent bank relationships which consist of banks that are considered to be smaller than our bank and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings

critical accounting policies sec guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the more significant of these policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all these significant accounting policies require management to 
table of contents make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
however  the policies noted below could be deemed to meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies 
management considers the policies related to the allowance for loan losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation 
the total allowance for loan losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain classified loans and general reserves 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  and more specifically  changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and or in the value of pledged collateral 
a reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types in order to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
see summary of loan loss experience for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
new accounting standards see note new accounting standards in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
additionally  the financial instruments subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading purposes or held for other than trading 
we are subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on our portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading 
the effect of other changes  such as foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to us 
the responsibility for managing market risk rests with the balance sheet management committee bsmc  which operates under policy guidelines established by our board of directors 
the negative acceptable variation in net interest revenue due to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates is generally limited by these guidelines to 
these guidelines also establish maximum levels for short term borrowings  short term assets and public and brokered deposits 
they also establish minimum levels for unpledged assets  among other things 
compliance with these guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the bsmc  with exceptions reported to our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
interest rate risk management our interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions as of december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive  where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

the table above sets forth the balances as of december  for interest bearing assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the total of non interest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
while a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from demand deposits and stockholders equity 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income 
we quantify and measure interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates and account balances over the next twelve months based on three interest rate scenarios 
these are a most likely rate scenario and two shock test scenarios 
the most likely rate scenario is based on the consensus forecast of future interest rates published by independent sources 
these forecasts incorporate future spot rates and relevant spreads of instruments that are actively traded in the open market 
the federal reserve s federal funds target affects short term borrowing  the prime lending rate and the libor are the basis for most of our variable rate loan pricing 
the year mortgage rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage backed 
table of contents securities 
these are our primary interest rate exposures 
we are currently not using derivatives to manage our interest rate exposure 
the two shock test scenarios assume a sustained parallel basis point increase or decrease  respectively  in interest rates 
our interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminable maturity deposits demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage backed securities  residential and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
the impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
this modeling indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows anticipated impact over the next twelve months as compared to most likely scenario bp increase bp decrease bp increase bp decrease in thousands december  december  december  december  change in net interest income the simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics  future cash flows and customer behavior 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors
