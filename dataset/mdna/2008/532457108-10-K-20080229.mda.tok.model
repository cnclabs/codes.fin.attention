item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition review of operations executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  significant business development  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  and legal  regulatory  and other matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent 
this growth was primarily driven by volume increases in a number of key products  with a significant portion of this increase in volume resulting from the acquisition of icos 
our additional investments in marketing and selling expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care products  contributed to this sales growth and enabled us to increase our investment in research and development percent in while cost of sales and operating expenses in the aggregate grew at approximately the same rate as sales  other income net decreased and the effective tax rate increased 
as a result  net income and earnings per share increased percent  to billion  or per share  in as compared with billion  or per share  in net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we recognized asset impairments  restructuring  and other special charges of million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by

chart late stage pipeline developments and business development activity our long term success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we have achieved a number of successes with late stage pipeline developments and recent business development transactions within the past year  including pipeline on december   together with our collaboration partner daiichi sankyo company  limited  we submitted a new drug application nda for prasugrel to the us food and drug administration fda 
the proposed trademark for prasugrel is effient tm 
the submission follows the release of results of the triton timi phase iii head to head study of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in november 
in january  the fda approved cialis for once daily use to treat erectile dysfunction 
cialis was approved by the european commission for once daily use in june in november  the fda approved cymbalta for the maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults 
in february  the fda approved cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder 
during  we submitted a supplemental new drug application to the fda for cymbalta for the management of fibromyalgia 
in october  with our collaboration partners amylin pharmaceuticals  inc  and alkermes  inc  we announced positive results from a week comparator study of once weekly exenatide long acting release injection and byetta exenatide injection taken twice daily in patients with type diabetes 
in the second quarter  we submitted ndas to the fda and the european medicines agency emea for approval of olanzapine zyprexa long acting injection 
in late february  the fda issued a not approvable letter  stating it needs more information to better understand the risk and underlying cause of excessive sedation events that have been observed in about one percent of patients in clinical trials 
in september  the fda approved evista for a new use to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in two populations postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer 
we submitted an application to the emea for centralized review of alimta  in combination with cisplatin  for the first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer 
business development in december  we entered into a licensing and development agreement with bioms medical corp 
whereby we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a multiple sclerosis ms compound 
the compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal phase iii clinical trials in secondary progressive ms spms and one phase ii clinical trial in relapsing remitting ms rrms 
in connection with this agreement  we will incur a charge to earnings for acquired ipr d of million pretax  which will be included as expense in the first quarter of in october  we entered into an agreement with glenmark pharmaceuticals limited india whereby we acquired the rights to a portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid sub family trpv antagonist molecules  including a clinical phase compound 
the compound is currently in phase ii development as a potential next generation treatment for various pain conditions  including osteoarthritic pain 
in october  we entered into a global strategic alliance with macrogenics  inc  to develop and commercialize teplizumab  a humanized anti cd monoclonal antibody  as well as other potential next generation anti cd molecules for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases 
as part of the arrangement  we acquired the exclusive rights to the molecule 
teplizumab is currently being studied in the prot g trial  a global pivotal phase ii iii clinical trial for individuals with recent onset type diabetes 
in june  we completed the acquisition of ivy animal health  inc  a privately held applied research and pharmaceutical product development company focused on the animal health industry 
the acquisition provides us with product lines that complement those of our animal health business 
in april  we completed the acquisition of hypnion  inc  a privately held neuroscience drug discovery company focused on sleep disorders 
the deal expands our presence in the area of sleep disorder research and provides ownership of a novel phase ii insomnia compound with a dual mechanism of action aimed at promoting better sleep onset and sleep maintenance 
in january  we completed the acquisition of icos at a cost of approximately billion 
the acquisition brings the full value of cialis to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development  marketing  and selling of this product 
in january  we licensed from osi pharmaceuticals its glucokinase activator gka program for the treatment of type diabetes  including the lead compound 
lilly received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the gka program 
legal  regulatory  and other matters in october  the united states supreme court denied the petitions for certiorari that were filed by teva pharmaceuticals and dr 
reddy s laboratories  bringing to an end the two companies challenges to the validity of lilly s us zyprexa patent 
in june  we received notice of two court rulings by the canadian federal court and the german patent court that permit the entry of generic olanzapine zyprexa by competitors into the canadian and german markets 
generic olanzapine is now available for sale by competitors in canada and germany 
we have reached agreements with claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately  claims against us relating to the medication 
approximately  claims remain 
as a result of our product liability exposures  since the beginning of  we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of billion for zyprexa product liability matters 
in march  we were notified by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa that it had commenced an investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices for zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly tm 
in november  we received a grand jury subpoena from the edpa requesting documents related to zyprexa 
in the united states  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma continues to effectively provide a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program known as medicare part d 
various measures have been discussed and or passed in both the us house of representatives and us senate that would impose additional pricing pressures on our products  including proposals to legalize the importation of prescription drugs and either allow  or require  the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
additionally  various proposals have been introduced that would increase the rebates we pay on sales to medicaid patients 
we expect pricing pressures at the federal and state levels to continue 
in  the centers for medicare and medicaid services released a final rule seeking to implement sections of the deficit reduction act of this rule relates to the medicaid program and among other things  sets out a methodology for the calculation and use of average manufacturer price and best price for pharmaceuticals 
we have implemented the final rule  which has the effect of reducing net selling prices for medicaid sales  however  we do not expect the impact to be material to our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  or financial position 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
operating results sales our worldwide sales for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by the inclusion of cialis since our january  acquisition of icos and sales growth of cymbalta  zyprexa  alimta  gemzar  and humalog

our revenues increased percent to million in animal health product sales in the us increased percent  driven by increased demand  the acquisition of ivy animal health  and new companion animal product launches 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and increased demand 
chart gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin decreased to percent of sales compared with percent for this decrease was primarily due to the expense resulting from the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the icos acquisition  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  and production volumes growing at a slower rate than sales  offset partially by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales 
operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion 
in addition to the acquisition of icos  this increase was due to increases in discovery research and late stage clinical trial costs 
we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately percent of our sales into research and development during marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion 
this increase was largely due to the impact of the icos acquisition  as well as increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care products  and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
acquired ipr d charges were million in and related to the acquisitions of icos  hypnion  and ivy  as well as our licensing arrangements with osi  macrogenics  and glenmark

other income net decreased million  to million 
this line item consists of interest expense  interest income  the after tax operating results of the lilly icos joint venture  and all other miscellaneous income and expense items 
interest expense for decreased million  to million 
this decrease is a result of lower average debt balances in compared to interest income for decreased million  to million  due to lower cash balances in compared to the lilly icos joint venture income was million in as compared to million in  due to the acquisition of icos on january  net other miscellaneous income items increased million to million 
we incurred tax expense of million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent  compared with percent for the effective tax rates for and were affected primarily by the nondeductible icos and hypnion ipr d charges of million in  and the product liability charges of million in the tax effect of the product liability charge was less than our effective tax rate  as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
chart operating results financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products 
we increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care products  and continued our commitment to research and development  investing approximately percent of our sales during our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the lilly icos joint venture as well as cost containment and productivity initiatives 
net income was billion  or per share  in as compared with billion  or per share  in  representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of percent 
certain items  reflected in our operating results for and  should be considered in comparing the two years

worldwide sales volume increased percent  and selling prices increased sales by percent 
foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth 
sales in the us increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta  diabetes care products  forteo  and zyprexa 
us growth comparisons benefited from an estimated million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in the first quarter of additionally  we experienced a sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low income patients from medicaid to medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our lillyanswers program following the implementation of mma in this contributed part of the increases in us net effective sales prices of percent 
sales outside the us increased percent  to billion  driven by growth of cymbalta  alimta  and zyprexa 
zyprexa sales in the us increased percent in  driven by higher prices  offset in part by lower demand 
the increase in net selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low income patients from medicaid to medicare

results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows humalog sales increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices  and increased percent outside the us  due primarily to increased volume  offset partially by lower prices 
humulin sales in the us decreased percent due primarily to decreased volume  offset partially by increased selling prices 
outside the us  humulin sales decreased percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices 
actos revenues in the us decreased percent in  due to the expiration of our us marketing rights in september sales outside the us increased percent  due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  offset in part by lower prices 
total sales of byetta  launched in the us in june  were million for sales of gemzar increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in gemzar sales increased percent outside the us  driven by strong volume

sales outside the us decreased percent  driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of surmax as a result of the european union s growth promotion use ban on the product  effective january  gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin increased to percent of sales compared with percent for this increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume  partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs 
we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately percent of our sales into research and development during marketing  selling  and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion 
this increase was largely attributable to increased marketing and selling expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise  and an increase in litigation related costs 
other income net decreased million  to million 
interest expense for increased million  to million 
this increase was a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late of certain manufacturing facilities

the tax benefit associated with these charges was less than our effective tax rate  as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  cash flow from operations in of billion and net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of billion exceeded the total of the net cash paid for corporate acquisitions of billion  dividends paid of billion  and purchases of property and equipment of billion 
capital expenditures of billion during were consistent with  due primarily to the management of capital spending 
we expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives  continue to upgrade our manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems  and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products 
chart total debt as of december  increased billion  to billion  reflecting the billion of debt we issued in to finance our acquisition of icos  offset by long term debt repayment of billion 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain at aa and aa  respectively 
dividends of per share were paid in  an increase of percent from in the fourth quarter of  effective for the first quarter dividend in  the quarterly dividend was increased to 
per share a percent increase  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
the year was the rd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  costs associated with product liability litigation  dividends  and taxes in we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short term borrowings  if necessary 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program 
our access to credit markets has not been adversely affected by the recent illiquidity in the market 
various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
chart in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen  and the british pound against the euro 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire and partner assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur  as the failure rate for products in development is very high 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of billion are excluded as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
for more than percent of our sales  this is at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
the remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery 
provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early  reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera  prozac  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately million 
the modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns  which have been approximately percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales 
sales rebates discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  patient assistance programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate discount contracts 
the largest of our sales rebate discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate discount contracts 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our medicaid and medicare rebate liability was million 
approximately percent and percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions rebate and discount liability  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates rebate and discount liability  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial position of the insurers  and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
periodically  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent to percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease would lower the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by approximately million 
if the discount rate for the us defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if the expected return on plan assets for us plans were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for us plans were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately million 
the us plans represent approximately percent of the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and approximately percent of total plan assets at december  impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately million and million  respectively 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this guidance includes the anticipated acquired in process research and development charges of 
related to the bioms in licensing agreement 
we expect sales to grow in the mid to high single digits  driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for cymbalta  cialis  byetta  alimta  and humalog 
we expect modest improvement in gross margin as a percent of net sales  driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing more slowly than sales 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to grow more slowly than sales in  with growth in the mid single digits 
marketing  selling  and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the low single digits  driven by investments in prasugrel  cymbalta  evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction  humalog  and byetta  offset by decreases in other areas 
research and development expenses are expected to grow in the high single to low double digits 
other income net is expected to contribute less than million 
the effective tax rate is expected to be approximately percent 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately billion 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges  foreign exchange rates  changes in effective tax rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  and government investigations  and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
while it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matters  we believe that  except as specifically noted below  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period

we have received challenges to zyprexa patents in a number of countries outside the us in canada  several generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patent expiring in 
in april  the canadian federal court ruled against the first challenger  apotex inc apotex  and apotex has appealed that ruling 
in june  the canadian federal court held that the invalidity allegations of a second challenger  novopharm ltd 
novopharm  were justified and denied our request that novopharm be prohibited from receiving marketing approval for generic olanzapine in canada 
novopharm began selling generic olanzapine in canada in the third quarter of we have appealed that decision and sued novopharm for patent infringement 
the appeal was dismissed 
in november  apotex filed an action seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patents expiring in 
the trial court ruled in our favor in february apotex will likely appeal 
in germany  generic pharmaceutical manufacturers egis gyogyszergyar and neolabs ltd 
challenged the validity of our zyprexa compound and method of use patents expiring in 
in june  the german federal patent court held that our patent is invalid 
we are appealing the decision 
generic olanzapine was launched by competitors in germany in the fourth quarter of we have received challenges in a number of other countries  including spain  the united kingdom uk  and several smaller european countries 
in spain  we have been successful at both the trial and appellate court levels in defeating the generic manufacturers challenge  but we anticipate further legal challenges from generic manufacturers 
in the uk  a trial date has tentatively been set for july we are vigorously contesting the various legal challenges to our zyprexa patents on a country by country basis 
we cannot determine the outcome of this litigation 
the availability of generic olanzapine in canada and germany will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the availability of generic olanzapine in additional markets could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in june  ariad pharmaceuticals  inc  the massachusetts institute of technology  the whitehead institute for biomedical research  and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts sued us  alleging that sales of two of our products  xigris and evista  were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body  and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products 
on may   a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent 
the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately million in damages  calculated by applying a percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial 
in addition  a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held in august  on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes 
in june  the united states patent and trademark office uspto commenced a reexamination of the patent  and in august took the position that the ariad claims at issue are unpatentable  a position that ariad continues to contest 
in september  the court entered a final judgment indicating that ariad s claims are patentable  valid  and enforceable  and finding damages in the amount of million plus a percent royalty on net us sales of xigris and evista since the time of the jury decision 
however  the court deferred the requirement to pay any damages until after all rights to appeal have been exhausted 
we plan to appeal this judgment 
we believe that these allegations are without legal merit  that we will ultimately prevail on these issues  and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 
government investigations and related litigation in march  the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania edpa advised us that it had commenced an investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices  including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors  with respect to zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly 
in november  we received a grand jury subpoena from the edpa for a broad range of documents related to zyprexa 
a number of state medicaid fraud control units are coordinating with the edpa in its investigation of any medicaid related claims relating to our marketing and promotion of zyprexa 
in october  the edpa advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid  evista  humalog  humulin  prozac  and zyprexa 
the inquiry includes a review of our medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements 
in june  we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general  medicaid fraud control unit  of the state of florida  seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
in september  we received a subpoena from the california attorney general s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa s status on california s formulary  marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa  and remuneration of health care providers 
in february  we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of illinois  seeking production of documents and information relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices  including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors  with respect to zyprexa 
beginning in august  we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states under various state consumer protection laws 
most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general 
we are aware that approximately states are participating in this joint effort  and it is possible that additional states will join the investigation 
these attorneys general are seeking a broad range of zyprexa documents  including documents relating to sales  marketing and promotional practices  and remuneration of health care providers 
in addition  we have been named as a defendant in a private suit in california state court  which was removed to federal court  alleging violations of the california false claims act with respect to certain zyprexa marketing and promotional practices 
this suit was brought by an individual on behalf of the government  under the qui tam provision of the california false claims act 
we are cooperating in each of these investigations  including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations 
it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines  penalties  or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies 
we cannot determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome 
it is possible  however  that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices  physician communications  remuneration of health care professionals  managed care arrangements  and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 
product liability and related litigation we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 

since june  we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims 
the agreements cover a total of approximately  claimants  including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims 
the two primary settlements were as follows in june  we reached an agreement in principle and in september a final agreement to settle more than  claims for million plus million to cover administration of the settlement 
in january  we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than  claims for approximately million 
the settlement totaling million was paid during the january settlements were paid during we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining claims 
the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately lawsuits in the us covering approximately  plaintiffs 
trial dates have been set for june   in the eastern district of new york  for several of the us plaintiffs 
in early  we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa 
one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec  and a second has been certified in ontario and includes all canadian residents  except for residents of quebec and british columbia 
the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us we have insurance coverage for a portion of our zyprexa product liability claims exposure 
the third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies 
the dispute was the subject of litigation in the federal court in indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in bermuda against other carriers 
in the second half of  we reached settlements resolving the vast majority of the disputed insurance claims  and a portion of the insurance proceeds were paid to us prior to the end of since the beginning of  we have recorded aggregate net pretax charges of billion for zyprexa product liability matters 
the net charges  which take into account our actual and expected insurance recoveries  covered the following the cost of the zyprexa product liability settlements to date  and reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the known zyprexa product liability claims and expected future claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims 
in december  we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals  alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york 
in these actions  the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
we have been served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska  mississippi  montana  new mexico  pennsylvania  south carolina  utah  and west virginia in the courts of the respective states 
the mississippi  montana  new mexico  and west virginia cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york 
the alaska case is scheduled for trial beginning march  in  two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit  which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
two additional lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york in on similar grounds 
in  the pennsylvania employees trust fund brought claims in state court in pennsylvania as insurer of pennsylvania state employees  who were prescribed zyprexa on similar grounds as described in the new york cases 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
we cannot determine with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted 
the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
in addition  we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal 
the majority of these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past few years  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  as noted above  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims
