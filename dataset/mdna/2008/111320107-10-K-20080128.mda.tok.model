cable modems unlike traditional dial up modems that provide online access through the telephone system  cable modems provide users high speed internet access through a cable television network 
although cable networks were originally established to deliver television programming to subscribers homes  cable television operators have generally upgraded their systems to support two way communications  high speed internet access and telecommuting through the use of cable modems 
these modems are designed to achieve downstream transmission speeds of up to megabits per second  or mbps north american standard  or mbps international standard  and upstream transmission to the network at speeds of up to mbps 
the speeds achieved by cable modems are nearly  times faster than the fastest analog telephone modems  which transmit downstream at up to kilobits per second  or kbps  and upstream at up to kbps 
cable modems typically connect to a user s pc through a standard base t ethernet card or universal serial bus  also known as a usb  connection 
a device called a cable modem termination system  or cmts  located at a local cable provider s network hub  communicates through television channels to cable modems in subscribers homes and controls access to cable modems on the network 
the cable industry s adoption of an open standard  the data over cable service interface specification  commonly known as docsis  has made possible interoperability among various manufacturers cable modems and cmts equipment used by different cable networks 
the first specification  docsis  was adopted in and enabled the cost effective deployment of cable modems 
in the docsis specification  which enhanced docsis to include support for cable telephony using voip technology  streaming video and managed data services  was announced 
in docsis was announced and adds support for higher upstream transmission speeds of up to mbps and more symmetric ip services  and provides extra capacity for cable telephony 
in the docsis specification was announced and provides enhanced data rates and security and is backwards compatible with prior standards 
the high speeds of today s cable modems can enable an entirely new generation of multimedia rich content over the internet and allow cable operators to expand their traditional video product offerings to include data and telephone services 
the adoption of cable modem services and the continued proliferation of homes with multiple pcs have also generated the need for residential networking 
cable television operators have recognized the opportunity to include this feature in the equipment they utilize for cable modem services through either home telephone line or wireless solutions  and the cable industry has created a specification called cablehome tm that defines how a home intranet interoperates with a cable provider s internet service

digital cable  direct broadcast satellite and ip set top boxes and digital television the last decade has seen rapid growth in the quantity and diversity of television programming 
despite ongoing efforts to upgrade the existing cable infrastructure  an inadequate number of channels exists to provide the content demanded by consumers 
in an effort to increase the number of channels and provide higher picture quality  cable service providers began offering digital programming in through the use of new digital cable set top boxes  or stbs 
these digital cable stbs facilitate high speed digital communications between a subscriber s television and the cable network 
digital cable set top boxes are currently able to support downstream transmission speeds to the subscriber up to mbps north american standard or mbps international standard  as well as several hundred mpeg or mpeg advanced video coding compressed digital television channels 
direct broadcast satellite  or dbs  is the primary alternative to cable for providing digital television programming 
dbs broadcasts video and audio data from satellites directly to digital stbs in the home via dish antennas 
due to the ability of dbs to provide television programming where no cable infrastructure is in place  we believe that the global market for dbs set top boxes will outpace the market for cable set top boxes 
the federal communications commission has stated that traditional terrestrial broadcast stations will be required to broadcast in digital format 
currently  the fcc is targeting for this mandated digital conversion that will ultimately require all television sets that are inches or larger  dvd players and video cassette recorders to incorporate an hdtv receiver

table of contents high definition dvd players the dvd player market is currently undergoing a transition as a result of the increased adoption of hdtv sets by consumers and the advent of advanced video compression technologies  such as h 
also known as mpeg part advanced video coding  or avc and vc smpte m  the smpte standard based on microsoft windows media video these trends have led television broadcasters and movie studios to begin offering more high definition video content 
in turn  consumer electronics manufacturers have begun offering high definition dvd players and recorders  with substantially greater storage capacity and the ability to effectively handle the significantly higher bit rates associated with high resolution hdtv content 
however  similar to the battle between vhs versus betamax in the s and s  two competing optical disc formats have emerged the blu ray disc and hd dvd formats 
both blu ray disc and hd dvd disc formats offer significantly greater storage capacity than the current dvd standard  but they differ in the depth of the recording layer inside the disc  like a standard dvd  the recoding layer in an hd dvd is midway through the disc  while in a blu ray disc it can be found much closer to the surface 
this difference makes the two formats incompatible 
broadcom entered the high definition dvd player market through our acquisition of sand video  a developer of advanced video compression technology  in april our initial product for this market is a high definition video decoder audio processor chip that is fully compliant with both the blu ray disc and hd dvd disc formats

table of contents local area networking local area networks  or lans  consist of various types of equipment  such as servers  workstations and desktop and notebook computers  interconnected by copper  fiber or coaxial cables utilizing a common networking protocol  generally the ethernet protocol 
ethernet scales in speed from mbps to gigabits per second  or gbps  providing both the bandwidth and scalability required in today s dynamic networking environment 
as the volume and complexity of network traffic continues to increase  communications bottlenecks have developed in corporate lans 
as a result  technologies such as gigabit ethernet  a networking standard that supports data transfer rates of up to one gbps  and the gigabit ethernet standard  which supports data transfer rates of up to gbps  are replacing older technologies such as fast ethernet  which supports data transfer rates of up to mbps  and base t ethernet  which supports data transfer rates of mbps 
gigabit ethernet has emerged as the predominant networking technology for desktop and notebook computers  and we expect server and backbone connections to continue to migrate to the newer gigabit ethernet standard 
we further expect the continued use of switch connections in place of legacy repeater connections 
switches not only have the ability to provide dedicated bandwidth to each connection  but also provide routing functionality and possess the capability to deal with differentiated traffic such as voice  video and data 
as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the installed base of base t ethernet switches as well as network interface cards  or nics  will be upgraded to faster technologies 
we have a complete line of fast ethernet  gigabit ethernet and gigabit ethernet transceivers  controllers and switches that are highly integrated  low power soc solutions for servers  workstations  desktop and notebook computers  voip phones and wireless access points that enable the high speed transmission of voice  video and data services over the category unshielded twisted pair copper wiring widely deployed in enterprise and small office networks

these reference platforms generally include an extensive suite of software drivers as well as protocol and application layer software to assist our customers in developing their own end products 
by providing these reference platforms  we assist our customers in achieving easier and faster transitions from initial prototype designs to final production releases 
these reference platforms also enhance the customer s confidence that our products will meet its market requirements and product introduction schedules 
customers and strategic relationships we sell our products to leading manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment in each of our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several markets 
customers currently shipping wired and wireless communications equipment incorporating our products include alcatel  apple  cisco  dell  echostar  hewlett packard  ibm  lg  motorola  netgear  nintendo  nokia  nortel networks  pace  samsung  and thomson ce  among others 
to meet the current and future technical needs in our target markets  we have also established strategic relationships with multiservice operators that provide wired and wireless communications services to consumers and businesses 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenue 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel  change or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
core technologies using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  we design  develop and supply complete soc solutions and system level software  together with related hardware and software applications for our target markets 
our proven soc design methodology has enabled us to be first to market with advanced chips that are highly integrated and cost effective  and that facilitate the easy integration of our customers intellectual property 
our design methodology leverages industry standard  state of the art electronic design automation tools  and generally migrates easily to new silicon processes and technology platforms 
it also allows for the easy integration of acquired or licensed technology  providing customers with a broad range of silicon options with differentiated networking and performance features 
we believe our key competitive advantages include superior engineering execution and our broad base of core technologies encompassing the complete design space from systems to silicon 
we have developed and continue to build on the following technology foundations proprietary communications systems algorithms and protocols  advanced dsp hardware architectures  soc design methodologies and advanced library development for both standard cell and full custom integrated circuit design  
table of contents high performance radio frequency  analog and mixed signal circuit design using industry standard cmos processes  high performance custom microprocessor architectures and circuit designs  and extensive software reference platforms and board level hardware reference platforms to enable complete system level solutions 
research and development we have assembled a large team of experienced engineers and technologists  many of whom are leaders in their particular field or discipline 
as of december  we had  research and development employees  the majority of whom hold advanced degrees  including employees with ph 
ds 
these key employees are involved in advancing our core technologies  as well as applying them to our product development activities 
because the soc solutions for many of our target markets benefit from the same underlying core technologies  we are able to address a wide range of wired and wireless communications markets with a relatively focused investment in research and development 
we believe that the achievement of higher levels of integration and the timely introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth 
our current plans are to maintain our significant research and development staffing levels in and for the foreseeable future 
in addition to our principal design facilities in irvine  california and santa clara county  california  we have design centers in tempe  arizona  san diego county  california  colorado springs  fort collins and longmont  colorado  duluth  georgia  germantown  maryland  andover  massachusetts  bloomington  minnesota  matawan and glen rock  new jersey  morrisville  north carolina  lancaster  pennsylvania  austin  texas and seattle  washington  among other locations 
internationally  we have design facilities in belgium  canada  china  denmark  france  greece  india  israel  japan  korea  the netherlands  singapore  taiwan and the united kingdom  among other locations 
we anticipate establishing additional design centers in the united states and in other countries 
our research and development expense was billion  billion and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts included stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
manufacturing wafer fabrication most of our products are manufactured using standard cmos process techniques 
the standard nature of these processes permits us to engage independent silicon foundries to fabricate our integrated circuits 
by subcontracting our manufacturing requirements  we are able to focus our resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater competitive advantages 
this strategy also eliminates the high cost of owning and operating semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities 
our operations and quality engineering teams closely manage the interface between manufacturing and design engineering 
while our design methodology typically creates a smaller than average die for a given function  it also generates full custom integrated circuit designs 
as a result  we are responsible for the complete functional and parametric performance testing of our devices  including quality 
we employ a fully staffed operations and quality organization similar to that of a vertically integrated semiconductor manufacturer 
we also arrange with our foundries to have online work in progress control 
our approach makes the manufacturing subcontracting process transparent to our customers 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors located in asia to manufacture substantially all of our products 
our key silicon foundries are taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation in taiwan  chartered semiconductor manufacturing in singapore  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation in china  silterra malaysia sdn 
bhd 
in malaysia and united microelectronics corporation in singapore and taiwan  several of which maintain multiple fabrication facilities in various locations 
limitation of any of our five independent foundry subcontractors to provide the necessary capacity or output for our products could result in significant 
table of contents production delays and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we currently believe we have adequate capacity to support our current sales levels  we continue to work with our existing foundries to obtain more production capacity  and we intend to qualify new foundries to provide additional production capacity 
it is possible that from time to time adequate foundry capacity may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event a foundry experiences financial difficulties  or if a foundry suffers any damage to or destruction of its facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
our products are currently fabricated with 
micron  quad layer metal  
micron  five layer metal  
micron  five and six layer metal  
micron  six and seven layer metal  nanometer  six and seven layer metal structures  and nanometer  six and seven layer metal structures 
we continuously evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies  and are designing most new products in nanometer process technology  seven to eight layer metal  feature sizes 
although our experience to date with the migration of products to smaller processes geometries has been predominantly favorable  the transition to nanometer geometry process technology has resulted in significantly higher mask and prototyping costs  as well as additional expenditures for engineering design tools and related computer hardware 
we may face similar expenses and difficulties or delays as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
other companies in our industry have experienced difficulty transitioning to new manufacturing processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields or delays in product deliveries 
we believe that the transition of our products to smaller geometries will be important for us to remain competitive 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
assembly and test our wafer probe testing is conducted by either our independent foundries or independent wafer probe test subcontractors 
following completion of the wafer probe tests  the die are assembled into packages and the finished products are tested by one of our eight key subcontractors advanced semiconductor engineering in china and taiwan  amkor in korea  philippines and china  asat in hong kong  eems test singapore in singapore  signetics in korea  siliconware precision in taiwan  stats chippac in singapore  korea  malaysia and china  and united test and assembly center in singapore 
while we have not experienced material disruptions in supply from assembly subcontractors to date  we and others in our industry have experienced shortages in the supply of packaging materials from time to time  and we could experience shortages or assembly problems in the future 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be materially and adversely affected in the event a subcontractor experiences financial difficulties  or if a subcontractor suffers any damage to or destruction of its facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
quality assurance manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment demand high quality and reliable semiconductors for incorporation into their products 
we focus on product reliability from the initial stage of the design cycle through each specific design process  including layout and production test design 
in addition  we subject our designs to in depth circuit simulation at temperature  voltage and processing extremes before initiating the manufacturing process 
we prequalify each assembly and foundry subcontractor 
this prequalification process consists of a series of industry standard environmental product stress tests  as well as an audit and analysis of the subcontractor s quality system and manufacturing capability 
we also participate in quality and reliability monitoring through each stage of the production cycle by reviewing electrical and parametric data from our wafer foundry and assembly subcontractors 
we closely monitor wafer foundry production to ensure consistent overall quality  reliability and yield levels 
in cases where we purchase wafers on a fixed price basis  any improvement in yields can reduce our cost per chip 

table of contents as part of our total quality program  we received iso certification  a comprehensive international standards organization specified quality system acknowledgement  for our singapore facility 
all of our principal independent foundries and package assembly facilities are currently iso certified 
while every effort is made to monitor and meet the quality requirements of our customers  including the use of industry standard procedures and other methods  it is possible that an unanticipated quality problem may result in interruptions or delays in product shipments 
in that event  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  and we may be required to apply significant capital and other resources to remedy any quality problem with our products 
environmental management we monitor the environmental impact of our products 
our manufacturing flow is registered to iso  the international standard related to environmental management  by our subcontractors 
due to environmental concerns  the need for lead free solutions in electronic components and systems is receiving increasing attention within the semiconductor industry and many companies are moving towards becoming compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive  or rohs  the european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances  including lead  effective july we believe that our products are compliant with the rohs directive 
however  it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages or delays may occur as a result of the application of iso  the rohs directive or other standards or regulations 
product distribution initially we distributed products to our customers through an operations and distribution center located in irvine  california 
in we established an international distribution center in singapore 
this facility put us closer to our suppliers and many key customers and improved our ability to meet customers needs 
our irvine facility continues to ship products to us destinations  while our singapore facility distributes products to international destinations 
net revenue derived from actual shipments to international destinations  primarily in asia including foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states  represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders in each of our targeted wired and wireless communications markets by providing quality  state of the art products  superior engineering execution  and superior sales  field application and engineering support 
we market and sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force  distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the majority of our sales occur through our direct sales force  which is based in offices located in california  colorado  florida  georgia  illinois  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new york  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  texas and virginia 
we have also engaged independent distributors  arrow electronics and avnet  inc  to service the north american and south american markets 
we market and sell our products internationally through regional offices located in canada  china  finland  france  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  singapore  spain  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom  among other locations  as well as through a network of independent distributors and representatives in australia  canada  germany  hong kong  india  israel  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan 
we select these independent entities based on their ability to provide effective field sales  marketing communications and technical support to our customers 
all international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
for information regarding revenue from independent customers by geographic area  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
we dedicate sales managers to principal customers to promote close cooperation and communication 
we also provide our customers with reference platform designs for most products 
we believe this enables our customers to achieve easier and faster transitions from the initial prototype designs through final production releases 
we believe these reference platform designs also significantly enhance customers confidence that our products will meet their market requirements and product introduction schedules 

table of contents backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products 
due to industry practice that allows customers to cancel  change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment  we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels 
competition wired and wireless communications markets and the semiconductor industry are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and price erosion 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for integrated circuit providers in our target markets include product quality  product capabilities  level of integration  engineering execution  reliability  price  time to market  market presence  standards compliance  system cost  intellectual property  customer interface and support  and reputation 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in our target markets 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and will continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers that choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties  and may refuse to provide us with information necessary to permit the interoperability of our products with theirs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features  lower power requirements or lower costs 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success and future revenue growth depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
however  these measures may not provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property 

table of contents we currently hold over  us and  foreign patents and have filed more than  additional us and foreign patent applications 
we may not receive any additional patents as a result of these applications or future applications 
even if additional patents are issued  any claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any existing or future patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any rights granted under such patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
the failure of any patents to adequately protect our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
in connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards  we may be required to license certain of our patents to other parties  including competitors  that develop products based upon the adopted industry standards 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and typically control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  to develop similar technology independently  or to design around our patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in certain foreign countries 
we have also entered into agreements with certain of our customers and granted these customers the right to use our proprietary technology in the event we default in our contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fail to cure the default within a specified time period 
in addition  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our designs  and therefore have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of their intellectual property 
it is possible that the steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or our customers intellectual property may not be successful 
moreover  we are currently engaged in litigation and may need to engage in additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
such litigation will result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  we have in the past and continue to be engaged in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
we may also be sued by parties who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
intellectual property claims and litigation may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or to redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology 
we may also have to indemnify certain customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
we have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them 
these indemnification provisions may  in some circumstances  extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and or lost profits 
even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted  the defense of these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources 
in any of these events  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  we have sought and may in the future seek to obtain licenses under other parties intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights to others in connection with cross license agreements or settlements of claims or actions asserted against us 
however  we may not be able to obtain licenses under another s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents employees as of december  we had  full time  contract and temporary employees  including  individuals engaged in research and development  engaged in sales and marketing  engaged in manufacturing operations  and engaged in finance  legal and general administrative activities 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage

risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere  and the other information contained  in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock will likely decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results  the market price of our class a common stock will likely decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section the overall cyclicality of  and changing economic  political and market conditions affecting the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets  including without limitation seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  the gain or loss of a key customer  design win or order  our ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or demand for new products requested by our customers  our dependence on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards and to identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets  intellectual property disputes  customer indemnification claims and other types of litigation risks  our ability to timely and effectively transition to smaller geometry process technologies or achieve higher levels of design integration  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers  with the experience and capabilities  and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets  changes in our product or customer mix  the availability and pricing of third party semiconductor foundry  assembly and test capacity and raw materials  competitive pressures and other factors such as the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  
table of contents the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  and the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  terrorist activities  international conflicts and other events beyond our control 
we expect new product lines to continue to account for a high percentage of our future sales 
some of these markets are immature and or unpredictable or are new markets for broadcom  and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop into significant opportunities or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets 
based on the limited amount of historical data available to us  it is difficult to anticipate our future revenue streams from  or the sustainability of  such newer markets 
typically our new products have lower gross margins until we commence volume production and launch lower cost revisions of such products  enabling us to benefit from economies of scale and more efficient designs 
additionally  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  such as desktop and notebook computers  cellular phones and other mobile communication devices  other wireless enabled consumer electronics  and satellite and digital cable set top boxes  we anticipate greater seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our products  which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results 
we have recently entered into arrangements that include multiple deliverables  such as the sale of semiconductor products and related data services 
under these arrangements  the services may be provided without having a separate fair value under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf in that event  we will only recognize a portion of the total revenue we receive from the customer during a quarter  and will recognize the remaining revenue on a ratable basis over the expected life of the service being provided 
there are also other scenarios under eitf whereby revenue may be deferred for even longer periods or ratable recognition over the service period may not be permitted and all of the revenue may be required to be recognized in later periods or at the end of the arrangement 
as we enter into future multiple element arrangements in which the fair value of each deliverable is not known  the portion of revenue we recognize on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  which could cause even greater fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the cyclical nature of and volatility in the semiconductor industry 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock may decline 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories  and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue and in our results of operations 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of the industry or wired and wireless communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
accordingly  our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause large fluctuations in our stock price 
additionally  in the recent past  general worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  increased energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the wired and wireless communications markets  the ongoing effects of the war in iraq  recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity  and the impact of natural disasters and public health emergencies 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
we experienced slowdowns in orders in the second half of and in the fourth quarter of that we believe were attributable in substantial part to excess inventory held by certain of our customers  and we may experience a similar slowdown in the future 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery  worldwide  or in the 
table of contents semiconductor industry or the wired and wireless communications markets 
if the economy or markets in which we operate do not continue at their present levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by our lengthy sales cycle 
if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margin 
conversely  we may have insufficient inventory  which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel  change or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
in the recent past  some of our customers have developed excess inventories of their own products and have  as a consequence  deferred purchase orders for our products 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products  are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and may be involved in legal proceedings that could affect their ability to buy our products 
our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may also be impaired by the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to more than nine months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than twelve months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurance that the customer will ultimately bring its product to market or that such effort by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or curtail  reduce or delay its product plans 
if we incur significant research and development expenses  marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  as an increasing number of our chips are being incorporated into consumer products  we anticipate greater fluctuations in demand for our products  which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand 
we place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and  in some instances  may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to  if at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  our revenue and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements  we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
historically we have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely 
table of contents affected 
in addition  distributors and or customers with hubbing arrangements provide us periodic reports regarding the product  price  quantity  and when products are shipped to their customer as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
for specialized shipping terms we may also rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers 
for our royalty revenue we also rely on data provided by our customers 
any error in the data provided to us by customers  distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  gross profit and net income 
additionally  since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory turns to decrease  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flow 
if we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to expand 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce from  full time  contract and temporary employees as of december  to  full time  contract and temporary employees as of december  nonetheless  we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products and services or to the demand for new products requested by our customers 
in that event  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
conversely  if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products  and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we expect new product lines  which often require substantial research and development expenses to develop  to continue to account for a high percentage of our future revenue 
however  some of the markets for these new products are immature and or unpredictable or are new markets for broadcom  and if these markets do not develop at the rates we originally anticipated  the rate of increase in our operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase  if any  in our revenue 
moreover  we may intentionally choose to increase the rate of our research and development expenses more rapidly than the increase in the rate of our revenue in the short term in anticipation of the longer term benefits we would derive from such investment 
however  such benefits may never materialize or may not be as significant as we originally believed they would be 
also  if we experience a slowdown in the semiconductor industry or the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate  we may not be able to scale back our operating expenses in a sufficiently timely or effective manner 
in any such event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our past growth has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
in the past we have implemented an enterprise resource planning system to help us improve our planning and management processes  and more recently we have implemented a new equity administration system to support our more complex equity programs as well as the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
we anticipate that we will also need to continue to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  including enhanced human resources management systems and a business to business solution  as well as additional procedures and other internal management systems 
in general  the accuracy of information delivered by these systems may be subject to inherent programming quality 
in addition  to support our growth  in march we relocated our headquarters and irvine operations to new  larger facilities that have enabled us to centralize all of our irvine employees and operations on one campus 
we may also engage in other relocations of our employees or operations from time to time 
such relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit 
table of contents potential market opportunities  or conversely  we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue  either of which would materially and adversely affect our current or future business 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new semiconductor products for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner  and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitor s product into its product offering  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the customer 
even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering  we have no assurances that its product will be commercially successful or that we will receive any revenue from sales of that product 
sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products 
our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason 
our historical results have been  and we expect that our future results will continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
if we were to experience any similar delays in the successful completion of a new product or similar reductions in our manufacturing yields for a new product in the future  our customer relationships  reputation and business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  the development and introduction of new products often requires substantial research and development resources 
as a result  we may choose to discontinue one or more products or product development programs to dedicate more resources to new products 
the discontinuation of an existing or planned product may materially and adversely affect our relationship with our customers  including customers who may purchase more than one product from us 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to timely and accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely and effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets  timely complete and introduce new product designs  scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our products and services or the demand for new products requested by our customers  license any desired third party technology or intellectual property rights  effectively develop and integrate technologies from companies that we have acquired  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  achieve high manufacturing yields  and shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration 
in some of our businesses  our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully and in a timely manner may depend in part on access to information  or licenses of technology or intellectual property 
table of contents rights  from companies that are our competitors 
we cannot assure you that such information or licenses will be made available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or at reasonable cost and on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or to retain our existing customers  as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our past revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to our five largest customers represented  and of our net revenue in   and  respectively 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty  our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing or concurrent relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect the customers decisions to purchase our products  our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products  and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of resources to strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects or the development of next generation products and technologies 
delays in development could impair our relationships with strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
we may have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer  or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we currently hold more than  us and  foreign patents and 
table of contents have filed more than  additional us and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or file pending applications corresponding to our us patents and patent applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
some or all of our patents have in the past been licensed and likely will in the future be licensed to certain of our competitors through cross license agreements 
moreover  because we have participated and continue to participate in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on those standards 
certain of our software as well as that of our customers may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source software is often made available under licenses  such as the gnu general public license  or gpl  which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license  rather than the forms of license customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses  including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses 
while we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software  in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work 
with respect to our proprietary software  we generally license such software under terms that prohibit combining it with open source software as described above 
despite these restrictions  parties may combine broadcom proprietary software with open source software without our authorization  in which case we might nonetheless be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  internal or external parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  current or former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors  and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  current  departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate  counter or ameliorate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period 
also  some customers may require that we make certain intellectual property available to our competitors so that the customer has a choice among semiconductor vendors for solutions to be incorporated into the customer s products 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we have in the past been and currently are engaged in litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
it is possible that the advent of 
table of contents or developments in such litigation may adversely affect our relationships and agreements with certain customers that are either involved in such litigation or also have business relationships with the party with whom we are engaged in litigation 
such litigation and the settlement thereof has been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any litigation can divert the attention of management and other key employees from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
intellectual property risks and third party claims of infringement  misappropriation of proprietary rights or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  the defense of such claims could result in significant costs and divert the attention of our management or other key employees 
companies in and related to the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
there are various intellectual property risks associated with developing and producing new products and entering new markets  and we may not be able to obtain  at reasonable cost and upon commercially reasonable terms  licenses to intellectual property of others that is alleged to read on such new or existing products 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been and we currently are engaged in litigation with parties that claim that we infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
in addition  we or our customers may be sued by other parties that claim that our products have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or which may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of disputes could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for broadcom  increase our costs of revenue  and expose us to significant liability 
any of these claims or litigation may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market  redesign certain products offered for sale or under development  or restrict employees from performing work in their areas of expertise 
we may also be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology  and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful 
in addition  governmental agencies may commence investigations or criminal proceedings against our employees  former employees and or the company relating to claims of misappropriation or misuse of another party s proprietary rights 
we may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
we have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them 
these indemnification provisions may  in some circumstances  extend our liability beyond the products we provide to include liability for combinations of components or system level designs and for consequential damages and or lost profits 
even if claims or litigation against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees to defend 
additionally  we have sought and may in the future seek to obtain licenses under other parties intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights to others in connection with cross license agreements or settlements of claims or actions asserted against us 
however  we may not be able to obtain licenses under another s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors  suppliers or customers 
we may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
our contractors  suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is asserted against us  or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount  above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages 
in addition  we may have little or no ability to correct errors in the technology provided by such contractors  suppliers and licensors  or to continue to develop new generations of such technology 
accordingly  we may be dependent on 
table of contents their ability and willingness to do so 
in the event of a problem with such technology  or in the event that our rights to use such technology become impaired  we may be unable to ship our products containing such technology  and may be unable to replace the technology with a suitable alternative within the time frame needed by our customers 
our operating results for and prior periods have been materially and adversely impacted as a result of the voluntary review of our past equity award practices reported in january any related action by a governmental agency could result in civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our former officers  directors and or employees and might result in such sanctions against us and or certain of our current officers  directors and or employees 
such matters  and the civil litigation relating to our past equity award practices or the january restatement of our financial statements for periods ended on or before march   could result in significant costs and the diversion of attention of our management and other key employees 
in connection with the equity award review  we restated our financial statements for each of the years ended december  through december   and for the three months ended march  accordingly  you should not rely on financial information included in the reports on form k  form q and form k previously filed by broadcom  the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firm  or earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us  for periods ended on or before march   all of which have been superseded in their entirety by the information contained in our amended annual report on form k a for the year ended december  and our amended quarterly report on form q a for the three months ended march   each filed january  in june we received an informal request for information from the staff of the los angeles regional office of the sec regarding our option granting practices

henry samueli  also received a wells notice on that date 
on august  our senior vice president  business affairs and general counsel  david a 
dull  also received a wells notice 
the wells notices provide notification that the staff of the sec intends to recommend to the commission that it bring a civil action against the recipients for possible violations of the securities laws 
based on discussions with the sec staff  we believe that the issues the staff intends to pursue relate to our historical option granting processes and the accounting relating to those option grants 
under the process established by the sec  recipients have the opportunity to respond in writing to a wells notice before the sec staff makes any formal recommendation to the commission regarding what action  if any  should be brought by the sec 
dr 
samueli and mr 
dull have provided written submissions to the sec in response to the wells notices and may seek meetings with the sec staff 
in response to our wells notice  we have communicated with the sec staff in an effort to explore possible resolution and are awaiting further communication 
we are continuing to cooperate with the sec investigation  but do not know when or how the investigation will be resolved or what  if any  actions the sec may require us  dr 
samueli and or mr 
dull to take as part of that resolution 
any resolution of this investigation could result in civil sanctions and or fines against broadcom and or certain of our current or former officers  directors and or employees  as well as potential bars against certain of our current or former officers  directors and or employees serving as officers or directors of public companies 
broadcom has also been informally contacted by the us attorney s office for the central district of california and has been asked to produce on a voluntary basis documents  many of which we previously provided to the sec 
in addition  we have produced documents pursuant to grand jury subpoenas 
we are cooperating with the us attorney s office in its investigation 
the us attorney s office continues to interview present and former broadcom employees  officers and directors as part of the investigation 
any action by the us attorney s office or other governmental agency could result in criminal sanctions and or fines against broadcom and or certain of our current or former officers  directors and or employees 
additionally  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  we currently are engaged in civil litigation with parties that claim  among other allegations  that certain of our current and former directors and officers improperly dated stock option grants to enhance their own profits on the exercise of such options or for other improper purposes 
although we and the other defendants intend to defend these claims vigorously  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot 
table of contents assure you that these actions will be resolved without substantial costs and or settlement charges 
we have indemnification agreements with each of our present and former directors and officers  under which broadcom is generally required to indemnify them against expenses  including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and settlements  arising from the pending litigation subject to certain exceptions  including liabilities arising from willful misconduct  from conduct knowingly contrary to the best interests of broadcom  or conduct that is knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest or results in improper personal benefit 
the resolution of the pending investigations by the sec and us attorney s office  the defense of our pending civil litigation  and the defense of any additional litigation that may arise relating to our past equity award practices or the january restatement of our prior financial statements could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management and other key employees 
although we maintain various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business  including directors and officers insurance  we cannot assure you that the amount of our insurance coverage will be sufficient  that our insurance policies will provide coverage for the matters and circumstances described above or that portions of payments by our insurance companies previously made to us will not be required to be repaid to the insurance companies as the results of these matters reach conclusion 
our business  financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our insurance coverage fails to pay or reimburse all of the expenses and any judgments  fines or settlement costs that we may incur in connection with these matters or in the event we are required to repay amounts that were previously made by our insurance companies 
we may be unable to attract  retain or motivate key senior management and technical personnel  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel  including our co founder  chairman of the board and chief technical officer  henry samueli  phd  our chief executive officer  scott a 
mcgregor  and other senior executives 
we have employment agreements with mr 
mcgregor and eric k 
brandt  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  however the agreements do not govern the length of their service 
we do not have employment agreements with any other executives  or any other key employees  although we do have limited retention arrangements in place with certain executives 
the loss of the services of dr 
samueli  mr 
mcgregor or certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  if certain of these individuals were to leave our company unexpectedly  or if they were to be barred from serving as an officer or director as part of any resolution of the sec proceedings  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity during the search for and while any such successor is integrated into our business and operations 
furthermore  our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel  particularly software engineers  digital circuit designers  rf and mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis  we will experience difficulty in implementing our current business and product plans 
in that event  we may be unable to successfully meet competitive challenges or to exploit potential market opportunities  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
equity awards generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees 
during the time that our periodic filings with the sec were not current  as a result of the voluntary review of our equity award practices  we were not able to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to equity awards 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract  retain and motivate employees if we are unable to issue shares of our common stock pursuant to equity awards for a sustained period or in the event of substantial declines in the price of our class a common stock  such as the decline that commenced in the second half of we have also modified our compensation policies by increasing cash compensation to certain employees and instituting awards of restricted stock units  while simultaneously reducing awards of stock options 
this modification of our compensation policies and the applicability of the sfas r requirement to expense the fair value of 
table of contents equity awards to employees have increased our operating expenses 
we cannot be certain that the changes in our compensation policies will improve our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees and the increase in stock based compensation expense could each have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
five third party foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
availability of foundry capacity has at times in the past been reduced due to strong demand 
in addition  a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  the occurrence of a significant outbreak of avian influenza among humans  or another public health emergency in asia could further affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries  or in the event of a quarantine or closure at any of these foundries  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
in september two of our third party foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries  which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries experiences a shortage in capacity  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  suffers an adverse outcome in pending or future litigation  or encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may encounter supply delays or disruptions  and we may need to qualify an alternative foundry 
even our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
we typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above  including a lack of guaranteed wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs and other terms  and the unavailability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
poor yields from our foundries could result in product shortages or delays in product shipments  which could seriously harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a significant guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand 
foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use five independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  each component is typically manufactured at only one or two foundries at any given time  and if any of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed and under acceptable terms  we could experience significant delays in securing 
table of contents sufficient supplies of those components 
also  our third party foundries typically migrate capacity to newer  state of the art manufacturing processes on a regular basis  which may create capacity shortages for our products designed to be manufactured on an older process 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or on reasonable terms or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we may utilize new foundries for other products in the future  in using any new foundries we will be subject to all of the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects  or bugs  which could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  result in significant costs and claims  and adversely affect the market acceptance of new products 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain hardware or software defects or bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have previously experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contains defects or bugs  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by us  our subcontractors  suppliers and customers  it is possible that new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or field replacement costs 
these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others  including possible claims for consequential damages and or lost profits 
moreover  we may lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in addition  system and handset providers that purchase components may require that we assume liability for defects associated with products produced by their manufacturing subcontractors and require that we provide a warranty for defects or other problems which may arise at the system level 
to remain competitive  we must keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards and technologies 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these wired and wireless communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards make it difficult to formulate a long term growth strategy because the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
we have invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
if new markets do not develop as 
table of contents and when we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in those markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs that we may use in multiple products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
currently most of our products are manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron  
micron  nanometer or nanometer geometry processes 
we are now designing most new products in nanometer process technology and planning for the transition to smaller process geometries 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
the transition to nanometer geometry process technology has resulted in significantly higher mask and prototyping costs  as well as additional expenditures for engineering design tools and related computer hardware 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundry subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that the foundries that we use will be able to effectively manage the transition in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if any of our foundry subcontractors or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  if at all 
moreover  even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration  such integration may have an adverse impact on our operating results  as a result of increasing costs and expenditures as described above as well as the risk that we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip 
our acquisition strategy may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses  or be dilutive to existing shareholders 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december   we acquired companies and certain assets of three other businesses 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  and the purchase or sale of assets  including tangible and intangible assets such as intellectual property 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks  and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired 
table of contents company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the companies we have historically acquired 
acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  additional stock based compensation expense  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets  any of which items could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  we may record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future 
any of these charges could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
beginning january   the accounting for future business combinations will change 
we expect that the new requirements will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
we may seek to obtain additional cash to fund an acquisition by selling equity or debt securities 
any issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests accounting rules  the securities issued in nine of our acquisitions were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to those of our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  and any decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
as our international business expands  we are increasingly exposed to various legal  business  political and economic risks associated with our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
in addition   and of our net revenue in  and  respectively  was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
products shipped to international destinations  primarily in asia  represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
we also undertake design and development activities in belgium  canada  china  denmark  france  greece  india  israel  japan  korea  the netherlands  spain  taiwan and the united kingdom  among other locations 
in addition  we undertake various sales and marketing activities through regional offices in a number of countries 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the continuing effects of the war in iraq and terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  the resulting heightened security  and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many other inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different business practices and legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  natural disasters and public health emergencies  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  trade and travel restrictions  
table of contents the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in taxation and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 
we currently operate under tax holidays and favorable tax incentives in certain foreign jurisdictions 
for instance  in singapore we operate under tax holidays that reduce our taxes in that country on certain non investment income 
such tax holidays and incentives often require us to meet specified employment and investment criteria in such jurisdictions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet such criteria or enjoy such tax holidays and incentives  or realize any net tax benefits from tax holidays or incentives 
if any of our tax holidays or incentives are terminated  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
economic conditions in our primary overseas markets  particularly in asia  may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
in addition  a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting prior to and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  and report on  management s assessment of broadcom s internal control over financial reporting 
in assessing the findings of the voluntary equity award review as well as the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for periods ended on or before march   our management concluded that there was a material weakness  as defined in public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
 in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  management believes this material weakness was remediated september  and  accordingly  no longer exists as of the date of this filing 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  
table of contents controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
in addition  we may reassess the implementation or testing of certain of our current controls as a result of the recent release of public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
 which may lead to modifications in such controls 
these modifications could affect the overall effectiveness or evaluation of the control system in the future by us or our independent registered public accounting firm 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in our target markets 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
in all of our target markets we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions 
we expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in declining average selling prices  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
we depend on third party subcontractors to assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
if we lose the services of any of our subcontractors or if these subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials  shipments of our products may be disrupted  which could harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
seven third party subcontractors located in asia assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on 
table of contents third party subcontractors to perform these functions  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control has resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of our products or increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
in the past we and others in our industry experienced a shortage in the supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products 
if our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner  we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments  which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity  or is unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
however  even if we use these new subcontractors  we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since january  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the wired and wireless communications markets  including seasonality in sales of consumer products into which our products are incorporated  changes in accounting rules  particularly those related to the expensing of stock options  rulings in currently pending or newly instituted intellectual property litigation  other newly instituted litigation or governmental investigations or an adverse decision or outcome in any litigation or investigations  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  continuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in the methods  metrics or measures used by analysts to evaluate our stock  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other technology companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  we and other companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been  and in the future we may be  the subject of securities class action litigation 

table of contents due to the nature of our compensation packages  most of our executive officers regularly sell shares of our common stock each quarter or otherwise periodically  often pursuant to trading plans established under rule b promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act 
as a result  sales of shares by our executive officers may not be indicative of their opinion of broadcom s performance at the time of sale or of our potential future performance 
nonetheless  the market price of our stock may be affected by sales of shares by our executive officers 
our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of december  our co founders  directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including certain mergers and consolidations and the sale of substantially all of our assets 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  who is no longer an officer or director of broadcom  and dr 
henry samueli  our chairman of the board and chief technical officer  beneficially owned a total of of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions  and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions  without the approval of one or both of these shareholders 
these actions and transactions include changes in the composition of our board of directors  certain mergers  and the sale of control of our company by means of a tender offer  open market purchases or other purchases of our class a common stock  or otherwise 
repurchases of shares of our class a common stock under our share repurchase program will result in an increase in the total voting power of our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates  as well as other continuing shareholders 
some of the independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products  as well as our own california and singapore facilities  are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
one of the third party foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices is located in taiwan 
taiwan has experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster  such as a tsunami  in a country in which any of our foundries is located could significantly disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices and major design centers  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our international distribution center and some of our third party foundries are located in singapore  which could also be subject to an earthquake  tsunami or other natural disaster 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one or more of our facilities are located  our operations could be significantly disrupted 
although we have established business interruption plans to prepare for any such event  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively address all interruptions that such an event could cause 
any supply disruption or business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or accounting rules or the imposition of new laws or regulations by federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
changes in current laws or regulations or accounting rules including the possible adoption at some undetermined future date of international financial reporting standards in lieu of us gaap applicable to us or 
table of contents the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may materially and adversely impact our business 
for example  the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets in the united states 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable or satellite operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products in the united states 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
in addition  we and our customers are subject to various import and export regulations of the united states government 
changes in or violations of such regulations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have made numerous filings and applied for and received a number of export licenses under these regulations 
however  if we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations  we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at our foreign foundries or to ship these products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to environmental concerns  the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electronic components and systems is receiving increased attention 
in response  the european union passed the restriction on hazardous substances  or rohs  directive  legislation that limits the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electrical equipment 
the rohs directive became effective july  we believe that our current product designs and material supply chains are in compliance with the rohs directive 
however  it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages or delays may occur as a result of these recent regulations 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared to one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock as well as the right to vote separately as a class i as required by law and ii in the case of a proposed issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  unless such issuance is approved by at least two thirds of the members of the board of directors then in office 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue shares of common or preferred stock without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our co founders  directors and officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock  or the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for our stock 
these factors may also materially and adversely affect voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock and the market price of our class a common stock

net revenue 
our net revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we derive the remainder of our net revenue predominantly from royalty revenue from a patent license agreement  software licenses  development agreements  support and maintenance agreements  data services and cancellation fees 
the majority of our sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
the remaining balance of our sales occurs through distributors 
we sell our products to leading manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment in each of our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in multiple markets 
we utilize independent foundries and third party subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test all of our semiconductor products 
the following table presents details of our net revenue years ended december  sales of semiconductor products royalties and other years ended december  sales made through direct sales force sales made through distributors 
table of contents the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  seasonality in the demand for consumer oriented products into which certain of our products are incorporated  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the increasing volume of our products that are incorporated into consumer products  sales of which are typically subject to greater seasonality and greater volume fluctuations than non consumer oem products 
we also maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
historically we have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  since we own inventory that is physically located in a third party s warehouse  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory turns to decrease  which could increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flow 
sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows years ended december  motorola cisco five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
includes sales to scientific atlanta  which was acquired by cisco in february  for all periods presented 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 

table of contents net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the united states  as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia primarily in japan  korea  china and taiwan europe primarily in france  the united kingdom and finland other net revenue derived from shipments to international destinations  as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia primarily in china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and singapore europe primarily in hungary  germany and sweden other we have recently entered into arrangements that include multiple deliverables  such as the sale of semiconductor products and related data services 
under these arrangements  the services may be provided without having a separate fair value under eitf in that event  we will only recognize a portion of the total revenue we receive from the customer during a quarter  and will recognize the remaining revenue on a ratable basis over the expected life of the service being provided 
as we enter into future multiple element arrangements in which the fair value of each deliverable is not known  the portion of revenue we recognize on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  which could cause even greater fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
our gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales including sales to high volume customers  the positions of our products in their respective life cycles  licensing and royalty revenue  the effects of competition  the effects of competitive pricing programs and rebates  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and overhead costs  our ability to create cost advantages through successful integration and convergence  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  amortization of purchased intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense 
net income loss 
our net income loss has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  
table of contents licensing and royalty revenue  in process research and development  or ipr d  litigation costs  settlement costs  the loss of interest income resulting from expenditures on repurchases of our class a common stock  amortization of purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax benefits from adjustments to tax reserves of foreign subsidiaries  gain loss on strategic investments  and restructuring costs or reversals thereof 
in our net income was million including royalty revenue in the amount of million in the fourth quarter as compared to million in  a difference of million 
although our net revenue increased by million or to billion with gross margin of  our profitability decreased as a direct result of an increase in operating expenses of million  primarily research and development costs 
research and development costs have and will continue to increase in as we increase the number of employees engaged in research and development activities and ready a number of design wins to go into production 
research and development costs will also increase over the long term as a result of growth in  and the diversification of  the markets we serve  new product opportunities  changes in our compensation policies  and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than nine months  with an additional three to more than twelve months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
in  and we completed nine acquisitions for original total equity consideration of million and cash consideration of million 
in we acquired lvl systems  inc  a privately held developer of production ready networking software that enables networking original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers to reduce development expenses and compress development timelines  octalica  inc  a privately held fabless semiconductor company that specializes in the design and development of networking technologies based on the moca standard  which enables distribution of high quality multimedia content throughout the home over existing coaxial cable  and global locate  inc  a privately held  fabless provider of industry leading global positioning system and assisted gps semiconductor products and software 
in we acquired sandburst corporation  a fabless semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of packet switching and routing systems on a chip that are deployed in enterprise core and metropolitan ethernet networks  and encentrus systems  inc  a developer of media center technology 
in we acquired alliant networks  inc  a developer of wlan embedded software  zeevo  inc  a developer of bluetooth headset chipsets  siliquent technologies inc  a developer of gigabit ethernet server controllers  and athena semiconductors  inc  a developer of mobile digital television tuner and low power wi fi technology 

table of contents because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to these acquisitions 
business enterprise segments 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
although we had four operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas we operate in only one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 
under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments  other than royalty revenue in one of our operating segments in the fourth quarter of  the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard cmos manufacturing processes  the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment  which incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products  and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors 
all of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model  operate at gross margins similar to our consolidated gross margin  and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling  general and administrative expenses 
the causes for variation among our operating segments are the same and include factors such as i life cycle and price and cost fluctuations  ii number of competitors  iii product differentiation and iv size of market opportunity 
additionally  each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required are similar for each operating segment 
finally  even though we periodically reorganize our operating segments based upon changes in customers  end markets or products  acquisitions  long term growth strategies  and the experience and bandwidth of the senior executives in charge  the common financial goals for each operating segment remain constant 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth in sfas and our four operating segments as of december  share similar economic characteristics  we have aggregated our results of operations into one reportable operating segment 
equity award review in january we reported the results of a voluntary review of our equity award practices 
the voluntary review  which commenced in may and covered all grants of options and other equity awards made since our initial public offering in april  was directed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
based on the results of the equity award review  the audit committee concluded that  pursuant to apb and related interpretations  the accounting measurement dates for most of the stock option grants awarded between june and may  covering options to purchase million shares of our class a or class b common stock  
table of contents differed from the measurement dates previously used for such awards 
as a result  revised measurement dates were applied to the affected option grants and broadcom recorded a total of billion in additional stock based compensation expense for the years through after related tax adjustments of million  the restatement resulted in total net adjustments of billion for the years through this amount was net of forfeitures related to employee terminations 
the additional stock based compensation expense was amortized over the service period relating to each option  typically four years  with approximately of the total expense recorded in years prior to in addition  million of net adjustments was recorded in connection with our equity award review in the three months ended march  none of the grants requiring measurement date adjustment was made to our co founders or to any current or former member of our board of directors 
as a consequence of these adjustments  our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three years ended december  and our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheet data for the five years ended december  were restated 
we also restated the stock based compensation expense footnote information calculated under sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  under the disclosure only alternatives of those pronouncements for the years through the restated information was contained in our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   filed on january  the adjustments did not affect broadcom s previously reported revenue  cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities balances in any of the restated periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions  self insurance  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue  costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following are either i critical accounting policies that require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or ii other key accounting policies that generally do not require us to make estimates or judgments but may be difficult or subjective net revenue 
we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met and no significant obligations remain  when applicable 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 

table of contents for a limited number of arrangements that include multiple deliverables  such as sales of semiconductor products and services  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
if there is no established fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue and costs for the delivered element until the undelivered element has been fulfilled 
in the case that the undelivered element is a service  the revenue and costs applicable to both the delivered and undelivered elements are recorded ratably over the respective service period 
if the undelivered element is essential to the functionality of the delivered element  no revenue or costs are recognized until the undelivered element is delivered 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
we also maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
historically we have had good visibility into customer requirements and shipments within a quarter 
however  if a customer does not take our products under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  distributors and customers with hubbing arrangements provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and the end customer when products are shipped to their customer as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
for specialized shipping terms we may rely on data provided by our freight forwarding providers 
for our royalty revenue we rely on data provided by our customers 
any error in the data provided to us by customers  distributors or other third parties could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  gross profit and net income 
sales returns  pricing adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
we accrue of potential rebates at the time of sale and do not apply a breakage factor 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
thus the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our revenue  gross profit and net income in subsequent periods 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any customer were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory and warranty reserves 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers  we own inventory that is physically located in a customer s or third party s warehouse 
as a result  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease 
in that event  our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from 
table of contents our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross profit and gross margins would be reduced 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january  we adopted sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our equity awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
had we adopted sfas r in  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and 
table of contents estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
in july the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the other party s intellectual property rights that could require one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact gross profit and gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for broadcom 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

the increase in net revenue from our mobile and wireless target market resulted primarily from strong growth driven by new products and customer ramps for our bluetooth solutions  as well as royalty revenue in the amount of million from a patent license agreement entered into in july we recorded rebates to certain customers of million and million in and  respectively 
we account for rebates in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and  accordingly  at the time of the sale we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to revenue and do not apply a breakage factor 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in our various rebate agreements 
we anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based upon the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs 
we reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
we reversed accrued rebates in the amount of million and million in and  respectively 
we currently anticipate that total net revenue in the first quarter of will be approximately million to billion  as compared to billion achieved in the fourth quarter of  in each case including royalty revenue at similar levels as reported in the fourth quarter of from a patent licensing agreement entered into in july this decrease is primarily the result of the seasonal decline in revenue in our consumer oriented businesses 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and stock based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support 
the increase in absolute dollars of gross profit resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue 
gross margin increased from in to in the primary factors that contributed to the increase in gross margin were i an increase in product margin due to a decrease in product costs  ii a shift in product mix  iii royalty revenue in the amount of million  and iv an increase in the reversal of rebates in the amount of million related to unclaimed rebates 
for a discussion of stock based compensation included in cost of revenue  see stock based compensation expense  below 
gross margin has been and will likely continue to be impacted by our product mix and volume of product sales  including sales to high volume customers  royalty revenue  competitive pricing programs  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly  packaging and testing costs  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and 
table of contents the introduction of products with lower margins  among other factors 
we anticipate that our gross margin in the first quarter of will slightly decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of as we continue to ramp a number of new products to new and existing customers 
typically our newly introduced products have lower gross margins until we commence volume production and launch lower cost revisions of such products enabling us to benefit from economies of scale and more efficient designs 
our gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense and changes therein  as discussed below  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions

research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  including stock based compensation expense 
research and development expense also includes costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  mask and prototyping costs  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in personnel related expenses and an increase of million in stock based compensation expense 
these increases are primarily attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities since the end of  resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions 
employees engaged in research and development activities at december  increased to  or by over the previous year 
we also had increases in costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware that were attributable to the increase in headcount 
in addition  facilities costs increased due to the build out and relocation of our irvine facilities 
there were increased mask and prototyping costs during due to the transition of certain products to nanometer process technology 
these costs vary from period to period depending on the timing of development and tape out of various products 
for a further discussion of stock based compensation included in research and development expense  see stock based compensation expense  below 
we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in as we ready a number of design wins to go into production and over the long term as a result of growth in  and the diversification of  the markets we serve  new product opportunities  and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
we anticipate that research and development expense in the first quarter of will increase from the million incurred in the fourth quarter of  but at a slower rate than we experienced in  due to our continued investment in new products and the migration to nanometer process technology  as well as additional expenses related to the hiring of additional personnel 
we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate 
we currently hold more than  us and  foreign patents  and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and communications expenses 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense resulted primarily from a decrease of million in legal fees  offset by an increase of million in personnel related expenses 
the increase in personnel related expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in selling  general and administrative activities since the end of  resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions 
employees engaged in selling  general and administrative activities increased to  or by over the previous year 
in addition  facilities costs increased due to the build out and relocation of our irvine facilities 
legal fees fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and costs of our ongoing litigation matters 
we maintain insurance polices that limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of our legal fees paid related to our equity award review 
in we received or recorded receivables for reimbursements in the amount of million related to costs recoverable under these insurance policies  which are reflected as an offset to legal expense 
in certain limited circumstances  portions of these amounts recovered from our insurance carriers may be required to be repaid 
we regularly evaluate the need to record a liability for potential future repayments in accordance with sfas  and as of december  we have not recorded a liability in connection with these potential insurance recovery provisions 
for a discussion of stock based compensation included in selling  general and administrative expense  see stock based compensation expense  below

charges related to the voluntary review of our equity award practices in connection with our equity award review  the results of which were reported in january  we determined the accounting measurement dates for most of our options granted between june and may covering options to purchase million shares of our class a or class b common stock  differed from the measurement dates previously used for such awards 
as a result  there are potential adverse tax consequences that may apply to holders of affected options 
by amending or replacing those options  the potential adverse tax consequences could be eliminated 
in march we offered to amend or replace options affected by the choice of measurement dates by adjusting the exercise price of each such option to the lower of i the fair market value per share of our class a common stock on the revised measurement date applied to that option as a result of our equity award review or ii the closing selling price per share of our class a common stock on the date on which the option would be amended 
if the adjusted exercise price for an affected option was lower than the original exercise price  that option was not amended but instead was replaced with a new option that had the same exercise price  vesting schedule and expiration date as the affected option  but a new grant date 
the offer expired april  participants whose options were amended pursuant to the offer were paid a special cash payment with respect to those options 
the amount paid was determined by multiplying i the amount of the increase in exercise price by ii the number of shares for which options were amended 
we made payments of million in january to reimburse the affected optionholders for the increases in their exercise prices 
a liability was recorded for these payments and included in wages and related benefits as of december  in accordance with sfas r  we recorded total estimated charges of million in and a reduction of additional paid in capital in the amount of million in connection with the offer

the payments were i to remunerate participants in our employee stock purchase plan who were unable to purchase shares thereunder during the period in which we were not current in our sec reporting obligations  ii to remediate adverse tax consequences  if any  to individuals that resulted from the review  and iii to compensate individuals for the value of stock options that expired or would have expired during the period in which we were not current in our sec reporting obligations

 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent the fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects as of the respective acquisition dates

impairment of intangible assets we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with various acquisitions as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in october and upon completion of the and annual impairment assessments  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of our four reporting units  determined and identified in accordance with sfas  exceeded its respective carrying value 
we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our board of directors 
cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology

the differences between our effective tax rates and the federal statutory tax rate primarily relate to foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal tax rate and domestic tax losses recorded without tax benefits 
in addition  we realized tax benefits resulting from the reversal of certain prior period tax accruals of million and million in and  respectively 
these reversals resulted primarily from the expiration of the statutes of limitations for the assessment of taxes related to certain foreign subsidiaries 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
sfas states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million in and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash and marketable securities 
the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities december  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital 
our working capital  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased in primarily due to repurchases of shares of our class a common stock  offset by cash provided by operations 
for a more detailed description of cash provided or used in and  see below 

table of contents cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents increased to billion at december  from billion at december  as a result of the following december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period in our operating activities provided million in cash 
this was primarily the result of million in net income  million in net non cash operating expenses and cash of million provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d  impairment of intangible assets and losses on strategic investments 
in our operating activities provided million in cash 
this was primarily the result of million in net income and million in net non cash operating expenses  offset in part by net cash used of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d and gains on strategic investments 
accounts receivable decreased million from million in to million in we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
inventories increased million  from million in to million in in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon the level of purchase orders we receive and the stage at which our products are in their respective product life cycles  our ability  and the ability of our customers  to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements  as well as competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million provided by the net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of million received in connection with an escrow settlement from our acquisition of siliquent  offset in part by the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the build out and relocation of our facilities in irvine  california and million net cash paid for the acquisitions of lvl  octalica and global locate and other purchased intangible assets 
investing activities used cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million net cash paid in acquisitions  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the build out of our new facilities in irvine  california  million used in the net purchase of marketable securities  and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset by million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments 
our financing activities used million in cash in  which was primarily the result of billion in repurchases of our class a common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs  offset by million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities provided million in cash in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by million in repurchases of our class a common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs 
due to the decrease in the average price of our class a common stock as compared to the previous year  fewer stock options were exercised by employees  and we received reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock 
table of contents options in the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our practice to issue a combination of restricted stock units and stock options to employees  which will reduce the number of stock options available for exercise in the future 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to broadcom and requires the use of cash  as we currently allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units during and withheld to satisfy minimum statutory withholding taxes which we then pay in cash to the appropriate tax authorities on each employee s behalf 
obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year thereafter total in thousands operating leases inventory and related purchase obligations other purchase obligations restructuring liabilities accrued settlement payments total we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through in december we entered into a lease agreement under which our corporate headquarters moved in to our current facilities in irvine  california with an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
the lease term is for a period of ten years and two months which began in march the aggregate rent for the term of the lease  approximately million  is included in the table above 
inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
we depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months 
our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment  computer hardware  and information systems infrastructure  mask and prototyping costs  and other purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
our restructuring liabilities represent estimated future lease and operating costs from restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income  if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with certain settlement and license agreements entered into in and these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

table of contents in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of million and million  respectively  at december  prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments and repurchases of our class a common stock for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
if needed  we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
we could also reduce certain expenditures  such as repurchases of our class a common stock 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement on sec form s that allows us to sell in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
we have not issued any securities under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  repurchases of our class a common stock  required levels of research and development and other operating costs  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  royalties payable by or to us  changes in our compensation policies  the issuance of restricted stock units and the related cash payments we make for withholding taxes due from employees during and possibly during future years  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products and our anticipation of and responses to their products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  the availability and cost of sufficient foundry  assembly and test capacity and packaging materials  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets  including the effects of recent international conflicts and related uncertainties 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
marketable securities  consisting of us government obligations  commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
if in the future we hold marketable securities classified as available for sale  unrealized gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
as of december  the carrying value and fair value of these securities were million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our marketable securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates  however  given the short term maturities  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
investments in fixed rate  interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  anticipated declining interest rates will negatively impact our investment income 
the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and  respectively  were as follows carrying fair value value december  maturity december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average yield marketable securities weighted average yield carrying fair value value december  maturity december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average yield marketable securities weighted average yield we also have invested in privately held companies  the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage 
we make investments in key strategic businesses and other industry participants to 
table of contents establish strategic relationships  expand existing relationships  and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in early stages and may never materialize 
likewise  the development projects of these companies may not be successful 
in addition  early stage companies often fail for various other reasons 
consequently  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
as of december   the carrying and fair value of our strategic investments was million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future
