actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this report 
executive overview business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we believe that apartment communities are an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer 
our communities are predominately upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
financial highlights and outlook net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended december  was  as compared to  for the quarter ended december   an increase of 
for the year ended december   net income available to common stockholders was  compared to  for  an increase of 
these increases are primarily attributable to an increase in gains from the sale of communities and joint venture real estate investments in as compared to and growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in apartment fundamentals remained positive in as evidenced by full year over year rental revenue growth of achieved within our established community portfolio as defined later in this report  comprised of an increase in rental rates of and a decrease in occupancy of 
this revenue growth combined with constrained expense growth contributed to our established community portfolio achieving year over year growth in net operating income noi of in for the fourth quarter of  our established communities experienced an increase in rental revenue of and a corresponding increase in noi of over the prior year period  evidencing the moderating  but continued growth in operations 
projected growth in earnings per share diluted eps in our current financial outlook is expected to be between and driven primarily by gains on the sale of communities that may occur under our expanded disposition program 
in addition  we expect that our established communities will continue to show revenue and net operating income growth in  but at a lesser rate relative to growth levels in despite third party forecasts of a weaker economic environment  we anticipate positive renter demand resulting from a continued reduction in homeownership rates and a general increase in the propensity to rent 
declining home ownership rates are the result of a number of factors  including concerns regarding home prices and economic growth  demographic growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent as well as tighter underwriting standards for mortgages 
management expects the level of new rental completions in the company s markets will decline modestly during from levels and competition from unsold housing inventory made available for rent will remain modest relative to more oversupplied residential markets in the us overall we expect apartment market fundamentals will be balanced in our markets  supporting moderate growth in earnings 
our current financial outlook provides for rental growth of to in our established community portfolio and projected noi growth of to we expect that our development activity will continue to create long term value 
we currently have approximately  under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion  including the portions in which joint venture partners hold an equity or economic interest 
for  we expect new development starts in the range of  to  measured at projected cost of completion  including projects that may be developed through joint ventures 
this is a decrease in new activity from reflecting the current economic and capital market conditions 
we continue to be selective in pursuing new development opportunities 
land prices generally have not re set in most of our markets  but we are seeing construction cost increases stabilizing 
construction costs for certain materials have begun to decline while prices for other materials remain high given strong global demand 
there is also greater availability of experienced subcontractors and trade professionals as a result of slowing construction in both the condominium and single family housing markets 
we continue to selectively secure new development rights  including the acquisition of land for future development 
we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that would  if developed as expected  total approximately  based on total projected capitalized costs at december  we also expect to increase our redevelopment activities in  for both wholly owned and fund as defined below related assets 
while current market conditions with respect to liquidity may impact the types of funding sources used  we believe that our current level of indebtedness  our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing on our assets provide us with the financial position and financial flexibility to access the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities 
we expect to meet these needs from both secured and unsecured debt  as well as asset sales and retained cash 
avalonbay value added fund  lp the fund is a discretionary investment fund in which we hold a interest 
the fund has been our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions  since its formation in march the fund acquired seven communities for an aggregate purchase price of  during as of january   the total amount invested by the fund is  management of the fund expects to invest approximately  of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired  at which time  the fund will become fully invested 
we are exploring various potential sources and vehicles for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 
we continue to see real estate capital flows from income investors 
in  we completed the disposition of four communities and one partnership interest for an aggregate gross sales price of  given the current levels of demand from investors for high quality multifamily real estate assets  we anticipate increasing our level of disposition activity to a range of  to  in actual disposition activity will depend on various factors including market and economic conditions 
communities overview our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights ie  land or options to purchase land held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities  and discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
the net operating income of our current operating communities  as defined later in this report  is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels  and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and eight communities were under reconstruction 
of these communities  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes  including owned by the fund 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals as measured by changes in net operating income of our established communities  net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities  and capital market  disposition and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management interest expense  net depreciation expense general and administrative expense total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities minority interest in consolidated partnerships gain on sale of land income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of communities total discontinued operations net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased  or  to  in due primarily to sales of consolidated operating communities and investments in unconsolidated entities and related gains occurring in combined with growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities in net income available to common stockholders decreased  or  to  in  primarily attributable to reduced asset sales and the related gains  partially offset by growth in net operating income from established communities and contributions to net operating income from newly developed communities 
net operating income noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi for the years ended december   and  along with reconciliation to net income for each year  is as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income indirect operating expenses  net of corporate income investments and investment management interest expense  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities minority interest in consolidated partnerships depreciation expense gain on sale of real estate assets income from discontinued operations net operating income the noi increases in both and  as compared to the prior year period  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands increase increase established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total the noi increases in established communities in were largely due to continued favorable apartment market fundamentals 
during  we continued to focus on rental rate growth  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all regions 
we anticipate that increases in rental rates and overall rental revenue growth will moderate in as compared to  as we expect a slower rate of job growth demand and a decline in new rental completions in our markets supply 
we expect revenue growth from our established communities of to in as compared to in addition  we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth 
we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by to in as compared to from increasing property tax  labor and utility expenses 
overall  we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of to in as compared to the company has given projected noi growth in only for established communities and not on a company wide basis 
the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities 
however  the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a company wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts  dispositions and acquisitions  as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate level property management overhead  general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed  disposed or acquired 
noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 
rental and other income increased in as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates for our established communities  coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  apartment homes for and  apartment homes for this change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities  partially offset by communities sold in and the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  in as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  for and increased  or in these increases are due to increased average rental rates  partially offset by decreased economic occupancy 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to increased market rents and the decrease in the amortization of concessions 
the higher amortization recognized in was due to the higher levels of concessions granted in periods prior to the average economic occupancy decreased to in economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we experienced increases in established communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in as compared to the largest increases in rental revenue were in the pacific northwest  northern california and the mid atlantic  with increases of  and  respectively  between years 
the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue  and therefore are discussed in more detail below 
northern california  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of in as compared to average rental rates increased by to  and economic occupancy increased to in apartment fundamentals remain strong in northern california 
we expect northern california to see continued but moderating revenue growth during at growth levels in excess of those expected in other markets 
the northeast region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of in as compared to average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy decreased to in we expect overall apartment fundamentals in the northeast region will be balanced during  with slower job growth and except in the boston area  minimal net new rental supply 
supply demand fundamentals for new york city and surrounding areas should remain healthy  although changes in employment levels in the financial services industry could cause economic growth to decelerate 
boston will continue to lag the region in revenue growth  as we expect the net new supply from apartment deliveries will outpace improvement in the region s economy 
these factors support our expectation for moderate rental rate growth in in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not comparable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a management  development and other fees decreased  or in and increased  or in the decrease in was due to lower development and redevelopment management fees  coupled with the loss of fees due to the disposition of our interest in a joint venture  partially offset by increased property management fees from the fund  as additional communities are acquired 
the increase in over was due to a full year of management fees from the fund  which was formed in march direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or  and  or  to  and  in and  respectively  due primarily to increases in other maintenance  marketing and landscaping expenses offset by lower utility and redecorating costs 
property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes 
property taxes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 
for established communities  property taxes increased by  or  and  or in and  respectively  due to higher assessments throughout all regions 
year over year changes are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 
overall  we expect property taxes in to increase from levels due to increased valuations and the addition of newly developed communities 
despite the potential decreases in real estate property values for tax purposes  there is generally a lag to the ultimate recognition of any savings in the real estate tax assessments 
in addition  property tax increases are limited by law proposition for communities in california 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  as well as engage third party consultants  and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by  or and  or  in and  respectively  over the prior year periods due primarily to increased costs relating to corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities  coupled with increased compensation and relocation costs 
the expense includes the set up costs related to the office in virginia beach  virginia that we opened in this office will be used to centralize certain community related accounting  administrative and customer service functions 
the transition began during the third quarter of  when certain community related accounting functions were relocated to our virginia beach office and is expected to continue through the end of expenses in this category increased in  primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes coupled with expense growth in our established communities 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions  investment management and abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits  acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits 
investments and investment management costs increased in as compared to due primarily to increased abandoned pursuit costs 
abandoned pursuit costs were  in   in and  in abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile  and the costs incurred in any given period may vary significantly in future periods 
interest expense  net decreased  or in and  or in due primarily to higher levels of capitalized interest in connection with our increased development activity and increased interest income  partially offset by an increase in the average outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility 
interest income increased in due to higher invested cash balances from our january equity offering as well as increases in the interest rate earned on cash deposits  offset partially by interest income in from an escrow funded from a disposition in that was used in a tax deferred exchange 
depreciation expense increased  or in and  or in primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities  partially offset by the loss of depreciation from assets sold 
general and administrative expense g a increased  or in primarily due to increased compensation costs 
g a expenses decreased  or in primarily due to the incurrence in of the following i separation costs of approximately  due to the departure of a senior executive  ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately  and iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability in  partially offset by higher compensation costs in gain on sale of land in decreased from due to the volume and size of land parcels sold in each year 
the increase in from is due to larger gains on sales in equity in income of unconsolidated entities in increased from due primarily to the recognition in of approximately  in gains from the disposition of two investments  partially offset by losses after depreciation associated with two unconsolidated investments and the consolidation in of a community that was not consolidated as of december  minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in as compared to due to the recognition of the sale of a joint venture partner interest in one of our consolidated communities see note  investment in real estate entities 
this increase was partially offset by the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units  thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests 
the year over year decrease in was due to the conversion of limited partnership units  reducing the outside ownership interests 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january  through december  it decreased in and due to fewer communities sold or classified as discontinued operations 
see note  real estate disposition activities  of our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of communities increased in due to the higher volume of dispositions in the decrease in as compared to is due to the volume and size of dispositions in the respective years relative to our basis in the assets 
the amount of gain realized in any given reporting period depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the sales prices  which are driven by local and national market conditions 
funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance 
in calculating ffo  we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates 
ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere this report 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities  as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  preferred stock dividends and downreit partnership unit distributions  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  and capital calls for the fund  as required 
increased capital market volatility in and constrained liquidity suggest that our liquidity needs may be met in from sources that differ from historical sources 
increased use of secured debt and increased asset sales relative to our recent activity are expected for although general market liquidity is constrained  we anticipate that we can satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility  as well as secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in the increase was driven primarily by the additional noi from our established communities operations  as well as noi from recently developed communities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through the development and redevelopment of apartment communities  the acquisition of a community  and the acquisition of land parcels  partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of a land parcel  four communities and a partnership interest in an unconsolidated real estate investment 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of the following real estate and capital expenditures we completed the development of eight communities containing a total of  apartment homes for a total capitalized cost  including land acquisition cost  of  we acquired parcels of land in connection with development rights  for an aggregate purchase price of  we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of  we commenced the development of communities which are expected to contain a total of  apartment homes for an expected aggregate total capital cost of  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in the net cash inflow is due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock at per share  borrowings of  under our unsecured credit facility and the issuance of two mortgage notes for approximately  offset by the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  the repayment of mortgage notes of approximately  the repayment of unsecured notes at maturity of approximately  and dividend payments of  variable rate unsecured credit facility in november  we increased our borrowing capacity under our existing revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility from  to  the facility is with a syndicate of commercial banks  to whom we pay  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of approximately  the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit rating 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january  we are subject to and currently in compliance with certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility  including  but not limited to  maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios  a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels 
the credit facility matures in november  assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
at january    was outstanding on the credit facility   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our unsecured credit facility or by equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
the following financing activity occurred during the year ended december  we issued  of variable rate mortgage debt for an operating community in june  maturing in may  we repaid  of mortgage debt  secured by the assets of an operating community in july  we assumed  of fixed rate mortgage debt in conjunction with the acquisition of an operating community in july and subsequently defeased the note in december  we issued  of variable rate  tax exempt debt for a development community in june  maturing in november  we repaid  in previously issued unsecured notes in august  along with any unpaid interest  pursuant to their scheduled maturity  we issued  of fixed rate  tax exempt mortgage debt for an operating community in september  maturing in june  we were relieved of our obligations associated with  in mortgage debt in conjunction with the disposition of the associated operating community in september  we repaid  in previously issued unsecured notes in december  along with any unpaid interest  pursuant to their scheduled maturity  we borrowed  under our unsecured credit facility  we increased our borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility by  to  we issued  shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately  in conjunction with the inclusion of our common stock in the s p index in january  and we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total approximate purchase price of in february  the board of directors authorized a further increase of  in the common stock repurchase program  increasing the total amount the company can acquire to  of which approximately  has been used to repurchase our common stock as of january  the decision to use the additional share repurchase authorization will depend on current capital market conditions and liquidity  our share price relative to the net asset value per share and other uses of capital  including development

these notes were repaid at their scheduled maturity in january future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had eight communities which we own  or in which we have a direct or indirect interest  under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from cash currently on hand invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  and short term investment vehicles  the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the fund as discussed below  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
we have invested in the fund  a private  discretionary investment vehicle that acquires and operates apartment communities in our markets 
the fund has invested  as of december  management of the fund expects to invest approximately  of additional funds to redevelop the assets acquired  at which time the fund will become fully invested 
the fund has nine institutional investors  including us  with a combined capital equity commitment of  a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors have been made through avalonbay value added fund  inc  a maryland corporation that qualifies as a reit under the internal revenue code the fund reit 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed  to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately  has been invested as of january  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
as of january   the fund has committed to invest approximately  we are exploring various potential sources for funding future acquisitions after the fund is fully invested 
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk or secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
in response to real estate and capital markets conditions  we sold four communities and one partnership interest in an unconsolidated entitiy for an aggregate sales price of  from january  through january  because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs 
during  we intend to dispose of between  and  in assets 
however  actual disposition volume will depend on market conditions and other variables  which are subject to change in off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities  we have certain off balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest 
additional discussion of these entities can be found in note  investments in real estate entities  and note  commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 
cvp i  llc has outstanding tax exempt  variable rate bonds maturing in november in the amount of  which have permanent credit enhancement 
we have agreed to guarantee  under limited circumstances  the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of cvp i  llc s repayment obligations under the bonds 
we have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that cvp i  llc will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project chrystie place in new york city overall once tenant improvements related to a retail tenant are complete  which is expected in the first half of our partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under these guarantees  both at inception and as of december  were not significant 
as a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at december  mvp i  llc executed a construction loan in the amount of  to finance the development of avalon at mission bay north ii 
in conjunction with the construction management services that the company provided to mvp i  llc  the company provided a construction completion guarantee to the construction loan lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to construction financing 
in the fourth quarter of  all of the lender s standard completion requirements were satisfied and the obligation of the company under this guarantee terminated 
in december  mvp i  llc repaid the construction loan  concurrently executing a seven year  fixed rate conventional loan 
the fund has loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of  these mortgage loans have varying maturity dates or dates after which the loans can be prepaid  ranging from october to september these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
in addition  the fund had amounts outstanding of  as of december  under its credit facilities  all of which is under an unsecured facility maturing in december the fund did not have any amounts outstanding at december  under the fund s credit facility secured by uncalled capital commitments that matured in january the mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate  and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments 
we have not guaranteed the debt of the fund  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the fund be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of the fund  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that if  upon final liquidation of the fund  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the fund whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
as of december   the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the fund is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under a liquidation scenario 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  in connection with the pursuit of a development right in pleasant hill  california   in bond financing was issued by the contra costa county redevelopment agency the agency in connection with the possible future construction of a multifamily rental community by phvp i  llc 
the bond proceeds were immediately invested in their entirety in a guaranteed investment contract gic administered by a trustee 
this development right is planned as a mixed use development  with residential  for sale  retail and office components 
the bond proceeds will remain in the gic until august  at which time a loan will be made to phvp i  llc to fund construction of the multifamily portion of the development  or the bonds will be redeemed by the agency 
we are currently in discussions to extend both the term until the bond financing proceeds must be used for development of the multifamily portion of the project  and the gic until august  when construction of the multifamily portion of the development is now expected to begin 
although we do not have any equity or economic interest in phvp i  llc at this time  we do have an option to make a capital contribution to phvp i  llc in exchange for a general partner interest in the entity 
should we decide not to exercise this option  bond proceeds will be released from escrow  the bonds will be redeemed without penalty and a loan will not be made to phvp i  llc 
the bonds are payable from the proceeds of the gic and are non recourse to both phvp i  llc and to us 
there is no loan payable outstanding by phvp i  llc as of december  in addition  as part of providing construction management services to phvp i  llc for the construction of a public garage  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing 
our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion of the garage once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied  which we currently expect to occur in the first half of in the third quarter of  significant modifications were requested by the local transit authority to change the garage structure design 
we do not believe that the requested design changes impact the construction schedule 
however  it is expected that these changes will increase the original budget by an amount up to  we believe that substantially all potential additional amounts are reimbursable from unrelated third parties 
at this time we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur any additional costs 
the estimated fair value of  and our obligation under this guarantee  both at inception and as of december  was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we admitted a venture partner to the avalon del rey apartments  llc for an investment of  including the assumption of debt 
in conjunction with this investment  we provided an operating guarantee to the joint venture partner which stated that if the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner was less than a threshold return of on its initial equity investment  we would pay the joint venture partner an amount equal to the shortfall  up to the threshold return required 
in the fourth quarter of  the initial year return earned by the joint venture partner was determined to be in excess of the guarantee threshold thereby satisfying all provisions of the company under this guarantee 
there are no other lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 
contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an operating lease for  square feet of office space in virginia beach  virginia 
we began to utilize this space for certain of our community related accounting and customer service functions in the third quarter of there have not been any other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes  outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of december  the table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in see liquidity and capital resources 
amounts exclude interest payable as of december includes land leases expiring between november and march amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these ventures  whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements  applying the guidance of fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised and emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
for investment interests that we do not consolidate  we look to the guidance in aicpa statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  and emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments  to determine the accounting framework to apply 
the application of these rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
therefore  we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december   our assets would have increased by  and our liabilities would have increased by  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed  including but not limited to the following reasons  none of which are currently expected to occur for entities not considered to be variable interest entities under fin r  the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity 
for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and or variable interest  the contractual arrangement changes resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and or variable interest 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
for redevelopment efforts  we capitalize costs beginning either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed  or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct and those indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities 
these costs include interest and related loan fees  property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs 
interest is capitalized for any project specific financing  as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects 
indirect project costs  which include personnel and office and administrative costs  that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts are also capitalized 
the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment  and as such  we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 
there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to development or redevelopment activity 
if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  there may be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if in our development activities decreased by  and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs  our operating expenses would have increased by we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the acquisition or development of an apartment community  and therefore should be capitalized  the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate 
if it were determined that of our capitalized pursuits were no longer probable of occurring  net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by  asset impairment evaluation we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine the need for performing impairment analyses  as well as to measure the loss if an impairment has occurred on a regular basis  considering qualitative economic factors 
because each asset is unique  requiring significant management judgment  we believe that the asset impairment evaluation is a critical accounting estimate 
management judgment is required both to determine if a significant event has occurred  such that an impairment analysis is necessary  as well as for the assessment and measurement of any potential impairment 
to perform the impairment analysis  we must estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset  which in the case of an apartment community would be the noi  as well as potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period as well as disposition proceeds 
in addition  when an impairment has occurred  we must estimate the discount factor  or market capitalization rate to apply to the undiscounted cash flows to derive the fair value of the position 
the market capitalization rate is influenced by many factors  including national and local economic conditions  as well as the location and quality of the asset 
changes in the future cash flows associated with an asset have a direct  linear relationship to the fair value of the position 
for example  if there is a decline in the estimated noi for a community  there would be a corresponding decrease in the fair value of that asset of 
changes in the market capitalization rate have an inverse relationship with the fair value of an asset  with a decrease in the market capitalization rate resulting in an increase in the fair value of the asset 
for example  an asset that is valued at  when using a five percent market capitalization rate will increase in value to  if the market capitalization rate decreases by one percent to four percent  and to  if the market capitalization rate decreases by two percent  to a three percent market capitalization rate 
for the year ended december   we did not recognize any impairment in value associated with our investments or long lived assets 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
for example  if we failed to qualify as a reit in  our net income would have decreased by approximately  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment 
therefore  we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being interest rate risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates  primarily associated with short term interest rates such as libor 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of interest rate swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but  rather  was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain tax exempt bond financings 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  lower in and  higher in because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  computed using a discounted cash flow model considering our current market yields  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt excluding our variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency or equity price risk  and our exposure to commodity price risk is insignificant
