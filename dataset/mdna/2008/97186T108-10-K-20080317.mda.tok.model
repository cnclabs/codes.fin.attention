item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and capital adequacy requirements for further information regarding the regulatory capital guidelines as well as the company s and the bank s actual capitalization as of december  the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks which are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under the capital guidelines  a banking organization s total capital is divided into tiers 
tier i capital includes common equity and trust preferred securities  subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits 
tier ii capital includes hybrid capital instruments  other qualifying debt instruments  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
the risk based capital guidelines require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk weighted assets of 
an institution s risk based capital  leverage capital and tangible capital ratios together determine the institution s capital classification 
an institution is treated as well capitalized if its total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  its core capital to risk weighted assets ratio is or more  and its core capital to adjusted average assets ratio is or more 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated well capitalized  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets must be 
the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  which emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements  currently becomes mandatory for large international banks outside the us in  is optional for others  and must be complied with in a parallel run for two years along with the existing basel i standards 
a separate rule is expected to be released and issued in final form by the federal regulatory agencies in which will offer us banks that will not adopt basel ii an alternative standardized approach under basel ii option and address concerns that the basel ii framework may offer significant competitive advantages for the largest us and international banks 
the us banking agencies have indicated  however  that they will retain the minimum leverage requirement for all us banks 
further revisions and proposals to the basel ii framework may also occur in response to recent adverse liquidity and securitization developments 
the federal deposit insurance act fdia gives the federal banking agencies the additional broad authority to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions that fall within any undercapitalized category  including requiring the submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted non capital safety and soundness standards to assist examiners in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset quality and growth  v earnings  vi risk management  and vii compensation and benefits 
the fdic improvement act the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia  made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions  and improvement of accounting standards 
this statute also limited deposit insurance coverage  implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions 
fdicia requires every bank with total assets in excess of million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
fdicia also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital 
fdicia divides banks into five different categories  depending on their level of capital 
under regulations adopted by the fdic  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more  and the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a certain capital level 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more unless it receives the highest composite rating at its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  in which instance it must maintain a leverage ratio of or more 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier capital ratio of less than and a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 
in addition  the fdic has the ability to downgrade a bank s classification but not to critically undercapitalized based on other considerations even if the bank meets the capital guidelines 
according to these guidelines the bank was classified as well capitalized as of december  in addition  if a bank is classified as undercapitalized  the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the federal banking regulators 
pursuant to fdicia  an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets  engaging in a new line of business  acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution  or opening or acquiring a new branch office  except under certain circumstances  including the acceptance by the federal banking regulators of a capital restoration plan for the bank 
furthermore  if a bank is classified as undercapitalized  the federal banking regulators may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank  if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  the federal banking regulators would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions 
these actions would include  among other things  requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital  improvements in management  limits on interest rates paid  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers 
if a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized  fdicia requires the bank to be placed into conservatorship or receivership within days  unless the federal banking regulators determines that other action would better achieve the purposes of fdicia regarding prompt corrective action with respect to undercapitalized banks 
the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank 
under fdicia  the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full scope  on site examination of every bank at least once every months 
an exception to this rule is made  however  that provides that banks i with assets of less than million  ii are categorized as well capitalized  iii were found to be well managed and its composite rating was outstanding  and iv have not been subject to a change in control during the last months  need only be examined once every months 
brokered deposits under fdicia  banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
the bank is currently well capitalized and therefore is not subject to any limitations with respect to its brokered deposits 
federal limitations on activities and investments the equity investments and activities as a principal of fdic insured state chartered banks  such as the bank  are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks 
under regulations dealing with equity investments  an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type  or in an amount  that is not permissible for a national bank 
fdic deposit insurance assessments banks must pay assessments to the fdic for federal deposit insurance protection 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system as required by fdicia 
under this system  fdic insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications that is  institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments in certain instances 
the fdic may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order  or condition imposed by the fdic 
the bank s deposit insurance assessments may increase or decrease depending on the risk assessment classification to which it are assigned by the fdic 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings 
check clearing for the st century act on october   the check clearing for the st century act  also known as check  was enacted 
check  which became effective in october  gives substitute checks  such as a digital image of a check and copies made from that image  the same legal standing as the original paper check 
some of the major provisions include allowing check truncation without making it mandatory  demanding that every financial institution communicate to account holders in writing a description of its substitute check processing program and their rights under the law  legalizing substitutions for and replacements of paper checks without agreement from consumers  retaining in place the previously mandated electronic collection and return of checks between financial institutions only when individual agreements are in place  requiring that when account holders request verification  financial institutions produce the original check or a copy that accurately represents the original and demonstrate that the account debit was accurate and valid  and requiring recrediting of funds to an individual s account on the next business day after a consumer proves that the financial institution has erred 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as implemented by the congress in  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra requires federal examiners  in connection with the examination of a financial institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank has a compliance committee  which oversees the planning of products  and services offered to the community  especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities 
the fdic rated the bank as satisfactory in meeting community credit needs under cra at its most recent examination for cra performance 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement and procedures act  the fair credit reporting act and the federal trade commission act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
permissible activities and subsidiaries california law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
therefore  the bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so called closely related to banking or non banking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries  and further  pursuant to glba  the bank may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank  provided the bank is and remains well capitalized  well managed and in satisfactory compliance with cra 
presently  the bank does not have any financial subsidiaries 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the federal reserve board finalized joint rules required by the financial services regulatory relief act of to implement exceptions provided in the glba for securities activities that banks may conduct without registering with the sec as a securities broker or moving such activities to a broker dealer affiliate 
the federal reserve board s final regulation r provides exceptions for networking arrangements with third party broker dealers and authorities  including sweep accounts to money market funds  and with related trust  fiduciary  custodial and safekeeping needs 
the final rules  which will not be effective until  are not expected to have a material effect on the bank as it does not have any securities activities 
interstate branching under current law  california state banks are permitted to establish branch offices throughout california with prior regulatory approval 
in addition  with prior regulatory approval  banks are permitted to acquire branches of existing banks located in california 
finally  california state banks generally may branch across state lines by merging with banks in other states if allowed by the applicable states laws 
california law  with limited exceptions  currently permits branching across state lines through interstate mergers resulting in the acquisition of a whole california bank that has been in existence for at least five years 
under the federal deposit insurance act  states may opt in and allow out of state banks to branch into their state by establishing a new start up branch in the state 
california law currently prohibits de novo branching into the state of california 
the bank currently has branches located in the states of california  texas  new jersey and new york 
federal home loan bank system the federal home loan bank system  or the fhlb  of which the bank is a member  consists of regional fhlbs governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board  or the fhfb 
the fhlbs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
they make loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the boards of directors of each regional fhlb 
as a system member  the bank is entitled to borrow from the fhlb of san francisco  or fhlb sf  and is required to own capital stock in the fhlb sf in an amount equal to the greater of of the membership asset value  not exceeding million  or of outstanding fhlb sf advance borrowings 
the bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules described above with respect to such advances  commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb sf to the bank are secured by a portion of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb sf held by the bank 
mortgage banking operations the bank is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma with respect to originating  processing  selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities 
those rules and regulations  among other things  prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals  require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts 
mortgage origination activities are subject to  among others  the equal credit opportunity act  federal truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which  among other things  prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs 
the bank is also subject to regulation by the california department of financial institutions  with respect to  among other things  the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products 
future legislation and economic policy we cannot predict what other legislation or economic and monetary policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof 
future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid from time and savings deposits 
such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue 
item a 
risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties are discussed elsewhere in this report  and there may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
if a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans  our business  profitability  and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as a lender  the largest risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due 
if borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses  it could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  and financial condition 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
increases in our allowance for loan losses could materially affect our earnings adversely 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non performance 
our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio 
however  actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which are generally beyond our control 
thus  such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely 
in addition  the fdic and the dfi  as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs  based upon judgments different from those of management 
any increase in our allowance required by the fdic or the dfi could adversely affect us 
banking organizations are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
a major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets  such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
on september  and in the months following that date  the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates  which are used to guide deposit pricing in most banking organizations  were decreased 
specifically  as a measure to counter the credit crisis  the federal reserve board reduced the federal funds rate in september  october and december  by   and basis points  respectively 
the reductions in the federal funds rate effectively lowered the average interest rate for  which resulted in similar average yield rates compared to the interest rate ranges for and were and  respectively 
on january  and on january   the federal reserve board further reduced the federal funds rate by and basis points  respectively 
more reductions are anticipated in the upcoming months 
the recent downward trend of interest rates is the counter to the upward interest rate movement since june  while the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates decreased substantially  the intermediate and long term market interest rates  which are used by many banking organizations to guide loan pricing  have not decreased proportionately 
this has led to a steepening of the market yield curve with statement term rates considerably lower than long term notes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to minimize our interest rate risk 
in addition  while a decrease in the general level of interest rates may improve the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations  it reduces our interest income  and may lead to an increase in competition among banks for deposits 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  net interest margin and our overall profitability 
the profitability of wilshire bancorp will be dependent on the profitability of the bank 
because wilshire bancorp s principal activity is to act as the holding company of the bank  the profitability of wilshire bancorp will be dependent on the profitability of the bank 
the bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment  competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the bank  in addition to other independent banks 
in addition  the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by government monetary and fiscal policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international terrorism and other disorders as well as other factors beyond the control of the bank may adversely affect its profitability 
banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision  regulation and control  and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the bank 
wilshire bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the bank 
the bank is the only source of significant income for wilshire bancorp 
accordingly  the ability of wilshire bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends depends on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to it 
however  the bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends that it may pay to wilshire bancorp 
for example  any payment of dividends by the bank is subject to the fdic s capital adequacy guidelines 
all banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and a ratio of tier capital to average adjusted assets of 
if i the fdic increases any of these required ratios  ii the total of risk weighted assets of the bank increases significantly  and or iii the bank s income decreases significantly  the bank s board of directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the bank s earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios 
this will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the bank to wilshire bancorp 
further  in some cases  the fdic could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the bank from paying dividends if  in its view  such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices 
in addition  whether dividends are paid and their frequency and amount will depend on the financial condition and performance  and the discretion of the board of directors of the bank 
the foregoing restrictions on dividends paid by the bank may limit wilshire bancorp s ability to obtain funds from such dividends for its cash needs  including funds for payment of its debt service requirements and operating expenses and for payment of cash dividends to wilshire bancorp s shareholders 
the amount of dividends the bank could pay to wilshire bancorp as of december  without prior regulatory approval  which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years  was million 
the holders of recently issued debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders 
in december  the bank issued an aggregate of million of junior subordinated debentures  sometimes referred to in this report as the junior subordinated debentures or the debentures 
in addition  in the past three years  wilshire bancorp  as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued an aggregate of  of junior subordinated debentures as part of the issuance of  in trust preferred securities by statutory trusts wholly owned by wilshire bancorp 
the purpose of these transactions was to raise additional capital 
these junior subordinated debentures are senior in liquidation rights to our outstanding shares of common stock 
the terms of these junior subordinated debentures also restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at any time we are in default under  or with respect to the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or  have exercised our right to defer interest payments under the indentures governing these junior subordinated debentures 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of these junior subordinated debentures must be paid in full before any liquidating distributions may be made to the holders of our common stock 
and if we default under the terms of these junior subordinated debentures or utilize our right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid 
because we are substantially dependent on dividends from the bank in order to make the periodic payments due under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures issued in  and  in the event that the bank is unable to pay dividends to wilshire bancorp for any significant period of time  then we may be unable to pay the amounts due to the holders of these junior subordinated debentures 
adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions  especially in california  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  and profitability 
if conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy  especially in california  our business  growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected 
a substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in california  and adverse economic conditions in california  particularly in the los angeles area  could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients 
to the extent that our clients underlying businesses are harmed  they are more likely to default on their loans 
we can provide no assurance that conditions in the california economy and in the economies of other areas where we operate will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect us 
recently negative development in the financial industry and us and global credit markets may affect our operations and results 
negative developments in the latter half of in the subprime mortgage market and the securitization markets for such loans have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets generally and the expectation of a general economic downtown beginning in commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively affect our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely affect our financial performance 
our operations may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient to offset any problem assets 
however  should our asset quality erode and require significant additional provision  resulting in consistent net operating losses at the bank  our capital levels will decline and we will need to raise capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel ii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for non basel ii us banks is uncertain 
as a result of the recent deterioration in the global credit markets and the potential impact of increased liquidity risk and interest rate risk  it is unclear what the short term impact of the implementation basel ii may be or what impact a pending alternative standardized approach to basel ii option for non basel ii us banks may have on the cost and availability of different types of credit and the potential compliance costs of implementing the new capital standards 
maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services 
a failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce  or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand  could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  or growth prospects 
significant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the california real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate 
at december   approximately of our loans were secured by real estate  a substantial portion of which consist of loans secured by real estate in california 
conditions in the california real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non performing assets 
a real estate recession in southern california could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  california has experienced  on occasion  significant natural disasters  including earthquakes  brush fires and  during early and late  flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as el nino 
in addition to these catastrophes  california has experienced a moderate decline in housing prices beginning in late the decline in housing prices subsequently developed into the current credit crisis  characterized by the further decline in the real estate market in many parts of the country  including california  during the second half of the availability of insurance to compensate for losses resulting from such crises is limited 
the occurrence of one or more of such crises could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us 
if we fail to retain our key employees  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel 
if we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time  we could be adversely affected 
our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such employees among financial institutions in california is intense 
our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to retain any of our key officers and employees or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
in november  brian e 
cho  our former executive vice president and chief financial officer  resigned 
following his resignation  elaine s 
jeon  senior vice president and controller  was promoted to senior vice president and interim chief financial officer as mr 
cho s replacement 
in addition  effective january   our former president and chief executive officer  soo bong min  retired 
however  in connection with his retirement  we have entered into a consulting agreement providing for mr 
min s continued service as an advisor for the bank until may following mr 
min s retirement  joanne kim  previously our executive vice president and chief lending officer  was promoted to interim president and chief executive officer 
we may be unable to manage future growth 
we may encounter problems in managing our future growth 
our total assets at december    and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or in and million  or in we currently intend to consider additional de novo branches and lpos and to investigate opportunities to acquire or combine with other financial institutions that would complement our existing business  as such opportunities may arise and consistent with our deliberate expansion strategy 
no assurance can be provided  however  that we will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or consummate any such acquisition 
further  our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings and control costs 
any failure by us to accomplish these goals could result in interruptions in our business plans and could also adversely affect current operations 
we could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services 
fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services 
we offer various internet based services to our clients  including online banking services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients confidence in our online services 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security  failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business 
people generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our ability to provide financial services over the internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online 
as a result  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   our directors and executive officers  together with their respective affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting common stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  such shareholders may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
we can provide no assurance that the investment objectives of such shareholders will be the same as our other shareholders 
the market for our common stock is limited  and potentially subject to volatile changes in price 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors  including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors  or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates  conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular  or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry 
in addition  the equity markets have  on occasion  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
in addition  the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
further  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
we face substantial competition in our primary market area 
we conduct our banking operations primarily in southern california 
increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including without limitation  savings and loan institutions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits  and range and quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
we also face competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened low end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas 
if we are unable to attract and retain banking customers  we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares  thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management  including the current board of directors  to retain its position  and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business 
the anti takeover measures included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  include  without limitation  the following the elimination of cumulative voting  the adoption of a classified board of directors  super majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws  and restrictions on certain business combinations with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us 
we are subject to significant government regulation and legislation that increases the cost of doing business and inhibits our ability to compete 
we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation  all of which is subject to material change from time to time 
these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete efficiently with other financial service providers that are not similarly regulated 
changes in regulatory policies or procedures could result in management s determining that a higher provision for loan losses would be necessary and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net earnings 
there can be no assurance that future regulation or legislation will not impose additional requirements and restrictions on us in a manner that could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and prospects 
we could be negatively impacted by downturns in the south korean economy 
many of our customers are locally based korean americans who also conduct business in south korea 
although we conduct most of our business with locally based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements  we have historically had some exposure to the economy of south korea in connection with certain of our loans and credit transactions with korean banks 
such exposure has consisted of discounts of acceptances created by banks in south korea  advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  and extensions of credit to borrowers in the us secured by letters of credit issued by banks in south korea 
we generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements  in excess of  and of longer than days  only with the largest of the korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium sized korean banks 
due to the economic crisis in south korea in the mid s  management has continued to closely monitor our exposure to the korean economy and the activities of korean banks with which we conduct business 
to date  we have not experienced any significant losses attributable to our exposure to south korea 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the korean economy will be successful in the future  and another significant downturn in the korean economy could result in significant credit losses for us 
in addition  because our customer base is largely korean american  our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of a deterioration of the korean economy 
for example  some of our customers businesses may rely on funds from south korea 
further  our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates  and or to help their relatives in south korea during downturns in the korean economy 
a significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect 
shares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding  plus an additional  shares of common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the wilshire state bank stock option plan  or the stock option plan 
thus  approximately  shares of our common stock remain authorized not reserved for stock options or available for future issuance and sale at the discretion of our board of directors 
shares of our preferred stock issued in the future could have dilutive and other effects 
shares of our preferred stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for the shares of our common stock 
in addition to  shares of common stock  our articles of incorporation of the company authorize the issuance of  shares of preferred stock 
although our board of directors has no present intent to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock  such shares could be authorized in the future 
if such shares of preferred stock are made convertible into shares of common stock  there could be a dilutive effect on the shares of common stock then outstanding 
in addition  shares of preferred stock may be provided a preference over holders of common stock upon our liquidation or with respect to the payment of dividends  in respect of voting rights or in the redemption of our capital stock 
the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions applicable to any series of preferred stock may be determined by resolution of our board of directors without the need for shareholder approval

dividends as a california corporation  we are restricted under the california general corporation law  or cgcl  from paying dividends under certain conditions 
our shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends  as provided in the cgcl 
the cgcl provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout at least equal the amount of proposed distribution 
in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may  nevertheless  make a distribution  if it meets both the quantitative solvency and the liquidity tests 
in general  the quantitative solvency test requires that the sum of the assets of the corporation equal at least times its liabilities 
the liquidity test generally requires that a corporation have current assets at least equal to current liabilities  or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for such fiscal years  then current assets must be equal to at least times current liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to make capital distributions to our shareholders 
it has been our general practice to retain earnings for the purpose of increasing capital to support growth  and no cash dividends were paid to shareholders prior to however  we began paying a cash dividend to our shareholders beginning with the first quarter of while we currently pay cash dividends  dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  cash needs and general business conditions 
any dividend must also comply with the restrictions in our outstanding junior subordinated debentures described earlier in this report as well as applicable bank regulations 
our ability to pay cash dividends in the future will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its capital stock to us 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the california financial code  the fdia and fdic regulations 
in general terms  california law provides that the bank may declare a cash dividend out of net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or  with the prior written approval of the commissioner of department of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings  net income for the prior fiscal year  or net income for the current fiscal year 
the bank s ability to pay any cash dividends will depend not only upon our earnings during a specified period  but also on our meeting certain capital requirements 
the fdia and fdic regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized  when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments  or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank 
the payment of dividends by the bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies  such as maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate community banks in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business by focusing on the continued development of our commercial and consumer lending divisions 
in may  we completed the acquisition of liberty bank of new york liberty and its merger into the bank 
with this acquisition  we added million in total assets and two branches in new york city 
we paid million for this transaction  which consisted of million in cash and million in our common stock  shares 
we also incurred merger related costs of  which we recognized as additional consideration in connection with this business combination 
in july  we acquired a branch of royal bank america rba in fort lee  new jersey in exchange for our branch at flushing  new york 
in this branch exchange transaction  we purchased selected fixed assets and assumed selected liabilities  including a portion of rba s time deposits 
as consideration  we transferred to rba selected intangible and fixed assets  and selected liabilities  including a portion of time deposits  intangible liabilities  and lease obligations 
the amounts involved in this transaction were insignificant except for the time deposits exchanged 
in the branch exchange transaction  both parties transferred deposit liabilities in the amount of approximately million 
the branch exchange transaction was accounted for as an exchange of assets and liabilities 
the fort lee  new jersey loan portfolio has grown in the six months since its acquisition  from million to million at the end of deposit growth at the fort lee branch has also exceeded our expectation  increasing from at the time of the branch exchange to million at the end of subsequent to the branch exchange in july  we opened a new bayside branch in new york to compensate for the loss of our flushing branch 
the above described transactions resulted in an expansion of our banking service and market coverage to the state of new jersey and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
similar to the new jersey branch  the loan portfolio of our two new york branches has grown since the acquisition  from million to million at the end of deposit portfolio has also experienced significant growth  up from million at the time of the acquisition to million at the end of in addition to our expansion into the new york new jersey area  we further expanded our banking network within the state of california 
in december  we opened a new branch office  rancho hannam in rancho cucamonga  california 
over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has been expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty branch offices and six lpos 
our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue our growth via thorough planning and market analysis  and as our needs and resources permit 
in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these debentures allowed us to achieve and maintain status as a well capitalized institution and sustained our continued loan growth 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
our management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio and enhanced shareholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for operations during our total assets grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits slightly grew to billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of our total loans grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of total noninterest income decreased to million in  or a decrease of from million in mainly due to the reduction of volume and premium rate on sale of sba loans under the weak national economy  attributable primarily to the credit crisis 
total noninterest expense increased to million in  or from million in the increase is mainly due to the increase in the fdic deposit insurance premium  and expense related to expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth 
nonetheless  due to our continuous effort in minimizing operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in net income for decreased to million  or per diluted common share as compared with million  or per diluted common share in the decrease in net income is primarily attributed to the change of management strategy and shifting our efforts and focus of the management from promoting profit growth to improving loan portfolio quality 
we will discuss these changes in further detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook as we look ahead to  the economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and thus our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the decrease in housing prices starting late  and the emergence of the credit crisis in mid  the real estate market and our overall economy are generally declining 
growth in the national economy slowed during  and we anticipate a further decline in as measures to stimulate the economy  the federal reserve board has aggressively cut interest rates  by and basis points on january  and january   respectively  to boost spending and ease the shorting pressure of the market 
the deterioration of our economy will negatively affect our asset quality 
responding proactively to this anticipated business environment  we are shifting our focus from growth to improvement of our asset quality 
since  we have strengthened loan underwriting standards and are carefully scrutinizing any exceptions to our loan policy 
we anticipate these changes will result in loan growth that is slower than our historic levels  but we also anticipate a resulting improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio 
we plan to continue to focus on management of our net interest margin 
we are slightly asset sensitive for the first three month time frame  meaning that more interest earning assets will reprice than interest bearing liabilities for the first quarter of however  we should begin to see improvements by the second quarter of as we are more liability sensitive in the long term as interest bearing liabilities will re price more quickly than interest earning assets 
the interest repricing gap in our models indicate that our margin generally increases in a declining interest rate environment  nonetheless  we do not anticipate a major increase in our net interest margin because it is our expectation that the strategic change toward more moderate and quality loan growth will reduce the volume of our higher yielding  higher risk loans 
although we did not have any subprime borrowers in our current loan portfolio  it is our belief that a more stringent lending strategy is to our benefit in managing loan losses under this credit crisis 
as a result  our net interest margin should experience only moderate growth 
to complement these strategic changes  explore new business opportunities and reduce costs  we plan to extend our market coverage into the east coast of the united states 
we also plan to continue our core deposit campaign that links monetary awards to core deposit growth 
we expect that these measures will benefit our net interest margin going forward 
notwithstanding the overall slower national economy  we believe that there will be continued economic growth in our primary market areas  which includes the korean american business sectors located in southern california  texas  new jersey  and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
we expect that this growth will be mainly attributable to an anticipated capital influx from the republic of korea 
we therefore believe that we will continue to grow  provided that such growth will be at a more controlled pace than we have experienced in the past few years 
the reduction in our growth rate is expected to result in a healthier balance sheet  as we expect to see less non performing loans 
hence  our asset base is expected to be of better quality with more core deposits 
we will continue to consider opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching and regional lpos 
we are currently in the planning process of opening our second new jersey branch in palisades park during the third quarter of  and a new branch in los angeles  california during the second quarter of we believe the second new jersey branch  together with the existing fort lee  new jersey branch and the new york branches  will be a critical part of our planned expansion strategy  especially in the east coast market of the united states due to its high level of small business activity and diverse population 
in addition  we will continue to focus on streamlining our operations so that our expenses do not outpace the overall growth of our business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of small business administration loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimates necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with sfas no 
we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors detailed below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if there exists information to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio 
the factors currently considered include  but are not limited to  those described below 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each factor 
concentration of credits this factor may be adjusted based on the identification of any concentration or significant changes to the level of identified concentrations of credit 
a concentration of credit is defined as loans to any single borrower  affiliated group of borrowers  or borrowers engaged in or dependent upon one industry that exceeds of tier capital reserves 
a concentration can also result from an acquisition of a volume of loans from a single source  regardless of the diversity of the individual borrowers 
delinquency trends the trend of delinquency shall be assessed by the quarterly trend and by comparison with peer average 
nature and volume of loan trend this factor will be adjusted for significant changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 
non accrual loan trend the trend of non accrual loans shall be assessed by the quarterly trend and by comparison with peer average 
problem loan trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the quarterly trend of criticized and classified loans in total loans 
loss and recovery trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the quarterly trend of net charge offs and by comparison with peers 
quality of loan review this factor may be adjusted when there has been a noted and significant as determined and documented from external or internal sources deterioration or improvement in the loan review system and or bank director s oversight 
an adjustment will generally occur when there had previously been a documented weakness and clear improvement was noted by external sources  or when a significant deterioration was noted by external sources  in the loan review system and or the degree of oversight by the bank directors 
in the absence of noted changes to the loan review system and or the degree of oversight by the bank directors  no adjustment will be made 
lending and management staff this factor will be adjusted with changes to the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff that are significant enough to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratio 
if the staffing or the experience level of lending staff is considered to be adequate as determined by an external source then  in general  no adjustment will be made 
lending policies and procedures this factor may be adjusted depending on the documented results of external reviews of the policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
the trend of policy or procedure exceptions will also have an impact on this factor 
it is the objective of the board of directors and management to maintain at all times adequate policies  procedures  underwriting standards  and practices 
economic and business conditions this factor may be adjusted depending on local  regional  and national economic trends and their perceived impact on particular market segments 
in periods of stable economic environment  no adjustment will be made 
external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio this factor may be adjusted depending on the trend of external factors and their perceived impact on the overall credit risk 
in periods of stable regulatory environment  no adjustment will be made 
other adjustments with a supporting rationale  this factor may be used for adjustments which cannot be addressed by the foregoing factors 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loan among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  and selected a fair value measurement method to measure our servicing assets and liabilities and recognized the net increase in their fair value of  net of tax effects 
any subsequent increase or decrease in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
i o strips are amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield and monitored for impairment 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
goodwill we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york see note 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will no longer be amortized  but rather be subject to impairment testing at least annually 
in addition  recognized intangible assets are amortized to expense over the projected useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we tested goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as of december  there was no impairment in recorded goodwill and intangible assets as of december  see notes and 
affordable housing investments the company has invested in limited partnerships formed to develop and operate affordable housing units for lower income tenants throughout the states of california  texas and new york 
the costs of the investments are being amortized on a straight line method over the life of related tax credits 
if the partnerships cease to qualify during the compliance period  the credits may be denied for any period in which the projects are not in compliance and a portion of the credits previously taken is subject to recapture with interest 
such investments are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
repurchase of common stock the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program on july  for repurchases of up to million outstanding common shares by july  management was granted discretion on the purchase decisions under the general guidelines of the program 
the company used the cost method of accounting for treasury stock 
the cost method requires it to record the reacquisition cost of treasury stock as a deduction from shareholders equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
stock based compensation the company issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers  and directors 
prior to december   the company accounted for its fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method  presented in accounting principles board apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations  which generally does not result in compensation expense recognition 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost for stock options is measured at the date of grant as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock over the exercise price of the options 
on january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment  for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the company follows the modified prospective method  which requires application of the new statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of january  are recognized as the requisite services are rendered on or after january  the compensation cost of that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
currently  all of our investment securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income  as part of shareholders equity 
in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored enterprises gse bonds  collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  and mortgage backed securities mbs are attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa 
the company has no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities abs and collateralized debt obligations cdos that had previously been rated aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
the company has the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing risk in the market 
the company has the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods and average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits also increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing in from million in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing by in from billion in the federal reserve board s rate increases since june resulted in an increase in our average yield on interest earning assets to in from in however  in response to the credit crisis  the federal reserve board started its new series of interest rate reductions in september accordingly  our yield slightly decreased to in during the same time periods  the stiff competition for deposits in our local markets accelerated  causing our average cost on interest bearing liabilities to increase to in and to in from in as a result  interest income grew to million in compared to million in the growth in interest income  however  was outpaced by a increase in interest expense to million in from million in the increase of interest income in was which was similarly outpaced by increase in interest expense 
the net result of our growth and reduction in interest rate was a net increase our interest income 
net interest income increased by  or million  to million in  following an increase of  or million in to million from million in impacted by the federal reserve board s rate cuts and the stiff deposit competition among financial institutions  our net interest spread and net interest margin deteriorated in to and  respectively  lowered from and in  and and in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our average balances of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  in addition to the major components of net interest income and net interest margin distribution  yield and rate analysis of net income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  average balance interest income expense average rate yield average balance interest income expense average rate yield average balance interest income expense average rate yield dollars in thousands assets earning assets net loans securities of government sponsored enterprises other investment securities commercial paper federal funds sold money market preferred stocks interest earning deposits total interest earning assets total noninterest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities money market deposits super now deposits savings deposits time certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more other time deposits fhlb advances and other borrowings junior subordinated debenture total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities total noninterest bearing liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin net loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income

net loan fees were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but include those placed on non accrual status 
provision for loan losses in anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business and the recent ongoing credit crisis  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not made only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
although we have enhanced our stringent loan underwriting standard and proactive credit follow up procedures  we experienced a substantial increase of the provision for loan losses because of the weak economy  the decline in real estate market  and the unprecedented nationwide increase in subprime loan defaults and foreclosures 
with our moderate loan growth  our provision for loan losses increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  to keep pace with the continued growth of our loan portfolio and an increase of non performing loans see nonperforming assets below for further discussion 
the said provision for loan losses included the amount we provided for the credit risk of off balance sheet items   and  in  and  respectively 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses below 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased to million in as compared with million in  but increased from million in noninterest income was of average assets in  lowered from in and we currently earn non interest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of loans loan related servicing income income from other earning assets other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was service charge income on deposit accounts  representing over of total noninterest income 
this revenue source generally increases in accordance with an increase in the number of transactional accounts and increased by in to million from million in since  more rigid monitoring procedures were imposed on the money service business  or msb  accounts 
hence  the volume of transactions and service fee income from the msb accounts were reduced  which limited the increase in such revenue source 
however  we have been seeing an increase in transactional accounts in the past couple of years  which resulted in the revenue increase in this category 
nonetheless  the service revenue increase was in  as compared to increase in from million in we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive position 
our second largest source of noninterest income was the gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of total noninterest income in it decreased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
this noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in government securities secondary markets and retain servicing rights 
sba loan production levels decreased to million in as compared with million and million in  and  respectively  and accordingly the gain on sale of the guaranteed portions of sba loans decreased to million in as compared with million in and million in the million decrease in gain of guaranteed portion of sba loan sales in was primarily attributed to the sales decrease in premium rates from in to in we also sell the unguaranteed portion of sba loans  but the resulting gains are not considered a stable source of income since the unguaranteed portion is sold primarily for credit risk management purposes 
the gain on sale of the unguaranteed portions of sba loans was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
similar to the guaranteed portion loan sales  the million decreases in gain of unguaranteed portion of sba loan sales in were primarily attributed to the decrease in sales premium rates from in to in this source of noninterest income also includes sales gains on residential mortgage loans 
since the inception of our home loan center in the fourth quarter of  the sale of residential mortgage loans have become a stable noninterest income source  but gain on such sales decreased to  in  as compared with  and  in and  respectively  due to the decline of the residential mortgage market 
the loan related servicing income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
significant reversals of servicing assets on sold loans  which were paid off before their maturities  lowered this income source to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the servicing fees on sold sba loans are credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing  and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing assets that we previously capitalized as intangible servicing assets and interest only strip receivables upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing assets are also reversed and charged against the fee income account when the sold loans are paid off before the related servicing assets are fully amortized 
in  million of servicing assets was charged back to this income account and reduced the balance by early pay offs as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
in light of our increasing emphasis on trade financing activities and the continuing growth of our servicing loan portfolio million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively  management believes that this income source should continue to improve despite the weak economy and the ongoing credit crisis 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
income on other earning assets represents income from earning assets other than interest earning assets  such as dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in cash surrender value of boli 
such income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million change in was primarily due to  increase in boli interest income  and  increase in fhlb dividend income 
similarly in  the million increase in income was also primarily attributable to an additional boli interest and fhlb stock dividend 
other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as loan referral fee  sba loan packaging fee  gain on sale of investment securities and excess of insurance proceeds over carrying value of an insured loss and generally increases as our business grows 
other income increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was mainly attributed to million increase in fair market value of the sba servicing asset 
the increase in other income in was also roughly million  which has been consistent and reasonable 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in these increases can be attributed to the expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth  including the recent opening of new offices 
however  due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets was stable at in and  respectively  lowered from in management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have effectively maintained our operational efficiency at comparatively low levels in the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income 
despite the weak economic condition  our efficiency ratio has only slightly increased to in from in and in the following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated noninterest expense dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment data processing loan referral fee professional fees directors fees office supplies investor relation expenses advertising and promotional communications deposit insurance premium outsourced service for customers amortization of intangibles other total average assets noninterest expense as a of average assets salaries and employee benefits historically represent more than half of total noninterest expense and generally increase as our branch network and business volume expand 
the new branch and loan production office openings increased these expenses to million in as compared with million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
despite our efforts to promote efficient operations by limiting personnel growth  the number of full time equivalent employees increased to in december  as compared with and in and  respectively 
the million increase in over was mainly caused by our further east coast expansion via opening of the bayside branch in new york 
we have attempted to control the expense in this category  such that the percentage increase in was minimized 
our significant asset growth helped us maintain assets per employee at stable values  with million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
occupancy and equipment expenses represent approximately to of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our office network and the additional office space and lease expenses for new departments 
the increases in was less significant as we had only one office opening in the new york new jersey area  compared to the two branch additions in data processing expenses increased to million in from million in  which previously increased from million in the increase in data processing corresponds to the growth of our business 
loan referral fees are paid to brokers who refer loans to us  mostly sba loans 
although we also pay referral fees for some qualified commercial loans  referral fee expenses generally correspond to our sba loan production level 
sba loan production decreased to million in  from million in  which previously increased from million in accordingly  the referral fees decreased to million in  from million in  which previously increased from million in professional fees generally increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures will continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we expand our business operations 
professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
the increase in professional fees is mainly attributable to the legal and accounting fees incurred for various legal consultation and to comply with the enhanced financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox 
advertising and promotional expenses decreased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in the new areas such as texas  new jersey and new york 
the expenses in the past two years are higher than in  which was primarily attributable to our expansion into the east coast 
however  the expenses slightly decreased as compared to  which was due to our effort to limit expenses 
outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due to the growth and expansion of our banking network  these expenses have increased to million in from million in  due to increase in depositors demanding such services  such as escrow accounts and brokerage accounts 
in  these expenses slightly decreased from million in due to a minor reduction of such services 
deposit insurance premium expenses represent the financing corporation fico and fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  the expenses sharply increased to million from million in  which was primarily attributable to the million increase in fdic risk insurance premium assessment see related discussion in item  business 
prior to  only fico premium was assessed  the bank paid no fdic deposit insurance assessment 
hence  the expenses in this category stayed consistent between and at million 
investor relations expenses represent costs for providing services to our existing or prospective shareholders  such as nasdaq listing fees  fees for an outside investor relations company and various promotional material costs 
these expenses increased slightly to  as compared with  in  primarily due to the expanded activities 
in  these expenses sharply decreased from  in because the nasdaq listing fees were paid in for additional shares issued in connection with the december stock split 
noninterest expense  other than the categories specifically addressed above  increased by million  or  to million in from million in in  noninterest expenses increased by million  or  from million in such increases represent the normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and appear in line with our expectation 
generally  noninterest expense increased less rapidly at in compared to in this was primarily due to the slowing of our economy  and that our successful expansion into the new york new jersey market in has paved the groundwork for our further expansion into the east coast in and beyond 
hence  we did not see the same level of increase in expenses in nonetheless  management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow 
however  management remains committed to cost control and operational efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we made a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate in stayed at about the same level as however  the effective tax rate in was slightly higher than by  due mainly to the effect of a change in the estimated tax provision 
we filed our income tax returns in the third quarter of and the actual income tax liability on the return was approximately  less than the provision we estimated in  resulting in a reversal of tax payable in our effective tax rates are usually one to two percentage points lower than statutory rates due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and the tax preferential treatment for the bank owned life insurance and low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense accounts for the change in deferred tax assets liabilities from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in the financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of applying the provisions of fin  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit and related interest of  as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit was  the adjustment was solely related to the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions 
we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
as of the december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions  net of united states federal tax benefit  was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes 
accrued interest was included as part of our net deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements 
we file united states federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statue of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition see note 
financial condition loan portfolio total loans are the sum of loans receivable and loans held for sale and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income which is unamortized deferred fees and costs and premiums and discounts 
total loans net of unearned income increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  total loans net of unearned income were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
total loans net of unearned income as a percentage of total assets were     and for     and respectively 
in the ordinary course of our business  we originate and service our own loans 
for salable loans that we choose to sell in the secondary market  we sell them with representations and warranties generally consistent with industry practices  but without recourse 
the exception is sba loans  which is our practice to resell these loans in the secondary market for the guaranteed portion with day recourse 
hence  we do not retain much of the credit risk exposure on the loans sold 
and  for all loans we originate and carry  we have not had any subprime loans 
real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon 
the properties may be either user owned or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines set forth by the fdic 
the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  fair review of appraisal value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
loans secured by real estate equaled billion  billion  billion  billion  and billion  as of december     and  respectively 
real estate secured loans as a percentage of total loans were     and at december     and  respectively 
due to the decline of the real estate market nation wide and our target marketing efforts for unsecured business and commercial loans  the composition of real estate secured loans have decreased in and compared to the prior years  and we believe there will be further decreases going forward 
we offer a wide selection of residential mortgage programs  including non traditional mortgages such as interest only and payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we are extremely cautious at offering such unconventional loans to our customers  and currently we carried no subprime loans in our portfolio 
most of our salable loans are transferred to the secondary market while we retain a portion on our books as portfolio loans 
this secondary market has become less active compared to the prior years  as the real estate market generally declines and a few key players in the market experience financial difficulties due to the credit crisis 
our total home mortgage loan portfolio outstanding at the end of and were million and million  respectively  and they represented only a small fraction of our total loan portfolio at in and in we have deemed its effect on our credit risk profile to be immaterial 
the residential mortgage loans with unconventional terms such as interest only mortgage and option adjustable rate mortgage at december  were million and million  respectively  inclusive of loans held temporarily for sale or refinancing 
they were million and million  respectively  at december  commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit  as well as term business loans 
commercial and industrial loans were million  million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
commercial and industrial loans were     and as a percentage of total loans at the end of    and  respectively 
such increases in recent years were mainly caused by our marketing strategy targeted for the relationship based accounts  such as unsecured business and commercial loans 
under the current economic condition  we exercise more due diligence in acquiring new loans 
hence  we expect to see our loan portfolio to continue growing  but at a more controlled pace 
consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in automobile loans  which we provide as a service only to existing customers 
the balance of consumer loans have increased in the recent three years compared to prior years  they are million  million  million  million  and million  at december     and  respectively 
however  as consumer loans present a higher risk potential compared to our loan products  especially during the current economic condition  we have reduced our effort in consumer lending in hence  as of december   our consumer loan total was down million from the prior year level 
nonetheless  consumer loans as a percentage of total loans have always been minimal 
we do not see these loans  especially automobile loans  as our area of strength 
unlike other loan productions  management does not anticipate consumer loans to increase significantly going forward 
construction loans are generally extended as a temporary financing vehicle only 
in the third quarter of  we formed a construction loan department by appointing a construction loan specialist as its manager 
since then  construction loans increased to million  million and million  respectively at the end of  and  as compared with million  and million  respectively  at the end of and construction loans as a percentage of total loans also increased to at the end of from and in prior years 
we expect to expand our construction lending activities with this specialized capacity under the guidance of the commercial loan center 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans have typical maturities of three to five years and are extended to finance the purchase of business entities  business equipment  and leasehold improvements  or to provide permanent working capital 
sba guaranteed loans usually have longer maturities to years 
we generally limit real estate loan maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
we generally seek diversification in our loan portfolio  and our borrowers are diverse as to industry  location  and their current and target markets 
the following table sets forth the amount of total loans net of unearned income and the percentage distributions in each category  as of the dates indicated distribution of loans and percentage composition of loan portfolio amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans net of unearned income participation loans sold and serviced by the company construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans net of unearned income the following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio as of december  in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates 
the amounts on the table below are the gross loan balances at december  before netting unearned income totaling million and the gross amount of non accrual loans of million is not included loan maturities and repricing schedule at december   within one year after one but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans loans with variable floating interest rates loans with predetermined fixed interest rates the majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in southern california 
the loans generated by our loan production offices  which are located outside of our main geographical market  are generally collateralized by property in close proximity to those offices 
we employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas 
since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california and around the country have generally increased in the last year span from to since late  we have started to see below trend growth in gdp and a slowdown of the real estate market in southern california and many other areas in the country 
following the emergence of the credit crisis around july  the real estate market has generally declined throughout the country 
nonetheless  as of year end  of our loans are secured by first mortgages on various types of real estate with weighted average loan to value ratio of 
we expect to see this decline in real estate values to continue into  so with the current economic conditions  no assurance can be given that property values will not significantly decrease further in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans restructured  where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  and other nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they become days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
the past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status  causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
other nonperforming assets  mainly other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed vehicles  consist of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
despite the significant growth of our loan portfolio  our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of nonperforming loans prior to however  the general economic condition of the united states as well as the local economies in which we do business has shown a slowdown as the housing sector declined in and the transition to below trend gdp growth has started 
this transition of the economy affected our borrowers strength and our nonperforming loans  net of sba guaranteed portion  increased to million at the end of  as compared with million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
at december   the nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was  increased from   and in   and  respectively 
at december   we had  as other nonperforming assets  the majority of which were represented by one oreo  foreclosed in october we have listed the property for sale as of december  at the end of  we had a different oreo  which was subsequently sold in january at a small loss 
at the end of  we had three oreo as other nonperforming assets in an amount of  which were subsequently sold without significant losses 
we had no other nonperforming assets at the end of and  at the end of  our only nonperforming asset was a single family residence in an amount of  which was subsequently sold without a significant loss 
together with oreo and repossessed vehicles  we managed the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets at a relatively low level for the past five years  equaling     and as of december     and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion 
except as disclosed above  as of december   management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms 
however  no assurance can be given that credit problems do not exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management

such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses above 
with the economic transition addressed in nonperforming assets above  the net charge offs in increased to million when the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a certain number of our clients  as compared with million  million  million  and million  respectively in   and the net charge offs in were mainly comprised of million commercial and industrial loan charge offs  and million consumer loan charge offs

additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  in order to keep pace with the increase of nonperforming loans and our loan portfolio  we increased our allowance for loan losses by  or million  to million at december   as compared with million at december  such allowances were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
with the continued increase of the allowance for loan losses in recent years  we were able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at     and at the end of     and  respectively 
management believes that the current ratio of is in line with our peer group average and adequate for our loan portfolio because the level of total non performing loans as of december  was relatively low at of total loans 
although management believes the allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future

these commitments  which represent a credit risk to us  are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million  and million  respectively 
obligations under standby letters of credit were million  million  and million  for  and  respectively  and the obligations under commercial letters of credit were million  million  and million for the same periods 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various legal claims 
we have reviewed all legal claims against us with counsel and have taken into consideration the views of counsel as to the outcome of the claims 
in our opinion  the final disposition of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
investment activities investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a written comprehensive investment policy addressing strategies  types and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested 
as of december    and  we had million  million and million  respectively  in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements 
we did not have any interest bearing deposit in other financial institutions as of december  and  as compared to million as of december  the million decrease in federal funds sold was primarily attributable to the million increase in investment securities  million increase in cash and due from other banks  with the rest of increase attributed to the increase in our loan balance 
hence  cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december  investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk 
as of december   our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of united states government agency securities  nearly of the entire investment portfolio 
our us government agency securities holdings are all prime conforming mortgage backed securities  or mbs s  and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmo s  guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc  or gnma 
gnmas are considered equivalent to us treasury securities  as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
our investment portfolio currently contains subprime mortgages 
besides the us government agency securities  we also have investment in corporate debt and municipal debt securities 
most of our corporate and municipal debt securities are triple a rated  with only million rated one class below the triple a rating  but are also considered investment grade 
we did not early adopt sfas no 
in  and in  we classified our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale 
investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas no 
adoption on the consolidated financial statements 
the fair market values of our held to maturity and available for sale securities were respectively million and million as of december  the following table summarizes the book value and market value and distribution of our investment securities as of the dates indicated investment securities portfolio dollars in thousands as of december  as of december  as of december  amortized cost market value amortized cost market value amortized cost market value held to maturity securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligations municipal securities available for sale securities of government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations corporate securities municipal securities total investment securities the following table summarizes the maturity and repricing schedule of our investment securities at their carrying values and their weighted average yields at december  investment maturities and repricing schedule dollars in thousands within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield held to maturity securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligations municipal securities available for sale securities of government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations corporate securities municipal securities total investment securities our investment securities holdings increased by million  or  to million at december   compared to holdings of million at december  holdings at december  were million 
total investment securities as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively  compared to at december  as of december   investment securities having a carrying value of million were pledged to secure certain deposits 
as of december   held to maturity securities  which are carried at their amortized costs  decreased to million from million and million at december  and  respectively 
available for sale securities  which are stated at their fair market values  increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our liquidity level using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds which are maintained mainly in the form of overnight investments 
the following tables show our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  at december  and  respectively dollars in thousands as of december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross unrealized unrealized unrealized description of securities fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities corporate securities municipal securities as of december  less than months months or longer total gross gross gross unrealized unrealized unrealized description of securities fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities of government sponsored enterprises collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities corporate securities municipal securities as of december   the total unrealized losses less than months old were  and total unrealized losses more than months old were  the aggregate related fair value of investments with unrealized losses less than months old was million at december   and those with unrealized losses more than months old were million 
as of december   the total unrealized losses less than months old were  and total unrealized losses more than months old were million 
the aggregate related fair value of investments with unrealized losses less than months old was million at december   and those with unrealized losses more than months old were million 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we have the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature  at which time we expect to receive full value for the securities 
as of december  and  we also had the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as available for sale for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost 
the unrealized losses were largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
the fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline 
we do not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality 
accordingly  as of december  and  we believe the impairments detailed in the table above were temporary  and no impairment loss has been realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
other earning assets for various business purposes  we make investments in earning assets other than the interest earning assets discussed above 
before  the only other earning assets held by us were insignificant amounts of federal home loan bank stock and the cash surrender value of the boli 
in an effort to provide additional benefits aimed at retaining key employees  while generating a tax exempt noninterest income stream  we purchased million in in boli from insurance carriers rated aa or above 
in  we purchased million more in boli from the same insurance carriers 
we are the owner and the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and recognize the increase of the cash surrender value of the policies as tax exempt other income 
in  we also invested in two low income housing tax credit funds lihtcf to promote our participation in cra activities 
we committed to invest  over two to three years  a total of million to two different lihtcf million in apollo california tax credit fund xxii  lp  and million in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund  lp 
in  in order to promote our cra activities in each of the assessment areas in dallas  new york  and los angeles  we also committed to invest additional million  million  and million in wnc institutional tax credit fund xxi  wnc institutional tax credit fund x new york series  and wnc institutional tax credit fund x california series  respectively 
in  we made million additional commitment to invest in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund iv lp 
we receive the returns on these investments  over the fifteen years following the said two to three year investment periods in the form of tax credits and tax deductions 
as a collateral for the fhlb borrowings  we are required by fhlb to invest in fhlb stocks 
in  our total additional investment in fhlb stocks was  and our total dividends received from our fhlb stock holdings were  therefore  the total asset value of the fhlb stock increased  to  as of year end from  million in the prior year 
the balances of other earning assets as of december  and december  were as follows dollars in thousands type balance as of december  balance as of december  boli lihtcf federal home loan bank stock deposits and other sources of funds deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
total deposits at december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively  representing a slight increase of million  or  in and million  or  in the average deposits for the years ended december   and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in  and of million  or  in the slow down in deposit growth was primarily due to the stiff competition among other banks in the community 
we expect our expansion into the new york new jersey area and more branch coverage within our primary market of southern california to offset the loss of deposit from competition 
in  we expect to see a moderate but higher deposit growth rate than after  our niche market depositor s preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts and we increased our reliance on time deposits to fund our loan growth 
pursuant to our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits over the average total deposits slightly decreased to in from in such percentage in was 
since late  we have continued to promote our core deposit campaign in order to achieve the assigned core deposit goals and reduce our level of time deposit reliance going forward 
the average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of  or more increased to in as compared with in  which previously increased from in see net interest income and net interest margin for further discussion

a number of clients carry deposit balances that were more than of our total deposits  but at both december   and  the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
in addition to our regular customer base  we also accept brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
we have increased these deposits to million at december  from million and million  at december  and  respectively  in order to improve our net interest margin 
most of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
since brokered deposits are a non core funding source  we will closely monitor their growth 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
since  we have increased borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility of the program and its reasonable cost 
see liquidity management below for the details on the fhlb borrowings program

the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with these new capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until september  an extension of the september  transition period under the proposed rule to come into compliance with the final rule s capital restrictions due to the transition period 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp counted million of the trust preferred securities as tier capital  and million as tier capital 
asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity management maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we rely on advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we limit our use to of our borrowing capacity  as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to million and million in federal funds with bank of the west and union bank of california  respectively 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios as of the dates specified for wilshire bancorp  inc and wilshire state bank regulatory adequately regulatory well actual ratios for the company as of wilshire bancorp  inc capitalized standards capitalized standards december  december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to adjusted average assets regulatory adequately regulatory well actual ratios for the bank as of wilshire state bank capitalized standards capitalized standards december  december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to adjusted average assets at december   total shareholders equity increased by million  after declaring cash dividends of million  to million from million at december  such additional capital was primarily derived from internally generated operating income 
in  total shareholders equity also grew by million from million at december   after declaring cash dividends of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million 
our equity also increased by the share based compensation and other comprehensive income 
as of december   for the regulatory capital ratio computation purpose  we considered the junior subordinated debentures of million  which consists of million issued by the bank and million issued by the company in connection with the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
at december   wilshire bancorp accounted for million of such securities as tier capital and million as tier capital 
as of december   with the issuance of july debentures  the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million  reducing the portion for tier capital to million 
for the bank level  only the million debenture issued by the bank in is treated as tier capital 
see deposits and other sources of funds for further discussion regarding the capital treatment of subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities 
repurchase of common stock to take advantage of the recent low market price of our common stock  the company s board of directors authorized a repurchase program in july to allow discretion of management decisions in purchasing our outstanding common stock from the open market 
pursuant to the stock repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors in july  management repurchased the company s outstanding common stock on various dates in august and november on cost basis as listed below period shares purchased total amount total recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  which requires an employer to recognize obligations associated with endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements that extend into the participant s post employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or based on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement 
eitf is effective as of the beginning of the entity s first fiscal year after december  we adopted eitf on january  using the later option  based on the future death benefit 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this adoption on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies when the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires or allows assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and therefore  does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstance 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm s length transaction between market participants in the markets where we conduct business 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices available in active markets and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency 
the level of the reliability of inputs utilized for fair value calculations drives the extent of disclosure requirements of the valuation methodologies used under the standard 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
the provisions of sfas no 
should be applied prospectively  except for certain financial instruments for which the standard should be applied retrospectively 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this adoption on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year after november  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this adoption on the consolidated financial statements 
at the june  eitf meeting  the sec staff announced revisions to eitf d related to the release of sfas no 
the sec staff announced that it will no longer accept liability classification for financial instruments that meet the conditions for temporary equity classification under asr  presentation in financial statements of redeemable preferred stocks and eitf d as a consequence  the fair value option under sfas no 
may not be applied to any financial instrument or host contract that qualifies as temporary equity 
registrants that do not choose retrospective application should apply the announcement prospectively to all affected instruments that are entered into  modified  or otherwise subject to remeasurement event in the registrant s first fiscal quarter beginning after september  we do not expect the adoption of eitf d to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations of the company 
in november  eitf issued eitf  accounting for sale of real estate subject to the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for sale of real estate  when the agreement includes a buy sell clause 
the task force reached a consensus that a buy sell clause in a sale of real estate that otherwise qualifies for partial sale accounting does not by itself constitute a form of continuing involvement that would preclude partial sale accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for sale of real estate 
however  continuing involvement could be present if the buy sell clause  in conjunction with other implicit and explicit terms of the arrangement  indicate that the seller has an obligation to repurchase the property  the terms of the transaction allow the buyer to compel the seller to repurchase the property  or the seller can compel the buyer to sell its interest in the property back to the seller 
the consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the consensus applies to new assessments made under sfas no 
after the consensus effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations of the company 
in november  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings  which superseded sab no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments 
sab no 
indicates that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in measuring fair value for all written loan fair value for all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings 
the bulletin retains the view of sab no 
about recording the internally developed intangible assets as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment 
sab no 
is effective for derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sab no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of operations of the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this new statement revises sfas no 
 which was issued june sfas no 
r changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in sfas no 
r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and non controlling interests in the acquiree at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the non controlling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be remeasured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense and additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at the acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires a non controlling interest or minority interest to be reported by all entities in the same way  which is as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires income attributable to the non controlling interest to be disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
furthermore  sfas no 
eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non controlling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those years 
early adoption is prohibited 
the provisions of sfas no 
should be applied prospectively  except for presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements should be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us by its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management alm committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  our alm committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we are currently in a liability sensitive position for the one year time frame  but we are slightly asset sensitive for the first three months of in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans and investments  decreases in interest rates would be expected to increase our net interest margin 
increases in interest rates would be expected to have the opposite effect 
however  we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
at december   our position appeared liability sensitive for a one year timeframe with a liability sensitive cumulative gap of minus of average interest earning assets 
we do not anticipate a major change in our net interest margin as we expect such repricing gap  if it occurred  to be eliminated within a year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alm committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alm policy prescribes that for the worst possible rate decreasing scenario the possible reduction of net interest income and npv should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv  respectively 
as our simulation measures indicate below  the net interest income increases decreases as market interest rates rise fall  since we were in an overall asset sensitive position with a positive gap for the three month timeframe 
the npv increases decreases as interest income increases decreases since the change in cash flows has a greater impact on the change in the npv than does the change in the discount rate 
however the extent of such changes was within the tolerance level prescribed by our alm policy due partly to the near balanced cumulative gap for the one year timeframe 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns

we also permit the purchase of rate caps and floors and interest rate swaps  although we only engaged once in the interest rate swap agreement in september on the notional amount of million which was subsequently terminated without any gain or loss by mutual agreement between us and a brokerage company in january
