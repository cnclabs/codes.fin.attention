item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands of dollars except for per share information 
introduction and overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the operating performance and financial condition of keithley instruments  inc a discussion of our business  including our strategy for growth  products and competition  is included in part i of this form k 
business overview our business is to design  develop  manufacture and market complex electronic instruments and systems geared to the specialized needs of electronics manufacturers for high performance production testing  process monitoring  product development and research 
our primary products are integrated systems used to source  measure  connect  control or communicate electrical direct current dc  radio frequency rf or optical signals 
our customers are engineers  technicians and scientists in manufacturing  product development and research functions 
during fiscal  semiconductor orders comprised approximately percent of our total orders  wireless communications orders were about percent  precision electronic components subassembly manufacturers were approximately percent  which includes customers in automotive  computers and peripherals  medical equipment  aerospace and defense  and manufacturers of components  and research and education orders were about percent 
the remainder of orders came from customers in a variety of other industries 
although our products vary in capability  sophistication  use  size and price  they generally test  measure and analyze electrical  rf  optical or physical properties 
as such  we consider our business to be in a single industry segment 
the most important factors influencing our ability to grow revenue are i our customers spending patterns as they invest in new capacity or upgrade manufacturing lines for new product offerings  ii our ability to offer interrelated products with differentiated value that solve our customers most compelling test challenges  and iii our success in penetrating key accounts with our globally deployed sales and service team 
we continue to believe that our strategy of pursuing a focused set of applications will allow us to grow faster than the overall test and measurement industry 
many of the industries we serve  including but not limited to the semiconductor industry  the wireless communications industry  and precision electronic components subassembly manufacturers  have historically been very cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
although our sales were up in fiscal from fiscal levels  our results for fiscal reflected reduced capital equipment spending among our customers in manufacturing  especially in the semiconductor industry 
additionally  our customers across all industries and geographies demonstrated reduced order patterns during the later part of our fourth quarter of fiscal which could also impact our fiscal results 
in response to the sequential order contraction we experienced  we took action during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our future operating expenses and expect a resulting benefit during fiscal additionally  during november we announced further cost reduction measures including a suspension of salary increases  a hiring freeze with the exception of a few critical replacements  and a reduction in our capital expenditures as well as travel and other discretionary spending 
our new product development spending for the year was down slightly from the prior year 
we believe that new product development is important  and we remain committed to maintain the necessary resources to implement our strategy in the short term to successfully introduce our new product launches that we have in development 
our focus during the past several years has been on building long term relationships and strong collaborative partnerships with our global customers to serve their measurement needs 
toward that end  we rely primarily upon employing our own sales personnel to sell our products  and use sales representatives  to whom we pay a commission  in areas where we believe it is not cost beneficial to employ our own people 
this sales channel strategy allows us to build a sales network of focused  highly trained sales engineers who specialize in measurement expertise and problem solving for customers and enhances our ability to sell our products to customers with worldwide operations 
we believe our ability to serve our customers has been strongly enhanced by deploying our own employees throughout the united states  europe and asia 
we expect that selling through our own sales force will be favorable to earnings during times of strong sales and unfavorable during times of depressed sales as a substantial portion of our selling costs are fixed 
we continue to believe that both the semiconductor and wireless areas drive change within the electronics industry 
these technology changes create many opportunities for us 
in fiscal  we opened a west coast development center  the sole focus of which is to develop our new rf product family 
rf measuring is increasingly becoming an important part of our customers requirements  as they are incorporating rf technology into their products 
during fiscal  we received important design wins for our rf products and our expanded offering has greatly increased our exposure to new customers and opportunities 
additionally  advances in technology require us to enhance our parametric test platforms to respond to our customers changing needs 
while we focus on these important initiatives  we cannot stop investing in our precision dc and current voltage i v product lines  as they serve the same core set of customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition keithley instruments  inc recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have been met when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
upon shipment  a provision is made for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns 
revenue earned from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual service periods  and is not material to the company s consolidated results 
shipping and handling costs are recorded as cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically review our recorded inventory and estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  our cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period 
income taxes keithley is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
judgment also is applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  which totaled  at september   we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of pretax operating income in each tax jurisdiction  the reversal of book versus tax differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
we have established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses nols in foreign  state and local tax jurisdictions which may not be realized due to the uncertainty of future profit levels in the respective jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance  until such nols are utilized or until such nols expire 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the realization of certain tax credits and the remaining deferred tax asset is dependent upon achieving future forecasted taxable income 
if actual results are significantly less than our forecast  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the tax credits or the remaining deferred tax assets  which totaled  at september  an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a material impact on our future earnings and financial position 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues based upon our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine that the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge of income tax expense would result 
pension plan retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business representing obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as the rate of return on plan assets assumption is a long term estimate  it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year  especially when markets are highly volatile 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that the rates we use are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective  as well as the plans asset mix between equities and fixed income investments 
assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations  and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate for the united states plan was determined as of the june  measurement date by constructing a portfolio of bonds with cash flows from coupon payments and maturities matching the projected benefit payments under the plan 
bonds considered in constructing the model portfolio are rated aa or higher by standard poor s 
callable bonds were excluded from consideration 
the longest maturity of any bond included in the data is august  benefit payments lying beyond were discounted back to this year using interest rates taken from the citigroup pension discount curve comparison to above median as of june  the matching bond portfolio produces coupon income in excess of what is needed to meet early period benefit payments 
the excess coupon income is accumulated as interest  based on the citigroup pension discount curve comparison to above median as of june   until such time as it is used to pay benefits 
the discount rate used in determining the recorded liability for our united states pension plan was for  compared to for and for the increase in the rate was primarily due to higher interest rates on long term  highly rated corporate bonds 
the discount rate for our german pension plan was for  compared to for and for the increase in the rate was primarily due to higher interest rates on long term  highly rated corporate bonds 
actual rate of loss return on united states plan assets was for compared to an expected rate of return of 
a increase decrease in the expected rate of return would have produced a decrease increase in expense 

table of contents the pension plan assets in germany are invested through an insurance company 
the insurance company directs the investments for this insurance contract 
because of the type of investments in the insurance contract  an expected rate of return of was assumed 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions for both the united states plan and non us plans based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
pension income or expense is allocated to cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  and product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the united states pension plan has experienced adverse asset returns from the june  measurement date through the end of the fiscal year 
if pension plan returns on assets continue at the september  level  the company would experience a non cash impact to its consolidated balance sheet and shareholders equity at the end of the next fiscal year as well as increased pension expense for fiscal see note g for additional information 
stock compensation plans with the adoption of sfas no 
r on october   the company is required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is primarily based upon observed historical volatility of keithley s stock price  as there is not a substantial enough market for exchange traded options 
during fiscal year  we used a stock price volatility assumption of 
with regard to the weighted average expected option life assumption  we consider several factors  including the historical option exercise behavior of our employees  historical cancellation rates of past options  and the current life of options outstanding and vested 
during fiscal year  we used an expected life assumption of years 
we also are required to estimate an expected forfeiture rate when recognizing compensation cost 
we review this rate every reporting period and adjust it when necessary based upon our past history of actual forfeitures 
we currently grant non cash compensation in the form of non qualified stock options  performance share units and restricted share units 
the final number of common shares to be issued pursuant to the performance share unit awards will be determined at the end of each three year performance period 
the awards granted in fiscal year and can be adjusted in percent increments and may range from a maximum of twice the initial award  as specified in the agreement  to a minimum of no units depending upon the level of attainment of performance thresholds 
we currently are accruing expense for performance share unit awards based upon our estimate that the number of shares to be issued will be equal to percent of the initial award amount for those granted in fiscal and percent of the initial award amount for those granted in we recorded the expense for the awards granted in which vested in equal to percent of the initial award amount 
our future earnings can fluctuate throughout the performance period specified in the agreements depending upon our estimate of the number of awards we expect will be issued upon the completion of the performance period 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
percent of net sales for the years ended september net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses product development expenses severance and related charges operating loss income investment income interest expense impairment of long term investments loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income we recorded a net loss of  or per diluted share for fiscal and  or per diluted share for fiscal we recorded net income of  or per diluted share  for net sales were  in compared with  in  and  in the increase in sales in was primarily the result of increased orders for our instrumentation products which more than offset a decrease in sales for our parametric testers  while the sales decrease in was primarily due to lower sales to our semiconductor production test customers for our parametric testers 
the effect of a 
table of contents weaker us dollar positively impacted sales growth by four percentage points in and one percent in  while the effect of a stronger us dollar negatively impacted sales growth by two percentage points in during fiscal and  we experienced a softening in conditions in the electronics industry that intensified during the later part of fiscal  particularly amongst our production semiconductor customers 
during the later part of fiscal and into fiscal  the broader electronics industry continued to slowdown 
throughout we had noted improving conditions in the strength of our customers and the electronics industry as a whole 
geographically  sales were up in the americas  in asia  and in europe during during  sales were down in the americas  up in asia  and down in europe 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost as a percentage of sales in was primarily the result of an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves and increased freight costs 
the increase in cost as a percentage of sales in over was primarily the result of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix 
foreign exchange hedging had a minimal effect on cost of goods sold in   and selling  general and administrative expenses of  increased in from  in  and increased less than in from  in the increase in over was primarily the result of increased foreign exchange costs due to the weaker us dollar  higher commissions and sales incentives  higher salary costs  and increased consultant costs 
these costs were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the stock option investigation and shareholder litigation that were included in the slight increase in over was the result of higher salaries due to increased headcount  higher costs associated with the stock option investigation and shareholder litigation  higher costs in our asian sales and support operations  and higher translation costs outside the us due to a weaker dollar 
these costs were offset by lower employee benefit costs  lower costs associated with stock based compensation as a result of adjusting the estimated expense for certain performance share award units to of target  and lower costs for bonuses and other incentives tied to financial performance 
during the second half of fiscal  we also reduced our discretionary spending for items such as consultants  temporary help and training 
product development expenses of  decreased from  in and increased in from  in the increase in was primarily a result of our increased investment in product development activities to expand our product offerings  including our rf product line 
during  we recorded  for costs associated with our announced reduction in global workforce 
we did not incur such costs during and see note j 
interest income was  in   in and  in the decrease in was the result of lower average cash and investment balances  a change in investment types  and lower average interest rates 
higher interest rates accounted for the increase in interest expense was in  in and in during  we recorded an impairment loss on our long term investments totaling  the impairment loss included  representing a valuation allowance against a note receivable from a company  as well as a  write down of our investment in that company that is carried at cost 
see note d 
the effective tax rate for fiscal  including discrete items  was a benefit of  compared to a benefit of for and an expense of in the effective benefit in was greater than the us statutory rate due to the recognition of current year research tax credits  state and local tax benefits and the recognition of benefits associated with prior year adjustments 
these benefits were partially offset by the net impact of losses in foreign jurisdiction which are not available for a tax benefit and the us tax on foreign remittances 
the effective benefit for was greater than the us statutory rate due to the current year utilization of research tax credits  and an benefit for the retroactive application of research tax credits for fiscal these benefits were partially offset by the net us tax on foreign remittances  effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions that are higher than the us statutory tax rate  and the net impact of other permanent differences 
the effective tax rate for was less than the us statutory rate due to the utilization of a foreign tax credit carryforward that previously had a valuation allowance against it  the release of the valuation allowance on the remainder of the foreign tax credit carryforward and tax benefits from extraterritorial income exclusion on us exports 
these benefits were partially mitigated by state and local income taxes and effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions that are higher than the us statutory tax rate 
see note i 
our financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
generally  a weakening us dollar versus foreign currency favorably impacts our foreign currency denominated sales 
a strengthening us dollar has an unfavorable effect 
this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect our foreign sales and earnings 
these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of keithley and our competition  whether competition is foreign or us based  changes in technology  product and customer mix  and local and worldwide economic conditions 
we utilize hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts 
we do not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments  and hedging techniques do not increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations

during the course of the year  we converted  of auction rate securities to cash 
accounts receivable and other  net decreased  due primarily to lower sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal year versus and lower days sales outstanding at september  of versus at september  inventories increased  during the year due primarily to lower than anticipated shipment demand for our products in the fourth quarter  lower than expected demand for our products serving the semiconductor industry  and an increase in demo inventories related to new products 
accrued payroll and related expenses increased  due primarily to recording a  liability at september  for severance charges related to the reduction in force

sources and uses of cash the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
cash from operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash expenses and changes in assets and liabilities 
during fiscal year  operating cash flows resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable  and the positive impact of non cash charges from depreciation  stock based compensation and asset impairment 
this was partially offset by non cash charges for deferred taxes  an increase in inventory  and  in contributions to the company s us pension plan 
see note g 
during fiscal year  operating cash flows resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable  and the positive impact of non cash charges for depreciation and stock based compensation 
this was partially offset by non cash charges for deferred income taxes  and  in contributions to the company s us pension plan 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal year compared to cash used in investing activities of in fiscal year cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase and sale of investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
capital spending was in  in versus  in we purchased  of short term investments in versus  last year  while sales of short term investments generated  in cash in  compared to  in short term investments totaled  at september  as compared to  at the same time last year 
during the course of fiscal year  we converted  of auction rate securities to cash 
additionally  the decrease in short term investments in fiscal was the result of the company s strategic initiative in accordance with its investment policy to maintain the safety and liquidity of its cash and investments 
financing activities 
cash used for financing activities in was  versus  in during fiscal year  we repurchased  of our common shares compared to  in see note c 
additionally  we repaid in short term debt during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year short term debt was at september  and at september  
table of contents the company s credit agreement  which expires march   is a  debt facility outstanding at september  that provides unsecured  multi currency revolving credit at various interest rates based on prime or libor 
we are required to pay a facility fee of on the total amount of the commitment 
additionally  the company has a number of other credit facilities in various currencies and for standby letters of credit aggregating  of short term debt and for standby letters of credit outstanding at september  at september   we had total unused lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks aggregating  of which  was long term and  was a combination of long term and short term depending upon the nature of the indebtedness 
see note e 
under certain provisions of the debt agreements  we are required to comply with various financial ratios and covenants 
we were in compliance with all such debt covenants  at september  and during each of the three years then ended 
our current stock repurchase program expires on february  under the current program we may repurchase up to an additional  common shares 
see note c 
during  we expect to finance capital spending  working capital requirements and the stock repurchase program with cash and short term investments on hand and cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to approximate  to set forth below is a table of information with respect to the company s contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations c total less than year years years more than years short term debt operating lease obligations payments under deferred compensation agreements a pension benefit b b b b b non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual obligations a includes amounts due under deferred compensation agreements with current and former employees and a director 
amounts exclude additional interest and investment gains or losses that will be earned or incurred from september  through the time of payment 
b the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of september  the company made a pension contribution of  in fiscal  and as such does not have a required contribution due in fiscal we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  what  if any  changes may occur in legislation  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions 
c the company does not consider its net uncertain tax liabilities of  to be a contractual obligation as this represents contingent liabilities that may or may not be realized 
furthermore  many of these uncertain tax liabilities  if realized  would result in a decrease to the deferred tax assets rather than a cash payment 
therefore the company has not reflected the uncertain tax positions in the contractual obligations table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements

this statement is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  the fasb did provide a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 
 an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently utilize foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix our margins 
generally  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
our policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when we have an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in our opinion  a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments nor therefore  on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio consisting of us government backed notes and bonds and corporate notes and bonds 
an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
however  in management s opinion  a percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
