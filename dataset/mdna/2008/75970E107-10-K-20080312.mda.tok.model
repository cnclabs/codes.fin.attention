item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses 
we have omitted a discussion of lease financing  as such financing comprised only approximately of our portfolio at december  commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans referred to as commercial loans  which accounted for approximately of our total loans at december   are customarily granted to established local business customers in our market area on a fully collateralized basis to meet their credit needs 
many of these loans have terms allowing the loan to be extended for periods of between one and five years 
loans are usually structured either to fully amortize over the term of the loan or to balloon after the third year or fifth year of the loan  typically with an amortization period not to exceed years 
the terms and loan structure are dependent on the collateral and strength of the borrower 
the loan to value ratios range from to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements  depending on the type of collateral 
the risks of these types of loans depend on the general business conditions of the local economy and the local business borrower s ability to sell its products and services in order to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions 
commercial lending generally involves greater credit risk than residential real estate or consumer lending and generally different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction loans 
although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets  the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default may represent an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may  among other things  be obsolete or of limited use 
accordingly  the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower and any guarantors  while liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment 
to manage these risks  the bank s policy is to secure its commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and any other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available 
in addition  we actively monitor certain financial measures of the borrower  including advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we employ the use of commercial loan credit scoring models for smaller level commercial loans 
real estate commercial mortgage 
our real estate commercial mortgage loans commercial real estate loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  we offer commercial real estate loans to developers of commercial properties for purposes of site acquisition and preparation and other development prior to actual construction 
in addition  loans in which the owner develops a property with the intention of occupying it are also included in commercial real estate loans 
because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful development  operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as a whole  in addition to the borrower s ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay us 
if our estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  we may not be able to obtain full repayment on the loan in the event of default and foreclosure 
we seek to minimize risks by limiting the maximum loan to value ratio and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan 
we also actively monitor such financial measures as advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we generally obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties to the transaction based on a review of personal financial statements 
real estate family mortgage 
we are active in the real estate family mortgage area referred to as residential real estate loans  with approximately of our total loans at december  being residential real estate loans 
we offer both first and second mortgages on residential real estate and loans for the preparation of residential real property prior to construction 
in addition  we offer home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers for purchases  refinances  home improvements  education and other personal expenditures 
both fixed and variable rate loans are offered with competitive terms and fees 
originations of residential real estate loans are generated through either retail efforts in our branches or wholesale marketing  which involves obtaining mortgage referrals from third party mortgage brokers 
we attempt to minimize the risk associated with residential real estate loans by strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  typically  we also limit the maximum loan to value ratio 
we retain loans for our portfolio when the bank has sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of established customers and when rates are favorable to retain the loans 
we also originate residential real estate loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market to third party private investors 
these loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate and are sold with servicing rights released 
mortgage loan originations to be sold are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors  and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded 
the risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market 
the company does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans 
we also offer home equity loans or lines of credit as an option to borrowers who elect to utilize the accumulated equity in their homes by borrowing money through either a first or second lien home equity loan or line of credit 
we limit our exposure to second lien home equity loans or lines of credit  which inherently carry a higher risk of loss upon default  by limiting these types of loans to borrowers with high credit scores 

table of contents 
index to financial statements real estate construction 
our real estate construction loans construction loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  our construction loan portfolio consists of loans for the construction of single family residential properties  multi family properties and commercial projects 
maturities for construction loans generally range from to months for residential property and from to months for non residential and multi family properties 
construction lending entails significant additional risks compared to residential mortgage or commercial real estate lending 
a significant additional risk is that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the property under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
thus  it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and to calculate related loan to value ratios 
to minimize the risks associated with construction lending  we limit loan to value ratios to of when completed appraised values for owner occupied and investor owned residential or commercial properties 
we believe that these loan to value ratios will be sufficient to compensate for fluctuations in the real estate market and thus minimize the risk of loss 
installment loans to individuals 
installment loans to individuals or consumer loans  which represented approximately of our total loans at december   are granted to individuals for the purchase of personal goods 
these loans are generally granted for periods ranging between one and six years at fixed rates of interest to above the prime interest rate quoted in the wall street journal 
loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences may represent risk of default to us 
in the event of default  a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose a loss to us in this loan category 
before granting a consumer loan  we assess the applicant s credit history and ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations 
although the applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral  if any  to the proposed loan amount 
we obtain a lien against the item securing the loan and hold title until the loan is repaid in full 
deposit services 
we offer a broad range of deposit services and products to our consumer and commercial clients 
through our community branch networks  we offer totally free consumer checking accounts with free internet banking with bill pay and free debit cards  interest bearing checking  money market accounts and savings accounts 
in addition  renasant offers certificates of deposit  individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts 
for our commercial clients  we offer a competitive suite of cash management products which include  but are not limited to  remote deposit capture  cd rom statements with account reconciliation  electronic statements  positive pay  ach origination and wire transfer  wholesale and retail lockbox  investment sweep accounts  enhanced business internet banking  outbound data exchange  multi bank reporting and international services 
the deposit services we offer accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in  and no material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single or small group of customers  and the loss of any single customer s deposits or a small group of customer s deposits would not have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the deposits held by our bank have been primarily generated within their respective market areas 
neither we nor the bank have any foreign activities 
other products and services 
through the financial services division of the bank  we also offer a wide variety of fiduciary services and administer as trustee or in other fiduciary or representative capacities qualified retirement plans  profit sharing and other employee benefit plans  personal trusts and estates 
in addition  the financial services division offers annuities  mutual funds and other investment services through a third party broker dealer 
the financial services division does not constitute a separately reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
operations of renasant insurance renasant insurance is a full service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers 
at december   renasant insurance contributed total revenue of million  or  of the company s total revenue and operated three offices in central and northern mississippi

index to financial statements competition banking vigorous competition exists in all major product and geographic areas in which we conduct banking business 
we compete through our bank with state  regional and national banks in all of our service areas  as well as savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  brokerage firms and investment companies for available loans and depository accounts 
all of these numerous institutions compete in the delivery of services and products through availability  quality and pricing  and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
for  we maintained approximately of the market share deposit base in our mississippi area  approximately in our tennessee area and approximately in our alabama area 
certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate 
we have identified these markets  which are listed in the table below  as our key growth markets 
at december   of our loans and of our deposits were located in these key markets 
the following table shows our deposit share in the counties that we consider our key markets as of june  which is the latest date that such information is available market available deposits in billions deposit share mississippi tupelo desoto county oxford alabama birmingham decatur huntsville madison tennessee germantown collierville memphis cordova nashville brentwood total source fdic  dated as of june  our major competitor in the birmingham and huntsville madison markets is regions bank  which maintains approximately and of the market share based on deposits  respectively  in those two markets 
we compete with regions bank for both loans and deposits 
first tennessee bank has a significant market share in the memphis market 
however  because of our footprint and our current lines of business in the memphis market  our business does not materially overlap with that of first tennessee bank in the memphis market 
in addition to the specific markets discussed above  regions bank and first tennessee bank compete with us in our other markets 
other competitors in these areas include bancorpsouth  cadence bank  compass bank  colonial bank  merchants and farmers bank primarily in mississippi and trustmark national bank 
in addition  there are smaller community banks in our service areas that compete with us on an individual market basis 
insurance we encounter strong competition in our markets in which we conduct insurance operations 
through our insurance subsidiary  we compete with independent insurance agencies and agencies affiliated with other banks and or other insurance carriers eg allstate  state farm  eg all of these agencies compete in the delivery of personal and commercial product lines 
there is no dominant insurance agency in our markets

index to financial statements supervision and regulation banking under the current regulatory environment  nearly every facet of our banking operations is regulated pursuant to various state and federal banking laws  rules and regulations 
the primary focus of these laws and regulations is the protection of depositors and the maintenance of the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole and the insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
while the following summary addresses the regulatory environment in which we operate  it is not intended to be a fully inclusive discussion of the statutes and regulations affecting our operations 
discussions of statutes and regulations in this section focus only on certain provisions of such statutes and regulations and do not purport to be comprehensive 
such discussions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the relevant statutes and regulations 
in addition  the impact from future changes in federal or state legislation on our operations cannot be predicted 
we are a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and are registered as such with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
we are required to file with the federal reserve an annual report and such other information as the federal reserve may require 
the federal reserve may also make examinations of us and the bank pursuant to the act 
the federal reserve has the authority which to date it has not exercised to regulate provisions of certain types of our debt 
the act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority owned by such bank holding company 
the act further provides that the federal reserve shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
the federal reserve will also not approve any transaction in which the effect of the transaction might be to substantially lessen competition or in any manner amount to a restraint on trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the benefits to the public interest resulting from the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the act also prohibits a bank holding company  with certain exceptions  from itself engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
the principal exception to this prohibition is for a bank holding company engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making determinations whether activities are closely related to banking or managing banks  the federal reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency of resources and whether such public benefits outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects  such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices 
the company and the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act and the federal deposit insurance act on any extensions of credit to the company or the bank  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company or the bank and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower 
on november   the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act eliminates the barriers erected by the glass steagall act and amends the act  among other statutes 
further  it allows for the affiliation of banking  securities and insurance activities in new financial services organizations 
a dominant theme of the financial services modernization act is functional regulation of financial services  with the primary regulator of the company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the company or its subsidiaries wishes to engage 
for example  the securities and exchange commission sec will regulate bank holding company securities transactions  and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the principal provisions of the financial services modernization act permit the company  so long as it meets the standards for a well managed and well capitalized institution and has at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act performance rating  to engage in any activity that is financial in nature  including security and insurance underwriting  investment banking and merchant banking investing in commercial and industrial companies 
the company  if it satisfies the above criteria  can file a declaration of its status as a financial holding company fhc with the federal reserve and thereafter engage directly or through nonbank subsidiaries in the expanded range of activities which the financial services modernization act identifies as financial in nature 
further  the company  if it elects fhc status  will be able to pursue additional activities which are incidental or complementary in nature to a financial activity or which the federal reserve subsequently determines to be financial in nature 
we have not elected to become an fhc 
under the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate act  the company or any other bank holding company located in mississippi is able to acquire a bank located in any other state  and a bank holding company located outside mississippi can acquire any mississippi based bank  in either case subject to certain deposit percentage and other restrictions 
the interstate act also provides that  unless an individual state has elected to prohibit out of state banks from operating interstate branches within its territory  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies may consolidate their multistate bank operations into a single bank subsidiary and branch interstate through acquisitions 
under mississippi law  out of state bank holding companies may establish a bank in mississippi only by acquiring a mississippi bank or mississippi bank holding company 
bank holding companies are allowed to acquire savings associations under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea 
deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of firrea  and losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally insured financial institutions 
the bank is chartered under the laws of the state of mississippi and as a result is subject to the supervision of  and is regularly examined by  the department of banking and consumer finance of the state of mississippi 
certain restrictions exist under mississippi law regarding the ability of our bank to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
the approval of the department of banking and consumer finance of the state of mississippi is required prior to the bank paying dividends 
the amount of any dividend is limited to earned surplus in excess of three times its capital stock 
federal reserve regulations also limit the amount the bank may loan to us unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic  and the bank is subject to examination and review by that regulatory authority 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia provides for increased funding for the fdic s deposit insurance fund through risk based assessments and expands the regulatory powers of federal banking agencies to permit prompt corrective actions to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the community reinvestment act of requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of into law 
this act contains the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the imlafa 
the imlafa substantially broadens existing anti money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states  imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations  creates new crimes and penalties  compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states  including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the united states and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers 
the us treasury department has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our bank 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and 
table of contents

the imlafa requires all financial institutions  as defined  to establish anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
such programs must include  among other things  adequate policies  the designation of a compliance officer  employee training programs and an independent audit function to review and test the program 
the company believes that it has complied with these requirements 
insurance renasant insurance is subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of the united states and the state of mississippi 
the laws and regulations are primarily for the benefit of clients 
in all jurisdictions  the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment by regulatory authorities 
generally  such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons  including the violation of such regulations  conviction of crimes and the like 
possible sanctions which may be imposed for violation of regulations include suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time  revocation of licenses  censures and fines 
monetary policy and economic controls we and the bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying degrees to influence overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the various money markets  as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve  the effect on our  and the bank s  future business and earnings cannot be predicted with accuracy 
sources and availability of funds the funds essential to our  and our bank s  business consist primarily of funds derived from customer deposits  federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank advances and borrowings from correspondent banks by the bank 
the availability of such funds is primarily dependent upon the economic policies of the federal government  the economy in general and the general credit market for loans

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this form k and the exhibits hereto  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
the risks disclosed below  either alone or in combination  could materially adversely affect the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business and industry we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk to our financial condition than other types of loans due primarily to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  approximately of our loan portfolio had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan 
an adverse change in the value of real estate generally and in our markets specifically could significantly impair the value of the collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower s obligations to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our commercial  construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios are discussed in more detail under the caption operations operations of the bank in item  business 
we have a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate 
at december   we had approximately million in commercial real estate loans  representing approximately of our loans outstanding on that date 
in addition to the general risks associated with our lending activities described above  commercial real estate loans are subject to additional risks 
commercial real estate loans depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt 
cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions  and a downturn in the local economy generally or in occupancy rates where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default 
in addition  banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting  internal controls  risk management policies and portfolio stress testing  as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposure 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished by others about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient 
although we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry  management also maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on management s quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collateral impairment 
among other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments  the unemployment rate in our markets  loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of the policies and procedures related to management s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is set forth under the caption risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets  such as loans and securities  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  which could reduce the amount of fee income generated  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income could be adversely affected  which in turn could negatively affect our earnings 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the results of our operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments  such as us government and agency securities and other investment vehicles  including mutual funds  which generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements 
disintermediation could also result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of the policies and procedures used to identify  assess and manage certain interest rate risk is set forth under the caption risk management interest rate risk in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on the dividends from the bank as our primary source of funds 
the primary source of the bank s funds are customer deposits and loan repayments 
while scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans 
the ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors  including changes in economic conditions  adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups  reductions in real estate values or markets  business closings or lay offs  inclement weather  natural disasters and international instability 
additionally  deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors  including rates paid by competitors  general interest rate levels  returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations or to support growth 
such sources include federal home loan bank advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks 
while we believe that these sources are currently adequate  there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands  particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand 
if the aforementioned sources of liquidity are not adequate for our needs  we may attempt to raise additional capital in the capital markets 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in such markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital in this manner 
if we are unable to meet our liquidity needs  we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth  capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets 
our business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
since  we have significantly grown our business outside our mississippi footprint through the acquisition of entire financial institutions and through de novo branching 
we intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business through de novo branching 
in addition  although we have no current intentions regarding new acquisitions in the next few years  we expect to continue to evaluate attractive acquisition opportunities that are presented to us 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in growth stages of development  including the following management of growth 
we may be unable to successfully maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth  maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth  maintain adequate internal audit  loan review and compliance functions  and implement additional policies  procedures and operating systems required to support such growth 
operating results 
there is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels  loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits 
our growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff 
our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices 
should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable  or should any existing location experience a decline in profitability or incur losses  the adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company 
development of offices 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches  and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more 
accordingly  our de novo branches can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale 
our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our de novo branches 
we may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites  difficulties in acquiring such sites  increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes  higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors 
finally  we have no assurance our de novo branches or branches that we may acquire will be successful even after they have been established or acquired  as the case may be 

table of contents 
index to financial statements expansion into new markets 
much of our recent growth  and all of our growth through acquisitions  has been focused in the highly competitive memphis and nashville  tennessee and birmingham and huntsville  alabama metropolitan markets 
the customer demographics and financial services offerings in these markets are unlike those found in the mississippi markets that we have historically served 
in these growth markets we face competition from a wide array of financial institutions  including much larger  well established financial institutions 
our expansion into these new markets may be unsuccessful if we are unable to meet customer demands or compete effectively with the financial institutions operating in these markets 
regulatory and economic factors 
our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events 
failure to obtain required regulatory approvals  changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion 
such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process  which may prevent us from entering certain target markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing or expected markets 
failure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may face risks with respect to future acquisitions 
when we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions  we seek partners that are culturally similar to us  have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger partners  inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations  entry into new markets where we lack experience  and risks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  which are discussed below 
although we have no current intentions regarding new mergers or acquisitions in the next few years  we expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in  we merged with capital  and in we merged with heritage 
details of these transactions are presented in note t  mergers and acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in
