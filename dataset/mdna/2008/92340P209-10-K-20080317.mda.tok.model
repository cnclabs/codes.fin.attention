overview we operate in two business segments  biofuels and specialty enzymes 
our biofuels business segment operates through our wholly owned subsidiary  verenium biofuels corporation  and is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our biofuels business segment is the large scale commercial production of cellulosic ethanol derived from multiple biomass feedstocks 
our specialty enzymes segment develops customized enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and health and nutrition markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we believe the most significant near term commercial opportunity for our specialty enzymes business segment will be derived from continued sales growth  and related profit margin improvement  from our existing portfolio of enzyme products 
our biofuels and specialty enzymes business are both supported by a research and development team with expertise in gene discovery and optimization  cell engineering  bioprocess development  biochemistry and microbiology 
over the past years  our research and development team has developed a proprietary technology platform which has enabled us to apply advancements in science to discovering and developing unique solutions in complex industrial or commercial applications 
to date  we have dedicated substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies  which include capabilities for sample collection from the world s microbial populations  generation of dna libraries  screening of these libraries using ultra high throughput methods capable of analyzing more than one billion genes per day  and optimization based on our gene evolution technologies 
we have continued to shift more of our resources from technology development to commercialization efforts for our existing and future products 
while our technologies have the potential to serve many large markets  our key areas of focus for internal product development are i integrated solutions for the production of cellulosic biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol  and ii specialty enzymes for biofuels  specialty industrial processes  and health and nutrition 
we have current collaborations with market leaders  such as basf  bunge oils  cargill health and food technologies  and syngenta ag  each of which complement our internal product development efforts 
we expect to continue to invest heavily in these commercialization efforts  and to expand our investment in technology and enzyme development  primarily in the area of biofuels 
we believe this investment will not only benefit our efforts to advance the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol within our biofuels business unit  but will also enable us to create additional enzyme commercialization opportunities within our specialty enzymes unit that are focused more broadly on the biofuels industry 
we have a substantial intellectual property estate comprising more than issued patents and more than pending patents as of february we believe that this intellectual property estate creates leverage which allows us to enhance and improve our technology development and commercialization efforts across both business units while maintaining protection on key intellectual property assets 
for the year ended december   total revenues decreased compared to the year ended december   while product related revenue increased over the same period 
as part of our strategic reorganization in january  we began to de emphasize grant revenue and certain collaborations that are not strategic to our current market focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
as a result  we expect that product revenue will continue to represent a larger percentage of our total revenues in the future  and that collaborative revenue will continue to decrease 
however  certain of our partners and funding sources have ongoing obligations to fund our programs  and we have ongoing obligations to provide research and development services under our current agreements 
as of december   our strategic partners have provided us with more than million in funding since inception and are committed to additional funding of more than million through  subject to our performance under existing agreements  excluding milestone payments  license and commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing 
our strategic partners often pay us before we recognize the revenue  and these payments are deferred until earned 
as of december   we had deferred revenue totaling million  of which million was related to funding from collaborative partners  and million was related to product sales 
we have incurred net losses since our inception 
as of december  our accumulated deficit was million 
our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
we expect to incur losses into the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated additional investments to implement our biofuels commercialization strategy  including capital expenditures related to enhancements of our cellulosic ethanol pilot facility and construction of our demonstration facility  our continued investment in sales and marketing infrastructure intended to strengthen our customer contact and focus  our continued investment in manufacturing facilities necessary to meet anticipated increased demand for our products  and continued research and development expenses for our internal product candidates 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  we believe that our historical results are not a good indicator of our future operating results 
as more fully described in the risk factors beginning on page  liquidity and capital resources beginning on page and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this annual report on form k  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we believe that we will be successful in generating additional cash through a combination of corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal and state grant funding  and incremental product sales  if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources  we may need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures  restructure or significantly curtail our operations  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
recent strategic events  financing transactions  and capital requirements completion of merger transaction and creation of verenium corporation in june  we completed our merger with celunol corp  with celunol continuing as a surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of diversa 
following the merger  diversa was renamed verenium corporation and celunol was renamed verenium biofuels corporation 
in connection with the merger  we issued million shares of our common in exchange for all outstanding capital stock of celunol  and issued million options and warrants to purchase our common stock in exchange for celunol options and warrants that we assumed 
as a result of and immediately following the merger  former celunol security holders owned approximately of the company  while former diversa shareholders owned approximately 
immediately following the merger  we had approximately million shares outstanding 
we currently conduct our research activities at our centralized research and development facility in san diego  as well as at our pilot plant in jennings  louisiana 
we have successfully conducted laboratory tests on a wide range of feedstocks to produce ethanol from agricultural residues  including agricultural wastes such as sugar cane bagasse  corn fiber  sugar beet pulp  citrus pulp and citrus peels  wood wastes  such as saw and pulp mill waste  forestry wastes  such as hardwood and softwood thinnings  rice hulls  rice straw  and corn stover  and urban wastes  such as the paper portion of municipal solid waste and municipal green wastes 
we believe our success in laboratory testing of a wide range of feedstocks will provide us the flexibility to utilize an array of feedstocks in our production process 
due to this feedstock flexibility  we believe we will be able to locate facilities in a variety of different geographic markets and  in many cases  closer to end use markets 
in  we completed a significant upgrade of our cellulosic ethanol pilot plant in jennings  louisiana 
we believe that this pilot plant is among the nation s first pilot scale cellulosic ethanol plants  and represents a key asset of our on going research and development program  providing us with the opportunity to refine production processes and validate our technology 
we have been constructing a million gallons per year demonstration plant on the same site  and currently expect this plant to be mechanically complete by the end of march  after which the facility will go through an extensive start up  commissioning and optimization phase throughout the balance of we believe that this facility represents one of the first demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facilities in the united states 
further  we believe our combined pilot and demonstration plant facilities will enable us to refine our production processes in advance of building  or partnering with others to build  commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production facilities 
both the pilot plant and the demonstration plant are located at a site we own in jennings  louisiana 
research collaboration with syngenta ag in january  we announced a new year research and development partnership with syngenta ag  or syngenta  focused on the discovery and development of a range of novel enzymes to economically convert pre treated cellulosic biomass to mixed sugars a critical step in the process of biofuel production 
the new agreement replaced our prior agreement with syngenta 
our prior collaboration agreement with syngenta was a broad research and product development collaboration in which the two companies worked on various exclusive projects together across various fields 
the prior agreement provided for a minimum of million of research funding over a seven year research period beginning in  of which approximately million was received through its termination in the prior agreement led to product candidates for the production of biofuels such as ethanol from corn  and enzymes to improve the digestibility and reduce the environmental impact of phosphorus and other nutrients naturally contained in animal feed 
however  the prior agreement covered significantly more exclusive fields and applications than were ultimately being taken to the marketplace 
we believe that the new agreement is more focused and better aligned with each company s core strengths 
under the terms of the new agreement  syngenta has committed a minimum of million in the first two years of the year term to fund joint research and development activities  largely in defined areas of biofuels 
in addition  we will be entitled to development and commercialization related milestone payments upon achievement of specified milestones  as well as royalties on any products that are commercialized by syngenta 
the new agreement allows us the freedom to operate independently in all fields  and to market and sell fermentation based enzyme products developed either under the collaboration or by us independently 
syngenta retains the rights to market and sell plant expressed  or transgenic  enzyme products developed under the collaboration in the fields of animal feed and biofuels 
we have also licensed its existing collection of enzymes for plant expression to syngenta within these two fields 
as a result of the restructuring of our syngenta agreement  our minimum guaranteed collaborative funding was reduced by approximately million  with approximately million of this reduction occurring in financing transactions completion of convertible notes offering in late march and early april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement  generating net cash proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  to permit registered resale of the notes and of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the notes bear interest at per year  payable in cash semi annually  and are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase into shares of verenium common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate of the notes may be increased if the average price of the company s common stock for a period ending on april  is less than or in certain circumstances if a holder surrenders notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change that occurs before april  on or after april   the company may  at its option  redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on each of april   april  and april   holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date 
holders may also require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  a fundamental change is broadly defined as a change in control  or a termination of trading of our common stock 
we have used the net proceeds of this offering for continued expansion of our biofuels business  including ongoing construction of a demonstration scale ethanol facility  continued investment in product development and commercialization efforts in our specialty enzyme business  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
as described below  in connection with our recent private placement of new convertible notes  we entered into exchange agreements with certain noteholders  representing million in aggregate principal of the existing convertible senior notes 
completion of convertible notes offering on february   we completed a private placement of senior convertible notes due april   or the new notes  and warrants to purchase our common stock 
concurrent with entering into the purchase agreement  we also entered into senior notes exchange agreements with certain existing holders of our notes pursuant to which such noteholders exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the new notes and for warrants to purchase common stock 
including the new notes to be issued in exchange for the notes  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the new notes and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
gross proceeds from new investment were approximately million and net proceeds from new investment  after giving effect to payment of certain transaction related expenses and the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction described below  were approximately million 
the new notes will be convertible on the date of their issuance 
their initial conversion price will be equal to per share 
the conversion price will be subject to full ratchet anti dilution protection and a reset provision whereby  to the extent the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the seven trading days prior to the one year anniversary of the issuance of the new notes is less than per share  the conversion price will reset to the greater of per share or of the volume weighted average price of the common stock at that time 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including that an effective resale registration statement for the applicable shares be on file  interest payments on the new notes may be made  at our option  in shares of common stock  valued at a discount to the stock price at the time of payment of the interest 
in the event that we do not receive shareholder approval for issuances of shares beyond of the number of our issued and outstanding shares as of february   any required share issuances under the new notes in excess of that amount will be settled for cash in an amount per share equal to the closing sales price of our common stock on the conversion date 
the new notes are subject to automatic conversion at our option if our closing stock price exceeds per share over a trading day period ending prior to the date we provide notice of the automatic conversion to investors  the average daily trading volume of our stock over that trading day period equals or exceeds million  and certain other conditions are met 
the warrants are exercisable six months after their issuance 
the initial exercise price of the warrants will be per share 
the exercise price will be subject to weighted average anti dilution protection 
we are not permitted to issue shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants unless and until we receive shareholder approval for such issuances 
if such shareholder approval is obtained  the warrants  beginning six months after their issuance  will be exercisable for shares of our common stock 
if such shareholder approval is not obtained  the warrants will never be exercisable for shares of common stock and will only be settled for cash on exercise in an amount per share issuable equal to the closing sales price of our common stock on the exercise date less the applicable warrant exercise price 
in connection with the transactions described above  we entered into a convertible hedge transaction with a counterparty  which is intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the new notes 
the convertible hedge transaction is composed of two separate call options 
under the first call option  on april  or earlier upon conversion of the new notes  we will be entitled to purchase  shares of our common stock from the counterparty at a price per share equal to the initial conversion price or a proportion of such number of shares based on the proportion of the senior convertible notes being converted 
under the second call option  on three exercise dates staggered in six month intervals beginning on october   the counterparty will be entitled to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction was approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the new notes and warrants for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the completion of construction  commissioning and start up of our cellulosic ethanol demonstration facility 
years ended december  and selected segment financial data as a result of our merger with celunol on june   our business now consists of two business units  which we refer to as our biofuels segment and our specialty enzymes segment 
the biofuels segment is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels  in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass 
the specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels  specialty industrial processes  and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput  lower costs  and improved environmental outcomes 
we assess performance and allocate resources based on discrete financial information for the biofuels and specialty enzymes segments 
for the biofuels segment  performance is assessed based on total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the specialty enzymes segment performance is assessed based on total revenues  product revenues  product gross profit  total operating expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   the specialty enzyme segment comprised of our total revenues  product revenue  and cost of product revenue 
our operating expenses for each segment include direct and allocated research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in management s evaluation of performance  certain corporate operating expenses are excluded from the business segments such as non cash share based compensation  restructuring charges  severance  depreciation and amortization  write off of acquired in process research and development  and other corporate expenses  which are not allocated to either business segment 
in addition  we evaluate segment performance based upon capital expenditures and other assets that are specifically identified to the business segment  excluding certain corporate assets such as goodwill and other assets that can be attributed to  or utilized by  both business segments 
expenses and assets shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments 
different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment 
selected operating results for the year ended december  and identifiable assets as of december  for each of our business segments is set forth below in thousands year ended december  biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total collaborative and grant revenue product revenue total revenues product gross profit acquired in process research and development operating expenses  excluding cost of product revenue and acquired in process research and development loss from operations capital expenditures identifiable assets by operating segment are set forth below as of december  biofuels specialty enzymes corporate total total identifiable assets since we only began operating in two business segments during  there is no separate segment financial information available prior to for comparative purposes 
consolidated results of operations revenues change revenues phyzyme phytase all other products total product collaborative grant total revenues revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   attributed primarily to a decrease in collaborative and grant revenue  offset in large part by an increase in product revenues 
our revenue mix has shifted to a larger percentage of product revenue  consistent with our strategy to grow product sales and de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our strategic market focus 
product revenue represented of total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenue and profit sharing associated with phyzyme xp phytase sold through our collaboration with danisco 
phyzyme revenue has been positively impacted during primarily related to the following factors in late  the eu commission granted permanent authorization for the use of phyzyme xp in broiler poultry feed in europe which has expanded the end user market for phyzyme xp  in late  danisco introduced a dry pelletized  thermally stable formulation of phyzyme xp  and beginning in late  due to an increase in the cost of phosphates an animal feed additive  sales volumes of phyzyme xp to danisco s current customers have been positively impacted  as many of these customers have increased phyzyme dosages as a replacement for higher cost phosphates 
the increase in product revenue is also attributed to an increase in sales of our other commercial enzyme products  including quantum phytase and fuelzyme lf 
while we anticipate an increase in revenue from our non phyzyme products  we expect that phyzyme will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total product revenue in the foreseeable future 
collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million from million and accounted for and of total revenue for the years ended december  and this decrease is primarily a result of the restructuring of our collaboration with syngenta at the beginning of we have continued to de emphasize collaborations that are not core to our current focus in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
we anticipate that collaborative revenue will continue to decrease in as compared to  due in large part to this de emphasis of non strategic collaborations  but also due to a decrease in revenue related to the expected wind down of projects with existing strategic collaborators such as syngenta  bunge  and basf 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to expand  renew  or enter into new collaborations that we believe fit our strategic focus and represent product commercialization opportunities in the future  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in renewing or expanding existing collaborations  or securing new collaboration partners 
grant revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  since late  we have continued to de emphasis grants and government contracts that are not core to our strategic focus 
we do not expect our grant revenue to return to the levels we achieved in and  however  we may elect to pursue additional opportunities in the foreseeable future to secure federal  state or local agency funding to support our biofuels initiatives 
for example  in early and we were awarded two grants to be funded by the department of energy to discover and develop new enzymes and enzyme cocktails to break down various types of biomass 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products  timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  as well as regulatory approval timelines for new products 
we anticipate that our revenue mix will continue to shift toward a higher percentage of product related revenue 
product gross profit gross margin change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin product gross profit margin product revenue less cost of product revenue totaled million  or of product revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  this gross margin improvement is reflective of higher sales volumes to absorb our fixed costs  as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and yields 
because phyzyme represents a significant percentage of our product revenue  our product gross margin is impacted to a great degree by the gross margin achieved on sales of phyzyme 
under our agreement with danisco  we sell our phyzyme inventory to danisco at our cost and then share of danisco s profit  as defined  when the product is sold to the end user 
as a result  our total cost of product revenue for phyzyme is incurred as we ship product to danisco  and profit share revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is sold to the end user as reported to us by danisco 
our gross margin from phyzyme has been below expectations to date due primarily to higher than anticipated product launch and related marketing costs incurred by danisco  however  we expect our phyzyme gross margins to improve as a result of the anticipated increase in sales volume in in addition  our gross margin is dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product revenue varies from product to product 
we believe that our gross margin should be positively impacted as we grow sales of products we market and sell directly to end users  namely fuelzyme lf and purifine  which are expected to have higher gross margins than our phyzyme products 
cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products that have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   cost of product related revenue increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in our fixed manufacturing costs under our contract with fermic  sa  or fermic  our manufacturing partner in mexico city  as well as the increase in product revenues 
despite the increase in fixed costs our gross margin improved to in from in we expect our gross margins in to be positively impacted by continued growth in sales of phyzyme xp and our other products  as well as cost efficiencies we expect to achieve as we continue to scale up production and improve our manufacturing yields 
because a large percentage of our manufacturing costs are fixed  we will realize continued margin improvements as product related revenues increase  however  our margins may be negatively impacted in the future if our product related revenues do not grow in line with our increase in minimum capacity requirements at fermic 
for example  during december  we expanded our manufacturing capabilities at fermic  which will increase our fixed manufacturing costs by approximately million per quarter  and we are planning to further expand our manufacturing capabilities in the fourth quarter of  which will increase our fixed manufacturing costs by an additional million per quarter 
in addition  our gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product related sales as the cost of product related revenue varies from product to product 
research and development change research and development our research and development expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to incremental payroll and related expenses for biofuels technology development activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
we track our researchers time by type of project 
however  we do not track other research and development costs by project  rather  we track such costs by the type of cost incurred 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants  and that approximately were spent on internal product and technology development 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel related costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants  and that approximately were spent on internal product and technology development 
research and development direct personnel related costs and unallocated non personnel costs incurred by type of project during the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands collaborations syngenta other total collaborations grants internal development unallocated non personnel our internal development costs relate primarily to early stage discovery of new enzymes  regulatory work for mid stage development products  bioprocess development and technical support for late stage development  and research and development efforts dedicated to our cellulosic ethanol process development activities 
we consider early stage projects to be those which are experimental in nature  and are often short lived 
we consider mid stage development products to be those that are potential candidates to advance to regulatory and commercialization stages 
we consider late stage products those that have been approved for their intended use by one or more regulatory agencies  have already been introduced commercially  or such commercial introduction is pending 
our expenses related to cellulosic ethanol process development relate primarily to our development activities to commercialize cellulosic ethanol 
we estimate that our allocation of internal research and development personnel related costs during the years ended december  and was as follows in thousands early stage product development mid stage product development late stage product development cellulosic ethanol process development r d support activities the increase in our internal development costs was largely the result of our merger with celunol corp  our emphasis on biofuels process development  and  to a lesser extent  the decrease in funding from syngenta 
we have re deployed these resources into internal development projects  primarily within our biofuels segment 
our allocation of research and development resources varies from period to period and is largely dependent upon resources we have available over and above what is funded by our partners  however  we believe that our internal development projects are benefited to some extent by work we perform under our funded collaborative agreements 
total research and development costs incurred for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands personnel related laboratory and supplies outside services equipment and depreciation facilities  overhead and other scale up manufacturing costs share based compensation our research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributed to a million increase in personnel related costs for direct research and development  primarily for biofuels technology development activities incurred subsequent to our merger with celunol on june  our outside services increased million primarily related to process improvements for our pilot facility and demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facility in jennings  louisiana 
our facilities and overhead costs increased million and equipment and depreciation increased million primarily related to our pilot and demonstration facilities 
we have a limited history of developing commercial products 
we determine which products to pursue independently based on various criteria  including investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts 
the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including product trials and regulatory approvals  if needed 
it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products  if any  are ultimately marketed 
we have several product candidates in various stages of development related to collaborations and grants as well as internally developed products 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products that we had intended to pursue independently 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have any products approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in this report under risk factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses change selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses more than doubled to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  from million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  this increase is largely due to incremental personnel and overhead costs resulting from the merger and  to a lesser extent  increased personnel costs and professional services costs to support the growth in product sales and increased complexity of our business  combined with the following non recurring expenses million increase in share based compensation primarily related to million in severance obligations to former executives pursuant to transitional employment agreements and million for new restricted stock awards and stock option grants primarily for our new executive management team  partially offset by lower share based compensation from existing awards and grants  and million in cash severance and bonus costs primarily related to obligations to former executives in connection with the merger 
while the non recurring severance related obligations and other merger related expenses will not be repeated in  we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in to support both the anticipated growth in sales of our specialty enzyme products and our biofuels commercialization efforts 
share based compensation charges we recognized million  or per share  and million  or per share  in share based compensation expense for our share based awards during and these charges had no impact on our reported cash flows 
share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands year ended december  research and development selling  general and administrative included in share based compensation for the year ended december  are non recurring charges of million related to modification of vesting for restricted stock awards for certain executives in connection with separation agreements relating to the merger with celunol 
in addition  our share based compensation charges increased primarily due to additional options and awards granted to our new executive team in connection with our merger 
acquired in process research and development we allocated million of the purchase price in connection with our merger with celunol to acquired in process research and development projects 
acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  represents the valuation of acquired  to be completed research projects 
celunol s ongoing research and development initiatives have primarily involved the development of its patented and proprietary biotechnology to enable production of fuel grade ethanol from cellulosic biomass materials 
as of the merger date  pursuant to authoritative guidance under sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  these projects were not determined to have reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the second quarter of  the period in which the merger was consummated 
we consider the research projects acquired at the merger date collectively to be our generation or gen technology 
to date  we have demonstrated that our gen technology can produce cellulosic ethanol at a small scale in the laboratory and pilot plant  but at yields and cost that are not yet commercially viable 
we will require continued and substantial investment to develop our gen technology  and continue to believe that gen will produce a viable technology that will be deployed on a commercial scale as early as for the year ended december   the substantial portion of our internal research and development personnel related costs allocated to cellulosic ethanol process development of million were either directly or indirectly related to the further development of our gen technology 
if these projects are not successfully developed  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
we believe that the assumptions used in the ipr d valuation analysis were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
restructuring charges we recorded charges of million during the year ended december  in connection with our strategic reorganization in january  which included costs for employee separation and estimates for facilities consolidation costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of additional charges reflecting revisions in our estimates for our remaining net facilities consolidation costs upon executing a sublease agreement with a subtenant in october we may further revise these estimates in future periods  which could give rise to additional charges or adjustments 
interest and other income  net interest income on cash and short term investments was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in cash and investments resulting from proceeds from our notes offering  as well as higher average rates of return on our investments  consistent with the increase in short term interest rates from to interest expense was million  net of million in capitalized interest for the demonstration facility  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributed to interest on the notes we issued in march and april provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  we incurred net operating losses and  accordingly  did not record a provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  which will begin to expire in unless utilized 
our net operating loss carry forwards for state tax purposes were approximately million as of december   which will begin to expire in unless utilized 
we also had federal research credits of approximately million which will begin to expire in  california research credits of approximately million which will carry over indefinitely  and california manufacturer s investment credits of approximately million which will begin to expire in pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of the company s net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited due to cumulative changes in ownership of more than 
years ended december  and the information discussed below for years ended december  and relates to historical financial results for diversa only 
it does not include the historical financial results of celunol corp 
nor does it include the proforma financial results to reflect the effects of the merger with celunol corp 
revenues change revenues phyzyme phytase all other products total product collaborative grant total revenues revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in collaborative and grant revenue  offset in part by an increase in product related revenues 
collaborative revenue decreased  or million  to million  for year ended december  from million for year ended december   and accounted for and of total revenue in and this decrease is primarily a result of our de emphasis of certain grants and collaborations that are not core to our current focus  including pharmaceutical collaborations  in favor of greater emphasis on sales of products 
product revenue for the year ended december  increased to  million from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increased revenue and profit sharing associated with phyzyme xp phytase sold through our collaboration with danisco animal nutrition  or danisco  as well as increased sales from most of our other commercial enzyme products  including bayovac srs and luminase pb in september  the eu commission granted permanent authorization for the use of phyzyme xp in broiler poultry feed in europe  which positively impacted sales of phyzyme xp in during  we shipped approximately million in valley ultra thin enzyme to our former us distributor  valley research  inc  or valley 
we deferred revenue on our sales of this product to valley 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  and in the notes the consolidated financial statements  we are currently in a legal dispute with valley over alleged breach of contract  and have terminated our distribution agreement 
we currently market this product under the fuelzyme lf brand through our direct salesforce 
on march   we issued a letter to valley terminating our distribution agreement with valley  effective immediately  on the basis of valley s not having met certain minimum purchase requirements 
grant revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this is due in large part to our de emphasis of grants and government contracts 
we do not expect our grant revenue to return to the levels we achieved in and our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under existing and future collaboration agreements  regulatory approval timelines for new products  as well as adoption rates of our new and existing commercial products 
product gross profit gross margin change product revenue cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross margin cost of product revenue includes both fixed and variable costs  including materials and supplies  labor  facilities and other overhead costs  associated with our product revenues 
excluded from cost of product revenue are costs associated with the scale up of manufacturing processes for new products which have not reached commercial scale production volumes  which we include in our research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   cost of product related revenue increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in our fixed manufacturing costs under our contract with fermic  our manufacturing partner in mexico city  as well as the increase product revenues 
we generated a positive gross margin of approximately during despite an increase in fixed costs over the prior year 
this compares to a negative gross margin of in this gross margin improvement is reflective of higher sales volumes to absorb our fixed costs  as well as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and yields 
we expect that the cost of product related revenue will decrease as a percentage of product related revenue once we have completed our manufacturing ramp up and have achieved a scalable volume of product sales 
we expect our gross margins to be positively impacted by continued growth in sales of phyzyme xp and our other products  as well as cost efficiencies we expect to achieve as we scale up production and improve our manufacturing yields 
because a large percentage of our manufacturing costs are fixed  we will realize continued margin improvements as product related revenues increase  however  our margins may be negatively impacted in the future if our product related revenues do not grow in line with our increase in minimum capacity requirements at fermic 
for example  during the quarter ending september   we expanded our manufacturing capabilities at fermic  which increased our fixed manufacturing costs by approximately million per quarter 
in addition  our gross margins are dependent upon the mix of product sales as the cost of product related revenue varies from product to product 
research and development change research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with internal development of our technologies and our product candidates  manufacturing scale up and bioprocess development for our current products  and costs associated with research activities performed on behalf of our collaborators 
we track our researchers time by type of project 
however  we do not track other research and development costs by project  rather  we track such costs by the type of cost incurred 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel related costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on research activities funded by our collaborators and through grants  and that approximately were spent on internal product and technology development 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately of our research and development personnel related costs  based upon hours incurred  were spent on research activities funded by our collaborators and grants  and that approximately were spent on internal product and technology development 
research and development personnel related and unallocated costs incurred by type of project during the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands collaborations syngenta other total collaborations grants internal development unallocated our internal development costs relate primarily to early stage discovery of new enzymes  regulatory work for mid stage development products  and bioprocess development and technical support for late stage development 
we consider early stage projects to be those which are experimental in nature  and are often short lived 
we consider mid stage development products to be those that are potential candidates to advance to regulatory and commercialization stages 
we consider late stage products those that have been approved for their intended use by one or more regulatory agencies  have already been introduced commercially  or such commercial introduction is pending 
we estimate that our allocation of internal research and development personnel related costs during the years ended december  and was as follows in thousands early stage product development mid stage product development late stage product development r d support activities the decrease in our internal development costs was largely the result of our discontinuation of internally funded projects for our pharmaceutical programs due to our strategic reorganization in early our allocation of research and development resources varies from period to period and is largely dependent upon resources we have available over and above what is funded by our partners  however  we believe that our internal development projects are benefited to some extent by work we perform under our funded collaborative agreements 
research and development costs based upon type of cost incurred for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands personnel related laboratory and supplies outside services equipment and depreciation facilities  overhead and other scale up manufacturing costs share based compensation our research and development expenses decreased million to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  from million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributed in large part to a million decrease in personnel related costs for direct research and development  resulting primarily from our strategic reorganization announced in january of  pursuant to which we reduced our workforce by employees  comprised mostly of research and development employees 
our direct research and development staff decreased to full time employees at december  from at december  our facilities and overhead costs decreased by million  primarily related to our strategic reorganization in january our outside services  laboratories and supplies costs decreased in total by million due primarily to our discontinuation of internally funded projects for our pharmaceutical programs  as well as a decrease in third party costs incurred under our collaborations and grants 
these decreases were offset in part by million in scale up manufacturing costs related to our valley ultra thin and luminase pb enzyme products 
we have a limited history of developing commercial products 
we determine which products to pursue independently based on various criteria  including investment required  estimated time to market  regulatory hurdles  infrastructure requirements  and industry specific expertise necessary for successful commercialization 
successful products require significant development and investment prior to regulatory approval and commercialization 
as a result of the significant risks and uncertainties involved in developing and commercializing such products  we are unable to estimate the nature  timing  and cost of the efforts necessary to complete each of our major projects 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following our products may require more resources than we anticipate if we are technically unsuccessful in initial development or commercialization efforts 
the outcome of research is unknown until each stage of testing is completed  up through and including product trials and regulatory approvals  if needed 
it can take many years from the initial decision to perform research through development until products  if any  are ultimately marketed 
we have several product candidates in various stages of development related to collaborations and grants as well as internally developed products 
at any time  we may modify our strategy and pursue additional collaborations for the development and commercialization of some products that we had intended to pursue independently 
any one of these risks and uncertainties could have a significant impact on the nature  timing  and costs to complete our product development efforts 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and costs to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have any products approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies 
the various risks associated with our research and development activities are discussed more fully in this report under risk factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses change selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december   from million including share based compensation of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to share based compensation pursuant to the provisions of current accounting rules  as more fully described below 
amortization of acquired intangible assets we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily associated with our february acquisition of intellectual property rights licenses from syngenta  which we were amortizing over to years 
as more fully described below  we recorded an impairment charge related to our intangible assets during the fourth quarter of as a result of this write off  we recorded no amortization expense during non cash  share based compensation charges in january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including stock option grants  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure  which we previously used  is no longer an alternative 
prior to january   we accounted for share based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
under the provisions of apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized with respect to purchases of our common stock under the espp or when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant 
we recognized million  or per share  and million  or per share  in share based compensation expense for our share based awards during and these charges had no impact on our reported cash flows 
share based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands year ended december  research and development selling  general and administrative under the modified prospective method of transition under sfas no 
r  we are not required to restate our prior period financial statements to reflect expensing of share based compensation under the new standard 
therefore  the results for the are not comparable to the same periods in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded to all employees and officers under our stock option plan that had exercise prices greater than 
the unvested options to purchase approximately  shares became fully vested as of december  as a result of this acceleration 
these stock options would have all become fully vested before or during we accelerated these options because the options had exercise prices significantly in excess of then current market value at december   and thus were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention 
the acceleration eliminated future compensation expense we would otherwise have been required to recognize in our statements of operations with respect to these options with the implementation of sfas no 
r 
the future expense eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options was approximately million 
restructuring charges in connection with the decision to reorganize and refocus our resources  in january we commenced several cost containment measures  including a reduction in workforce of employees and the consolidation of our facilities 
we recorded charges of million in the first quarter of related to these activities  under the provisions set forth by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
during the first quarter of  we completed the employee termination activities under this restructuring and do not anticipate further payments or expenses related to employee separation under this program 
the facility consolidation costs are based on estimates that represent the discounted cash flow of lease payments net of anticipated sublease income on the vacated space through its contractual lease term in pursuant to current accounting rules  we are required to re assess these estimates on a periodic basis 
we recorded a million reversal of charges during the quarter ended june  and additional charges of million and million during the quarters ended september  and december   reflecting revisions in our estimates for our remaining net facilities consolidation costs 
we may further revise these estimates in future periods  which could give rise to additional charges or adjustments 
asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge for activities resulting from management s strategic decision to reorganize and refocus our resources to advance our most promising product candidates and programs that have the greatest near term opportunities 
as a result  in we recorded write downs to the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets considered non essential to our current focus  or otherwise deemed impaired under the provisions set forth by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these charges are summarized below in thousands year ended december  write off of intangible assets acquired in connection with fiscal transactions with syngenta excess or idle equipment costs write off of intellectual property licenses total we incurred no such impairment charges during interest and other income  net net interest and other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average rates of return on our investments  consistent with the increase in short term interest rates from to and a decrease in interest expense due to lower debt balances  both partially offset by a decrease in cash and investment balances during provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  we incurred net operating losses and  accordingly  did not record a provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  which will begin to expire in unless utilized 
our net operating loss carry forwards for state tax purposes were approximately million as of december   which will begin to expire in unless utilized 
we also had federal research credits of approximately million which will begin to expire in  california research credits of approximately million which will carry over indefinitely  and california manufacturer s investment credits of approximately million which will begin to expire in our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards and credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  funding from strategic partners and government grants  the issuance of convertible debt  and product sales 
as of december   our strategic partners have provided us more than million in funding since inception and are also committed to additional funding of more than million through subject to our performance under existing agreements  excluding milestone payments  license and commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing 
future committed funding is subject to our performance under existing agreements  and excludes milestone payments  license and commercialization fees  and royalties or profit sharing 
our future committed funding is concentrated within a limited number of collaborators 
our failure to successfully maintain our relationships with these collaborators could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately million 
our short term investments as of such date consisted primarily of us treasury and government agency obligations and investment grade corporate obligations 
historically  we have funded our capital equipment purchases through available cash  capital leases and equipment financing line of credit agreements 
capital requirements our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
we anticipate that our cash at december   together with the net proceeds from our sale of our new notes in february  may not be sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital beyond december without additional sources of cash 
this risk is attributable primarily to two factors uncertainties surrounding the additional capital requirements related to the completion  start up and commissioning of our demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facility 
we do not have fixed fee arrangements with our major engineering and construction firms  as such  most of our engineering and construction costs related to our demonstration plant are incurred and paid on a time and materials basis 
during and early  we have incurred costs in excess of our projected expenditures for the improvements to our pilot plant and construction of our demonstration plant 
we may continue to experience such overages during in excess of our budgeted expenditures 
minimum liquidity  working capital  and or market capitalization requirements under our existing bank debt agreement and facilities lease agreements 
as more fully described on page of this liquidity section  we may be required to secure certain unsecured obligations under our bank agreement and our facilities lease agreements if we fail to maintain certain minimum liquidity  working capital and or market capitalization thresholds 
this could encumber up to million of our cash  which is currently unrestricted 
while we believe that we will be successful in generating additional cash through a combination of corporate partnerships and collaborations  federal and state grant funding  and incremental product sales  if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources  we may need to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures 
although we do not presently intend to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund our operations in  we will continue to review our financing opportunities for suitable options 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to defer  reduce or eliminate our expenditures  secure additional sources of revenue or otherwise secure additional funding  we may need to restructure or significantly curtail our operations  file for bankruptcy or cease operations 
completion of convertible notes offering in late march and early april  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes  in a private placement  generating net cash proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  to permit registered resale of the notes and of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the notes bear interest at per year  payable in cash semi annually  and are convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase into shares of verenium common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate of the notes may be increased if the average price of the company s common stock for a period ending on april  is less than or in certain circumstances if a holder surrenders notes for conversion in connection with a make whole fundamental change that occurs before april  on or after april   the company may  at its option  redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on each of april   april  and april   holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date 
holders may also require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
pursuant to the terms of the notes  a fundamental change is broadly defined as a change in control  or a termination of trading of our common stock 
we have used a significant portion of the proceeds of this offering to make enhancements to our pilot facility and continue construction and development of our demonstration scale facility in jennings  louisiana  to commercialize our specialty enzymes products  to continue our research and development efforts in both specialty enzymes and biofuels  and for expenses related to our merger with celunol  all of which have adversely affected  and will continue to adversely affect  our operating results until revenues from our specialty enzymes business and our biofuels business reach levels at which we can fully support our operating and capital expenditures 
as described below  in connection with our recent private placement of new convertible notes  we entered into exchange agreements with certain noteholders  representing million in aggregate principal of the existing convertible senior notes 
completion of convertible notes offering on february   we completed a private placement of senior convertible notes due april   or the new notes  and warrants to purchase our common stock 
concurrent with entering into the purchase agreement  we also entered into senior notes exchange agreements with certain existing holders of our notes pursuant to which such noteholders exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the new notes and for warrants to purchase common stock 
including the new notes to be issued in exchange for the notes  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of the new notes and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
gross proceeds from new investment were approximately million and net proceeds from new investment  after giving effect to payment of certain transaction related expenses and the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction described below  were approximately million 
the new notes will be convertible on the date of their issuance 
their initial conversion price will be equal to per share 
the conversion price will be subject to full ratchet anti dilution protection and a reset provision whereby  to the extent the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the seven trading days prior to the one year anniversary of the issuance of the new notes s is less than per share  the conversion price will reset to the greater of per share or of the volume weighted average price of the common stock at that time 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including that an effective resale registration statement for the applicable shares be on file  interest payments on the new notes may be made  at our option  in shares of common stock  valued at a discount to the stock price at the time of payment of the interest 
in the event that we do not receive shareholder approval for issuances of shares beyond of the number of our issued and outstanding shares as of february   any required share issuances under the new notes in excess of that amount will be settled for cash in an amount per share equal to the closing sales price of our common stock on the conversion date 
the new notes are subject to automatic conversion at our option if our closing stock price exceeds per share over a trading day period ending prior to the date we provides notice of the automatic conversion to investors  the average daily trading volume of our stock over that trading day period equals or exceeds million  and certain other conditions are met 
the warrants are exercisable six months after their issuance 
the initial exercise price of the warrants will be per share 
the exercise price will be subject to weighted average anti dilution protection 
we are not permitted to issue shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants unless and until we receive shareholder approval for such issuances 
if such shareholder approval is obtained  the warrants  beginning six months after their issuance  will be exercisable for shares of our common stock 
if such shareholder approval is not obtained  the warrants will never be exercisable for shares of common stock and will only be settled for cash on exercise in an amount per share issuable equal to the closing sales price of our common stock on the exercise date less the applicable warrant exercise price 
in connection with the transactions described above  we entered into a convertible hedge transaction with a counterparty  which is intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the new notes 
the convertible hedge transaction is composed of two separate call options 
under the first call option  on april  or earlier upon conversion of the new notes  we will be entitled to purchase  shares of our common stock from the counterparty at a price per share equal to the initial conversion price or a proportion of such number of shares based on the proportion of the senior convertible notes being converted 
under the second call option  on three exercise dates staggered in six month intervals beginning on october   the counterparty will be entitled to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
the cash cost of the convertible hedge transaction was approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the new notes and warrants for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the completion of construction  commissioning and start up of our cellulosic ethanol demonstration facility 
the following table summarizes our principal and interest obligations upon completion of the convertible notes offering on february  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible notes convertible notes total principal and interest obligations principal and interest payments include the effects of the february  senior notes exchange agreements with certain noteholders whom exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the new notes which reduced our semi annual interest payments on the notes to million from million and reduced our principal amount on the notes to million from million 
balance sheet our consolidated assets have increased by million  from million at december  to million at december   attributable primarily to the following goodwill of million  which was recorded in connection with our merger with celunol corp  as more fully described on page of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and an increase in net property  plant  and equipment of million related primarily to capital expenditures for our pilot and demonstration facilities for our biofuels business segment  as more fully described on page of this liquidity section 
our consolidated liabilities have increased by million  from million at december  to million at december   attributable primarily to the following debt of million related to our convertible senior notes offering  as more fully described on page of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and an aggregate increase of million in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued compensation related primarily to our increased operating and capital expenditures in connection with our biofuels business segment 
cash flows related to operating  investing and financing activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  our cash used by operating activities consisted primarily of cash used to fund our net loss of million  as well as million we paid in merger related transaction costs 
our use of cash was offset in part by the following non cash charges in thousands acquired in process research and development share based compensation depreciation and amortization our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december  our investing activities consisted primarily of advances of million made to celunol corp  prior to our merger on june   which were used for the construction of the demonstration plant and normal operating activities  and purchase of property and equipment of million  partially offset by cash generated through net maturities of short term investments of million to fund operations 
our financing activities generated net cash of million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of net proceeds from our convertible notes offering 
we are currently in the process of making further modifications and improvements to our pilot facility and constructing our demonstration scale cellulosic ethanol facility in jennings  louisiana 
during  the celunol and verenium spent in excess of million on these projects in jennings  and we estimate that the total additional capital expenditures required to complete these projects will be in the range of million to million through mechanical completion  commissioning and start up of our demonstration facility in the first half of we do not have fixed fee arrangements with our major engineering and construction firms  as such  most of our engineering and construction costs related to our demonstration plant are incurred and paid on a time and materials basis 
during and early  we have incurred costs in excess of our projected expenditures for the improvements to our pilot plant and construction of our demonstration plant 
we may continue to experience such overages during contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   excluding our convertible notes principal and interest payments shown above as of february  to reflect the effects of the convertible notes exchange in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt  including capital leases operating leases manufacturing costs to fermic purchase commitment license and research agreements total contractual obligations operating lease obligations are shown net of million in sublease rental income that we expect to receive through february   pursuant to a facilities sublease agreement we entered into during the fourth quarter of pursuant to our manufacturing agreement with fermic  we are obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
as of december   under this agreement we have made minimum commitments to fermic of approximately million  over the next three years 
in august  celunol corp 
entered into a commitment to purchase a piece of equipment for the demonstration plant in the amount of million  of which million was paid upon signing the agreement and an additional million upon shipment which occurred in september the remaining balance of million is to be paid ratably over the month period beginning january and is included in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  manufacturing and supply agreements during  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with fermic to provide us with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of certain enzyme products 
based on actual and projected increased product requirements  the agreement was amended in to provide for additional capacity to be installed over the next two years 
under the terms of the agreement  we can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice provided that the term of the agreement  including the termination notice period  aggregates four years 
pursuant to our agreement with fermic  we are also obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities 
these costs scale up as our projected manufacturing volume increases 
as of december   under this agreement we have made minimum commitments to fermic of approximately million  over the next three years 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  we are required to purchase certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream processing of the products 
through december   we had incurred costs of approximately million for equipment related to this agreement 
during  we anticipate funding as much as million in additional equipment costs related to our manufacturing agreement with fermic 
as we continue to develop our commercial manufacturing platforms  we will be required to purchase additional capital equipment under this agreement 
our supply agreement with danisco for phyzyme contains provisions which allow danisco  with six months advance notice  to assume of the right to manufacture phyzyme 
if danisco were to exercise this right  we would likely experience significant excess capacity at fermic 
if danisco assumed the right to manufacture phyzyme and we were unable to absorb the excess capacity at fermic with other products  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely effected 
bank debt on september   we entered into a million loan and security agreement the bank agreement with a commercial bank the bank 
the bank agreement provided for a one year credit facility for up to million in financing for qualified equipment purchases in the united states and mexico the equipment advances and a million letter of credit sub facility the letter of credit sublimit 
the bank agreement was amended in october to increase the letter of credit sublimit to million 
borrowings under the equipment advances are structured as promissory notes which are secured by qualified equipment purchases and repaid over to months  depending on the location of the equipment financed 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  plus 
on september   our draw down period under the equipment advances expired 
the bank agreement contains standard affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions on actions by us including  but not limited to  activity related to common stock repurchases  liens  investments  indebtedness  and fundamental changes in  or dispositions of  our assets 
we may take certain of these actions with the consent of the bank 
on february   we executed an amendment to the bank agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  in exchange for the bank s consent to the private placement of our new notes and warrants  we agreed to expand the scope of the security interest under the loan and security agreement to include substantially all of our assets excluding our intellectual property 
in return  the bank modified our minimum cash covenant to reduce the required minimum liquidity from million to an amount equal to of the total amount of our obligations to the bank under the bank agreement 
at december   there was approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the equipment advances and a letter of credit for approximately million under the letter of credit sublimit  as required under our facilities leases 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our various financing agreements 
letter of credit pursuant to our facilities leases for our office and laboratory space in san diego  we are required to maintain a letter of credit on behalf of our landlord in lieu of a cash deposit 
the total amount required under the letter of credit is based on minimum required working capital and market capitalization  as follows working capital market capitalization required letter of credit greater than million n a million to million or million  plus months rent less than million and less than million  plus months rent currently  and as of december   we have an unsecured letter of credit in place pursuant to this agreement for approximately million  representing the  minimum and approximately months current rent 
the letter of credit is issued under our existing bank agreement as described above 
any increases to our letter of credit resulting from increases in rent or changes in our working capital or market capitalization are effective upon notice to us by our landlord 
as of december   our working capital was approximately million and our market capitalization was approximately million 
based on this  and pursuant to our lease agreement  upon notice by our landlord we would be required to increase our letter of credit by approximately million  to approximately million 
however  upon receipt of the net cash proceeds from our debt offering in february  our working capital increased to more than million and  as a result  our required letter of credit remains at its current level 
during  if our market capitalization remains below million and our working capital declines below million  we will be obligated to increase our letter of credit to approximately million 
if we are unable to secure additional amounts for an unsecured letter of credit under our existing bank agreement  or new financing arrangements  we may be required to secure the additional obligation with cash 
off balance sheet arrangements except as described above  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would give rise to additional material contractual obligations as of december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as of december   the company recorded million of goodwill on its balance sheet  resulting from its recent merger with celunol corp  as more fully described in note  merger transaction 
we record goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment tests 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
we assess goodwill for potential impairments an at least on annual basis 
we perform this analysis on october of each year 
if goodwill is deemed impaired  losses could be recorded in future periods 
revenue recognition we follow the provisions as set forth by current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue when we have satisfied all contractual obligations and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue under current accounting rules 
in those instances where we have billed our customers or received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue  we include the amounts in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we generate revenue from research collaborations generally through funded research  up front fees to initiate research projects  fees for exclusivity in a field  and milestones 
we recognize revenue from research funding on a proportional performance basis  as research hours are incurred under each agreement 
we recognize fees to initiate research over the life of the project 
we recognize revenue from exclusivity fees over the period of exclusivity 
our collaborations often include contractual milestones 
when we achieve these milestones  we are entitled to payment  as defined by the underlying agreements 
we recognize revenue for milestone payments when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv our past research and development services  as well as our ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration  are charged at fees that are comparable to the fees that the we customarily charges for similar research and development services 
we recognize revenue from grants as related costs are incurred  as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying grant agreements 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of our inventory as we ship or deliver products  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue from products sold through distributors or other third party arrangements upon shipment of the products  if the distributor has a right of return  provided that a the price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale  b the distributor s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of the products  c title and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment  d the distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by us  e we have no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products  and f future returns can be reasonably estimated 
for any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria  revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met 
we include our profit sharing revenues in product revenues on the statement of operations 
we recognize profit sharing revenues during the quarter in which such profit sharing revenues are earned based on calculations provided by our profit sharing partner 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our product revenues  including profit sharing revenues  through our agreements with danisco 
we sometimes enter into revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as we are able to determine a separate value for each element  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
share based compensation effective january   we calculate the fair value of all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  non restricted and restricted shares  and awards issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and amortize these fair values to share based compensation in the income statement over the respective vesting periods of the underlying awards 
share based compensation related to stock options includes both the amortization of the fair value of options at the date of grant determined using black scholes merton bsm valuation model 
we amortize the fair value of options to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options 
share based compensation related to awards issued under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  after december  are based on calculations of fair value under the bsm valuation model which are similar to how stock option valuations are made 
we amortize the fair value of espp awards to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards and awards under the espp on the date of grant using assumptions about volatility  expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield rate 
the expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted  based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options 
the expected life of the options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees 
the expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical payments and management s intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion 
we estimate the fair value of non restricted and restricted stock awards based upon the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we charge the fair value of non restricted awards to share based compensation upon grant 
we amortize the fair value of restricted awards to share based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards 
convertible debt and derivative accounting we perform an assessment of all embedded features of a debt instrument to determine if such features should be bifurcated and separately accounted for  and  if bifurcation requirements are met  whether such features should be classified and accounted for as equity or liability 
under equity accounting  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially and included in stockholders equity  and remeasurement is not required 
under liability accounting  the fair value of the embedded feature is measured initially  included as a liability on the balance sheet  and remeasured each reporting period 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations 
we monitor  on an on ongoing basis  whether events or circumstances could give rise to a change in our classification of embedded features 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
this requires us to estimate future cash flows related to these assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which may affect the carrying amount of assets and the related amortization expense 
income taxes effective in  we account for income taxes pursuant fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax return 
under fin  we do not recognize an uncertain tax position as a deferred tax asset if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january   and commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
as a result of adoption  we have recorded no additional tax liability 
as of december  we have not yet completed our analysis of our deferred tax assets for net operating losses of million and research and development credits of million generated in years prior to and net operating losses of million and research and development credits of generated in as such  we have removed these amounts and the offsetting valuation allowance has been removed from our deferred tax assets 
we are in the process of completing a section analysis regarding the limitation of the net operating loss and research and development credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we had million in gross deferred tax assets  excluding any estimated deferred tax assets related to our nol s and r d credits 
our deferred tax assets at december  were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value and  if necessary  reduce the value by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the determination of the need for an allowance is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  as well as  judgments  quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
capitalized interest we capitalize interest on capital projects  namely our cellulosic ethanol demonstration facility  commencing with the first expenditure for the project and continuing until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we amortize the capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight line method over the same lives as the related assets 
recently issued accounting standards information with respect to recent accounting standards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of high grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and debt obligations of various governmental agencies 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of the debt instruments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
as of december   we had outstanding debt obligations of million  including million of convertible senior notes 
as of december   the fair value of these notes was approximately million 
foreign currency exposure we engage third parties  including fermic  our contract manufacturing partner in mexico city  to provide various services 
from time to time certain of these services result in obligations that are denominated in other than us dollars 
foreign currency risk is minimized because the amount of such obligations is not material
