overview the company our research and development r d programs are focused on identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
since we relocated our corporate headquarters and research laboratories to california in our r d efforts have primarily been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and human liver engrafting cells hlec and developing these as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns and the liver  respectively 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells as a treatment for infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  a fatal neurodegenerative disease often referred to as batten disease 
we have completed enrollment and dosing for this six patient trial and expect it to be completed in early our cns program is continuing basic research and preclinical development for additional potential indications in the cns field 
we are targeting to initiate clinical trials to test our hucns sc product candidate for a spinal cord indication by mid and for a myelin disorder in the brain by the end of in our liver program  we are in preclinical development with our human liver engrafting cells and are exploring their applicability as a cellular therapy to restore function to liver tissue by replacing dysfunctional or damaged cells 
see overview research and development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k for a brief description of our significant research and development programs 
we have also conducted research on several other cell types and in other areas  which could lead to other possible product candidates  process improvements or further research activities 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented cells and media for use in research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv pursue required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this 
table of contents time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 
given the early stage of development of our product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc and hlec technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
significant events in january  we completed enrollment and dosing of a six patient phase i clinical trial of our hucns sc product candidate as a treatment for infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl at oregon health science university ohsu doernbecher children s hospital 
in january  we entered into a research collaboration with the ohsu casey eye institute to evaluate our hucns sc product candidate as a potential treatment for retinal degeneration  a leading cause of blindness 
in december  we announced that we were exploring the possible acquisition of privately held progenitor cell therapy  llc pct  a provider of cgmp quality cell processing services headquartered in hackensack  nj 
pct agreed to a period of exclusivity to allow for due diligence and negotiations  and in consideration thereof  we agreed to make a secured loan of up to million to pct  of which million was lent 
in march  we terminated discussions to acquire pct because the parties were unable to reach mutually agreeable terms and conditions 
we anticipate the million loan will be repaid in accordance with its terms 
in september  we entered into a research collaboration with belgium s universit catholique de louvain ucl and the ucl affiliated cliniques universitaires saint luc to further the development of hlec as a potential cell based liver therapy 
under the collaboration  we are working with ucl to improve processes to isolate and purify hlec  which we believe is an important step prior to initiating any clinical study of the cells 
in june  we announced that we had successfully completed enrollment and dosing of the low dose cohort in our phase i trial 
a review of the trial data to that point  conducted by an independent data safety monitoring committee comprised of experts in pediatric neurosurgery  pediatric neurology  solid organ transplantation  and genetics  identified no safety issues to preclude advancing to the next dose level 
in june  we announced the publication of a paper describing a new technique for non invasive tracking of human neural stem cells transplanted into the brains of mice 
the technique  which involves tagging the human neural stem cells with feridex  a commonly used magnetic resonance imaging agent approved by the fda for use in humans  does not appear to alter the stem cells function or viability 
in february  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  ordinary shares of reneuron group plc 
we received the shares as part of a license and settlement agreement we entered into with reneuron in in which we granted reneuron a license under some of our patents to exploit their conditionally immortalized adult human neural stem cell technology for therapy and other purposes 

table of contents in january  desmond h 
o connell  jr  joined our board of directors 
currently an independent management consultant and private investor  mr 
o connell is a director of abiomed  inc and was formerly a director  acting chief executive officer and chairman of the board of serologicals corporation until that company was sold in critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options 
under the provisions of sfas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term of the option 
under this method  the expected term is the average of the contractual life of the option and its vesting period 
as required under sfas r  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
for the year ended december   employee stock based compensation expense was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
wind down expenses in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through to the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking account of changes  if any  in each underlying factor 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections over time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 

table of contents management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the leasehold to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last five years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be for  and approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
if the assumed vacancy rate for to the end of the lease had been five percentage points higher or lower at december   then the reserve would have increased or decreased by approximately  similarly  a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from on would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  and a increase or decrease in the assumed average rental charge per square foot would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve to  at december  by recording an additional  for the year ended december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb staff position no 
fin 
under sfas and fin  we must recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 

table of contents we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k for further information on these matters 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  and the increasing costs associated with operating our california facility 
to expand and provide high quality systems and support to our research and development programs  we will need to hire more personnel  which will lead to higher operating expenses 
revenue revenue totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in change in versus versus revenue licensing agreements and grants the decrease in licensing and grant revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the completed draw down in of a  small business technology transfer grant for studies in alzheimer s disease that was awarded in september the grant supported joint work with dr

table of contents operating expenses operating expense totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in change in versus versus operating expenses research development general administrative wind down expenses total expense research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as toxicology studies  certain patent related costs such as licensing  facilities related costs such as depreciation  lab equipment and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cell  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of our investigational new drug ind application for our phase i trial for ncl to the fda  and obtaining fda clearance  and iii expenditures in connection with our hucns sc phase i clinical trial 
we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects 
lastly  much of our r d effort is focused on manufacturing processes  which can result in process improvements useful across cell types 
we also use external service providers to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials  to manufacture certain of our product candidates and to provide various other r d related products and services 
many of these costs and expenses are complementary to and supportive of each of our programs 
because we do not have a development collaborator for any of our product programs  we are currently responsible for all costs incurred with respect to our product candidates 
r d expense totaled approximately  in  as compared to  in and  in at december   we had full time employees working in research and development and laboratory support services as compared to at december  and at december  versus the increase of approximately  or  from to was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of our operations in cell processing and clinical development  including an increase in external services and clinical study costs of approximately  and an increase in personnel costs of approximately  of which approximately  was attributable to stock based compensation expense

the reserve has been re evaluated and adjusted based on assumptions relevant to real estate market conditions and the estimated time until we could either fully sublease  assign or sell our remaining interests in the property 
the reserve was approximately  at december  and  at december  payments net of subtenant income were recorded against this reserve of  in   in  and  in we re evaluated the estimate and adjusted the reserve by recording in aggregate  additional wind down expenses of  in   in  and  in expenses for this facility will fluctuate based on changes in tenant occupancy rates and other operating expenses related to the lease 
even though it is our intent to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interests in the facility at the earliest possible time  we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur 
in light of this uncertainty  based on estimates  we will periodically re evaluate and adjust the reserve  as necessary

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas is expected to expand the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require certain assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas  a company may choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  share based payment sab  which amends sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method in sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december is permitted only for companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for employee option grants as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
sab is effective for employee options granted after december  we intend to adopt sab effective january  and we are currently assessing our historical experience to evaluate if it can provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for employee option grants
