item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe that coast is one of the largest wholesale suppliers of replacement parts  supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles rvs  and boats in north america 
we supply more than  products and serve more than  customers throughout the united states and canada  from regional distribution centers in the united states and regional distribution centers in canada 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products our sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom after market customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
as a result  recessionary conditions and increases in interest rates often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increases in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats  because these conditions increase the consumers costs and the difficulties of using their rvs and boats 
weather conditions also can affect our operating results  because unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions can reduce the usage of rvs and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions and can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline and unusually adverse weather conditions 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides income statement data for the fiscal years ended december   and  and compares our operating results in each of and to the prior year s operating results 
dollars are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease vs 
vs 
amount amount amount amount percent amount percent net sales gross profits selling  general administrative expenses operating income interest expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings net earnings per share diluted 
table of contents as the above table indicates  operating income and net income declined significantly in from those declines were primarily attributable to the following factors decrease in net sales 
net sales declined by in primarily as a result of a reduction in the usage and purchases  by consumers  of rvs and boats in response to i substantial increases in gasoline prices  particularly during the spring and summer months when usage of rvs and boats is usually at its highest  ii increases in interest rates during the first half of  which made the purchase of rvs and boats more expensive  and iii a slowing economy and increasing concerns about the onset of a possible economic recession  that led to a decline in consumer confidence and  in turn  caused consumers to curtail discretionary spending 
the decrease in sales of traditional rv and boating products was partially offset by increased sales of our proprietary and foreign sourced products 
gross margin and gross profits 
we were able to maintain our gross margin in at  down only slightly from in  primarily as a result of i increases in sales of our proprietary and foreign sourced products  on which we are able to realize higher margins than on sales of traditional rv and boating products  ii price increases on selected products  and iii the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
nevertheless  gross profits declined by in  as compared to  due primarily to the decline in net sales in increase in selling general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by in  primarily due to increases in marketing and selling expenses and in the costs of adding engineering and quality control personnel  to support the growth of our proprietary products business 
interest expense 
interest expense increased in due to i increases during the first half of in market rates of interest  which determine the rate of interest on our credit line borrowings  and ii higher average credit line borrowings  which were used primarily to increase our inventory of products that we source from the far east and have been introducing  on an increasing basis  into the market 
outlook for the relatively high gasoline prices  a continued slowing of the economy and concerns and uncertainties regarding the duration of what now appears to be a severe economic slowdown in the united states have continued into we expect that these conditions will continue to adversely affect purchases and usage by consumers of rvs and boats throughout the remainder of and  therefore  the need for and purchases by consumers of the products that we sell 
our strategic goals for are to capture additional market share and to improve our gross margin  despite these market conditions  primarily by continuing to increase our sales of proprietary products and other foreign sourced products 
we generally are able to realize higher margins on sales of proprietary products  which we believe have gained greater acceptance among users of rvs and boats during the past three years 
no assurance can be given  however  that we will be able to achieve these goals because  as is described above under the caption factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products  and in item a of this report  entitled risk factors  our sales and profitability can be affected by a number of conditions that are outside of our control 
additionally  the higher costs of marketing  testing and servicing our line of generator products  as well as new proprietary products that we will be sourcing from the far east  could offset the positive effects of any increases in sales of those higher margin products 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including judgments or assumptions we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance  and those judgments and assumptions are  in turn  based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then  based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the 
table of contents prospects for realizing the values at which we have recorded these assets  we may be required  pursuant to gaap  to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and an allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the amounts at which those allowances are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
those allowances are periodically increased to replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic slowdowns  will be of short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes  for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
see consolidated financial statements report of independent registered public accounting firm in item of this report 
our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit products for return 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events that require such increases 
table of contents become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
allowance for deferred income taxes 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions that can be applied in future periods to offset or reduce our future income tax liability 
at december  the aggregate amount of that deferred tax asset was approximately million 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to use this deferred tax asset depends on the taxable income that we are able to generate during those time periods 
we have made a judgment  based on historical experience and current and anticipated market and economic conditions and trends  that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully use the deferred tax asset that is recorded in our financial statements 
however  if due to future events or circumstances  we subsequently come to a different conclusion regarding our ability to fully utilize this asset  we would create a valuation allowance in order to reduce the amount at which we record the deferred tax asset to the amount we believe we will be able to fully utilize 
the creation of such an allowance would be effectuated by an increase in the provision or a reduction in the credit for income taxes in our statement of income  which would have the effect of reducing our income in the fiscal period in which such provision is recorded 
long lived and intangible assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and certain types of identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  based on standards established by sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
in the event that we were to determine that the fair value of the asset has declined below its carrying value  we would be required to reduce the value at we record the asset on our balance sheet to its fair value through a charge to earnings 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement sfas r  share based payment sfas r effective on january  sfas r established standards in accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  such as the options issued under the company s stock incentive plans 
sfas r provides for  and we elected to adopt  the modified prospective method for applying sfas r 
under that method  we began recognizing compensation cost on january  for the fair value of i all share based award grants made on or after such date and ii the portion of pre existing awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of january   in each case based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
our stock option compensation expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents prior to january  we had elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in the statement of earnings included in these consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  relating to stock based awards to employees granted prior to january  when the exercise price of those awards was equal to or greater than the quoted market price on the date of the grant 
warranty costs 
we generally do not independently warrant the products that we distribute 
instead  in almost all cases  the manufacturers of the products that we distribute warrant the products and allow us to return defective products  including those that have been returned to us by our customers 
however  in the last quarter of  we began selling a line of portable and standby generators under a product supply arrangement which obligates us to provide warranty services for these products and to share the costs of providing those services with the manufacturer 
the warranty period for these products is for months following the sale of the product to a retail customer 
in  we did not have sufficient experience with these products to be able to predict  with accuracy  the warranty costs that we might incur under this arrangement and  as a result  we had not yet established any reserves for such costs or for possible warranty claims that might have been made with respect to these products 
in the fourth quarter of  we had sufficient history on the type of warranty claims and the cost of those claims to reasonably estimate future claims on these products 
accordingly  we established a warranty reserve for these products of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the actual amounts that we may become obligated to pay with respect to warranty claims on these products may differ from the amounts that were set aside in those reserves 
in the event that the estimates on which the reserves were based later prove to be incorrect due to increases in the number or amounts of the warranty claims we receive  it could become necessary for us to increase the reserve by means of a charge to our income 
increases in sales of these products in the future also may necessitate increases in our warranty reserve 
adoption of fin in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company adopted fin effective january  in accordance with fin  the company decided to classify interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
the company recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the implementation of fin at its adoption date of january   the company had  of unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized  they will impact the company s effective tax rate 
at december   the company had  of unrecognized tax benefits of which  impacted the effective tax rate in interest and penalties were  as of december   of which  was included in the balance sheet and  was included as an expense in the current year income statement as unrecognized tax benefits

sfas no 
provides a new single authoritative definition of fair value and provides enhanced guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosures related to the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
was to become effective for us as of january  however  at the february  meeting  the fasb agreed to defer for one year the effective date of sfas no for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually

sfas provides entities with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
business entities adopting sfas will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date on items for which fair value option has been elected 
sfas established presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires additional information that will help investors and other financial statements users to understand the effect of an entity s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas will become effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted

results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  derived from our statements of income for the respective periods indicated below year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses operating income interest expense earnings before taxes income tax expense net earnings net sales net sales consist of revenues from the sales of the products we supply or distribute  net of an allowance for product returns 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the increases in net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal dollars in the table are in thousands 
change vs 
change vs 
the decline in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to an industry wide decline in usage and purchases  by consumers  of rvs and boats that  in turn  adversely affected the demand for our products from our after market customers 
we believe that this decline was primarily attributable to high gasoline prices  shortages in available financing of rvs and boats  and uncertainties and concerns about the direction of the economy  which led consumers to curtail discretionary expenditures 
the increase in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to increase in sales of our proprietary and foreign sourced products  largely the kipor line of portable and standby generators  for which we hold exclusive distribution rights in north america 
those increase more than offset the effects of the industry wide decline in the purchase and usage of rvs and boats by consumers and the consequent decline in sales of rv and boating products of the type we sell 

table of contents gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of sales from net sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  and warehouse and distribution costs  including warehouse labor costs and freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin in  we were able to maintain our gross margin at  almost unchanged from our gross margin of in  primarily due to i increased sales of products sourced from the far east  on which we realize higher margins than on competing products available from traditional sources  ii price increases implemented on selected products in the second half of  and iii the strengthening of the canadian dollar  which enabled our canadian subsidiary  which purchases products from suppliers in the united states  to improve its margins 
these factors largely offset the effect on margins of increased freight and shipping costs 
however  due primarily to the decline in net sales in  gross profits declined by million or in  as compared to in our gross margin increased to  as compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to increase in sales of our proprietary and other foreign sourced products including  in particular  the kipor generator products  on which we realize higher gross margins than on traditional rv and boating products 
the effect of this change in product mix more than offset an increase in freight and shipping costs and warranty costs associated with the sale of the generators 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  selling and administrative labor and other administrative costs  professional fees  insurance and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
also included in sg a expense  in and  was stock based compensation expense  attributable to the grant and vesting of employee stock options  which was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r 
such expense was not required to be and was not recorded in our income statement in year ended december  dollars in thousands sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales sg a expenses increased by  or in  due primarily to increases in labor costs associated with sales  design  engineering and quality control personnel for our proprietary and foreign sourced products 
also contributing to the increase were legal expenses  and expenses relating to the documentation and testing of the company s internal controls systems as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which became applicable to the company effective as of december  sg a expenses increased by  or in  primarily due to increases in labor  both selling and administrative  and increases in insurance premiums and legal and accounting expenses 
the increased labor costs were largely attributable to increased sales  quality control  design and administrative personnel to support sales and the design  development  quality and servicing of the proprietary and imported products  such as the kipor generators  that we sell 
also contributing to that increase in sg a expense was stock based compensation expense of  no such expense was recorded in 
table of contents the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income as a percentage of net sales the decrease in operating income in  as compared to  was due primarily to the above described declines in net sales and gross profits  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in operating income in  as compared to  was due primarily due to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which more than offset the increases in net sales and gross margin in other income expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense other income expense total as a percentage of net sales interest expense is the largest component of other income expense and is incurred on the borrowings that we make under our revolving bank line of credit 
interest expense increased by  or in  and by  or  in  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the increase in was due primarily to increases in average borrowings under our long term credit facility and  to a lesser extent  to increases in the first half of in prevailing market rates of interest  on which the interest rate on our borrowings is based 
the increase in was the result of higher rates of interest charged on borrowings under our bank line of credit  due primarily to increases in prevailing market rates of interest to which the interest rate on our borrowing is tied 
income tax provision year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  such as stock based compensation expense  and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
the respective decreases in the income tax provision in and  as compared to the prior year periods  were primarily attributable to decreases in taxable income in each of those years  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the increase in the effective tax rate in  as compared to  was due to the proportionally higher percentage of non deductible expenses to our pre tax earnings in as compared to the decrease in the effective tax rate in  as compared to  was due to a tax accrual for unremitted earnings of our foreign affiliate in taiwan in and to an increase in pre tax earnings of our subsidiary in canada in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  during the period from march through july  and  during the period from august through february  of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and between to of eligible inventory 
during  interest on the revolving credit facility was payable at the bank s prime rate or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at libor plus per annum 
pursuant to the terms of our credit line agreement  for the interest rate is equal to over the bank s prime rate  or libor plus per annum 
the revolving credit agreement with the bank contains certain restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with all the covenants as of december  the credit line is scheduled to mature in may at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness that the company may incur 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with  day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  certain of our customers receive payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
sources and uses of cash in cash provided by operations 
during  our operations provided net cash of million 
cash provided by operations was comprised of a million reduction in inventory  a million reduction in prepaid expenses  net profits of million  and nearly million of operating expenses that were non cash expenses 
cash used by operations was comprised of reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash used by financing activities 
during  we used nearly million of net cash for financing activities 
cash used in financing activities included million of cash to fund the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders and  to fund purchases under our stock repurchase program 
cash provided by financing activities was comprised of a net increase of  in credit line borrowings and  of proceeds from the sale of shares under our employee stock plans 
see trading market for our shares  other stockholder matters and repurchases of equity securities dividend policy share repurchases in item of part ii of this report  for information regarding our dividend policy and share repurchase program 
cash flows used in investing activities 
we used million of cash in investing activities in  principally to fund capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  testing and design and computer equipment 

table of contents contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments in thousands of dollars  as of december  year ending december  thereafter total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  maturities of contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations less than one year two to three years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations under letters of credit totals consists primarily of borrowings under our bank credit line  which matures in may dividend policy 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends of per share to our stockholders in march  june  september and december of each year 
pursuant to that policy we paid total cash dividends in of  in the first quarter of  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to per share 
in august  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to per share 
in and we paid total cash dividends of  and  respectively 
we expect to pay dividends of approximately  in which is calculated based on a quarterly dividend of per share and an estimated average number of shares outstanding of  share repurchases 
in  our board of directors adopted share repurchase programs authorizing repurchases by us of up to an aggregate of  of our shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
during  and  we made share repurchases totaling   and  respectively  pursuant to those programs 
we funded the share repurchases with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
expected uses and sources of funds we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range between  and  to upgrade our as computer and expand our product testing facilities in elkhart  indiana and wilsonville  oregon 
those expenditures will be in addition to capital expenditures of a recurring nature  for such purposes as the replacement and upgrading of equipment  that we expect will range from  to  per year 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures and our working capital requirements  and to pay cash dividends with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds 

table of contents we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins 
we plan to establish new product supply relationships  including relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in china and other countries in the far east  and in canada  europe and the united states  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 
there is no assurance  however  that  if required for these purposes  we will be able to obtain additional bank borrowings 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
we generate significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august  when usage of rvs and boats are at their peak  than we do during the remainder of the year when weather conditions are not optimal for outdoor activities 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we sometimes incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when our sales are lower 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant
