item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our selected financial data and our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview and strategy we are a midland  texas based independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition  development and exploitation of long lived oil and natural gas reserves and  to a lesser extent  exploring for new oil and natural gas reserves 
the majority of our current producing properties are in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico  the fort worth basin of north texas  and the onshore gulf coast area of south texas 
our primary objective is to increase stockholder value by increasing reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we have shifted the balance of our investments from properties having high rates of production in early years to properties expected to produce more consistently over a longer term 
we attempt to reduce our financial risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for acquisitions  exploitation and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and natural gas reserves are given priority over properties that might provide more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
we also attempt to further reduce risk by emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
since the latter part of  we have reduced our emphasis on high risk exploration efforts and started focusing on established geologic trends where we can utilize the engineering  operational  financial and technical expertise of our entire staff 
although we expect to continue participating in exploratory drilling activities  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan focuses on projects having less geologic risk  emphasizes acquisition  exploitation  development and enhancement activities  includes the utilization of horizontal and fracture stimulation technologies on certain types of reservoirs  focuses on acquiring producing properties  and expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
although the direction of our exploration and development activities has shifted from higher risk exploratory activities to lower risk development opportunities  we will continue our efforts  as we have in the past  to maintain low general and administrative expenses relative to the size of our overall operations  utilize advanced technologies  serve as operator in appropriate circumstances  and reduce operating costs 
the extent to which we are able to implement and follow through with our business plan will be influenced by the prices we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce  the results of reprocessing and reinterpreting our d seismic data  the results of our drilling activities  the costs of obtaining high quality field services  
table of contents our ability to find and consummate acquisition opportunities  and our ability to negotiate and enter into work to earn arrangements  joint venture or other similar agreements on terms acceptable to us 
significant changes in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas  or the occurrence of unanticipated events beyond our control may cause us to defer or deviate from our business plan  including the amounts we have budgeted for our activities 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas and the quantities of oil and natural gas that we are able to produce 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
natural gas prices we receive are influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users  proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and world oil prices 
results of operations as described under item business about our business and strategy  we changed our business model in at the beginning of  our total proved reserves were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to through the execution of this business model  our reserves at the end of were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to as described on page of this annual report on form k  the failure to replace oil and natural gas reserves may negatively affect our business 
we monitor this risk by comparing the quantity of our oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each year to our production for that year 
this comparison  which is made in the form of a reserves to production ratio  helps us measure our ability to offset produced volumes with new reserves that will be produced in the future 
the reserves to production ratio is calculated by dividing the total proved reserves at the end of a year by the actual production for the same year 
the annual change in this ratio provides us with an indication of our performance in replenishing annual production volumes 
the reserves to production ratio is a statistical indicator that has limitations 
the ratio is limited because it can vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisitions 
in addition  the ratio does not take into account the cost or timing of future production of new reserves 
for that reason  the ratio does not  and is not intended to  provide a measurement of value 
for the year ended  our production was natural gas and oil  as compared to approximately natural gas and oil for the year ended december  the production stream changed from shorter lived gulf coast natural gas to longer lived permian basin oil production and longer lived natural gas production in the barnett shale and new mexico wolfcamp areas 
this has increased our lease operating expense primarily due to increased utilities and chemicals associated with the operation of oil properties and salt water disposal and compression associated with these longer lived resource gas projects

critical accounting policies and practices the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
our management reviews our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
full cost and impairment of assets 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties  net of related deferred taxes  is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling  based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of our unproved properties 
estimated future net revenues are measured at unescalated oil and natural gas prices at the end of each quarter  with effect given to our cash flow hedge positions 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to 
table of contents earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and may result in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in future periods 
depletion 
provision for depletion of oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves with oil and natural gas production being converted to a common unit of measurement based upon relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties subject to depletion 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage value 
oil and natural gas properties included million and million for and  respectively  for unevaluated properties not included in depletion 
in arriving at rates under the unit of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and require significant judgment as does the projection of future production volumes and levels of future costs  including future development costs 
in addition  considerable judgment is necessary in determining when unproved properties become impaired and in determining the existence of proved reserves once a well has been drilled 
all of these judgments may have significant impact on the calculation of depletion expense 
there have been no material changes in our methodology of calculating the depletion of oil and gas properties under the full cost method during the three years ended december  proved reserve estimates 
the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future revisions significantly reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling write down 
at december   our ceiling was in excess of our capitalized costs 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves in calculating the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculations of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while estimates of the quantities of proved reserves require substantial subjective judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on the last day of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs and certain hydrocarbon production expenses are the most critical estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 that requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  
table of contents during the period from january  to june   new derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts remained designated as cash flow hedges through their settlement 
accordingly  the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses was recorded in other comprehensive loss until the settlement of the contract position occurred 
at settlement of these contracts  the cash value paid was recorded in revenue along with oil and natural gas sales  or in interest expense along with the interest expense that we incurred under our credit facilities 
as of december   we had no remaining contracts which were designated as hedges 
for periods prior to and for periods after july   derivative contracts entered into were not designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the unrealized gain or loss on these derivative contracts was recorded in other income 
at settlement of these contracts  the realized gain or loss remains in other income and is not offset against oil and natural gas sales or interest expense 
although we have designated our derivative contracts differently in different periods  the purpose of all of our derivative contracts is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas receipts and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk under existing sales contracts 
years ended december  and december  our oil and natural gas revenues and production product mix are shown in the following table for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenues revenues production oil bbls natural gas mcf total includes the effects of derivative transactions accounted for as hedges 
the following table shows our production volumes  product sale prices and operating revenues for the periods indicated

includes hedge transactions 

table of contents oil revenues average wellhead realized crude oil prices increased per bbl  or  to per bbl for  as compared to this price increase caused our revenues to increase by approximately million in  as compared to oil production decreased attributable to a decline of approximately  bbls   bbls and  bbls in the diamond m deep  carm ann and south texas area  respectively comparing the twelve months ended december  to twelve months ended december  these decreases were as a result of natural declines and limited developmental activity occurring within these areas 
these decreases were partially offset with increases in the harris field where we benefited from our development programs in and late the decrease in oil production reduced revenue approximately million for natural gas revenues average realized wellhead natural gas prices received were up slightly to per mcf for the twelvemonths ended december  from per mcf received for the twelve months ended december  this slight price increase accounted for an increase in revenue of approximately  natural gas production increased primarily due to new wells in new mexico wolfcamp area where volumes were up bcf and the barnett shale area where volumes were up approximately  mcf 
these increases were offset by a production decline of approximately bcf in our south texas wells comparing twelve months ended december  to twelve months ended december  the net increase in natural gas volumes increased revenue approximately million for oil hedges we settled all remaining derivatives classified as cash flow hedges in december therefore  oil hedge losses were in compared to a loss of approximately million in we continue to employ derivative contracts in the form of oil and natural collars and swaps which are intended to mitigate the effects of commodity price volatility 
these derivative contracts are not designated or accounted for as cash flow hedges and  therefore  the changes in their fair values and any settlement amounts are recorded to other income expense as described below 
costs and expenses percent year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands lease operating expense production taxes production tax refund   n a general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization total lease operating expense lease operating expenses are higher partly due to new wells 
of the million increase  million of these charges are on wells that have been completed in the past year or completed late in therefore  the costs are higher for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period well repair  workover expenses  salt water disposal and compressor expense increased approximately million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  overall higher costs for well repair and workover result from our refocused efforts on lease maintenance and away from developmental activity during on our oil properties 
salt water disposal and compression charges increased significantly during resulting from new well activity in the south new mexico area and barnett shale area 
these amounts are included in the previously discussed million increase for new wells 
lifting costs excluding production taxes were per boe in compared to per boe in 
table of contents production taxes production taxes showed no significant change even though revenue increased million from december  to december  the expected increase was offset by qualifying lower severance tax rates used during the lower severance tax rates are a result of certain properties qualifying for state tax incentive programs 
the lower tax rates will continue on a forward basis until the term of the tax incentives are expired 
a production tax refund was received in june in the amount of million for gas production taxes on non operated wells in the wilcox area of south texas for production periods march through january this refund was received by the operator of these wells only after the operator s application for tax abatement was approved by state regulatory agencies 
the reduction in our production tax expense was recognized only when approval of the application for tax abatement was granted by the state 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased or  in over during  salaries increased by  this was due to a larger staff and increased salary rates when compared to also  we incurred increased legal fees in in the amount of  this increase in legal fees was primarily related to general corporate matters 
in addition  we incurred increased costs of  associated with accounting and reporting requirements 
although there can be no assurance  we do not expect legal  accounting and reporting costs to increase significantly in our insurance premiums increased by  offsetting the above general and administrative expense increases were the following two items 
first  during the second quarter of  we determined that stock options to purchase  shares of common stock had been granted in to four of our employees under our stock option plan  but which were not available for issuance under the plan 
in june  the board of directors authorized us to enter into settlement and release agreements with the four employees 
under these agreements  we made a one time lump sum cash payment to each employee in an amount equal to the spread between the exercise price of the options and the closing price of our stock on june  the total cash payments were approximately  this amount was charged to general and administrative expense during the second quarter of secondly  during the second quarter of  we revised our estimates of expected forfeitures of stock options granted to directors due to the resignation of a director and the subsequent forfeiture of  stock options held by him 
as a result we reduced our estimate of the grant date fair value of shares expected to ultimately vest under our stock option plan by approximately  depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased  or million  for as compared to depletion per boe was for and for this increase is attributable to an overall increase in actual and anticipated drilling costs and related oilfield service costs 
increased cost levels affect both the depletable amounts of capitalized costs in and the depletion attributable to amounts of estimated future development costs on proved undeveloped properties 
throughout and  the majority of our drilling activity was in our natural gas resource projects in the permian basin of west texas and the barnett shale areas 
these areas have higher associated per boe drilling and development costs due to the use of horizontal drilling and multi stage stimulation techniques 
these factors  when combined with the increase in the absolute level of our capital expenditures during this time period have led to a significant increase in our depletion rate per boe 

table of contents other income expense percent year ended december increase increase decrease decrease dollars in thousands gain loss on derivatives not classified as hedges gain loss on ineffective portion of hedges interest and other income interest expense cost of debt retirement n a other expense equity in income loss of pipelines and gathering system ventures total gain loss on derivatives not classified as hedges we recorded a loss of million in for derivatives not classified as hedges as compared to a gain of million for the greatest impact of the change in fair market valuation was within our crude oil contracts due to the significant increase in oil prices during we settled in cash a net of million in derivative contracts during the year 
the ineffective portion of our hedges was a gain of approximately  in as of december   all cash flow hedge contracts as defined by sfas were settled 
interest expense interest expense increased in as the result of increased borrowings and an increase in our weighted average interest rate 
our bank debt decreased from million to million during however  interest expense increased million as a result of our million senior notes offering in july and an increase in the average interest rate on our revolving credit facility in our weighted average interest rate increased to from for and  respectively 
due to the issuance of our senior notes  we expect that our average interest rate for will increase over the average 
capitalized interest on work in progress decreased interest expense by  in  a decrease of  compared to cost of debt retirement cost of debt retirement represent the write off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our second lien term loan that was retired with the proceeds of our senior notes offering 
equity in income loss of pipelines and gathering system ventures since  we have invested in four pipelines and gathering system joint ventures 
during  the assets of two of these ventures were sold 
as a result  we recognized our share of net gains on sale of million in during  we and two other unaffiliated parties formed a joint venture known as the hagerman gas gathering system  which was formed for the purpose of constructing  owning and operating a gas gathering system in new mexico 
the loss associated with our equity investments totaled  in versus a gain of million in the gains realized in were the result of the sale of our interests in two pipeline joint ventures 
we did not sell any interests in pipeline joint ventures during in addition  the hagerman gas gathering system in new mexico was operational for the entire twelve months of versus a few months in during and the first nine months  production levels and related transportation volumes were not sufficient for profitable operation of this system 
this resulted in an increase in our equity loss for this investment of  we also received final payout settlements for the divestiture of our investments in west fork pipeline company i and west fork pipeline company v of  and  respectively in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents income tax income tax was a benefit of million in compared to an expense of million in income tax expense for will be dependent on our earnings and is expected to be approximately of income before income taxes 
included in the million income tax benefit amount was a net state tax benefit of the  prior to  we had not recognized a tax credit for state net operating loss carryovers due to the uncertainty about their ultimate realization 
however  with the state of texas revising its state tax laws in and our election to utilize the credit  we recognized this credit as we now expect to realize this benefit over future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
basic and diluted net income we had basic net income loss per share of and and diluted net income loss per share of and for and  respectively 
basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased from approximately million shares in to approximately million shares in the increase was primarily due to our public offering of million shares of common stock in december and the exercise of employee and nonemployee stock options during years ended december  and december  our oil and natural gas revenues and production product mix are shown in the table below for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenues revenues production oil bbls natural gas m cf total includes hedge transactions

the increase in oil production increased revenue approximately million for average realized wellhead crude oil prices increased per bbl  or  to per bbl for  compared to the increase in oil price increased revenue approximately million for natural gas revenues natural gas revenues  excluding hedges  increased million  or  for the year ended  as compared to natural gas production volumes increased as a result of added production from drilling discoveries in our gulf coast area of south texas  fort worth basin barnett shale wells and initial production from our new mexico wolfcamp wells 
the increase in natural gas volumes increased revenue approximately million for average realized wellhead natural gas prices decreased  or per mcf  to per mcf 
the decrease in natural gas prices had a negative effect on revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  oil hedges the negative effect on oil revenues of oil hedges decreased approximately  or  for  as compared to  because contracts settled in had relatively higher strike prices in relation to the related market price at settlement

our increase in lease operating expenses is due to mechanical  ad valorem and utility costs which increased our related lifting costs excluding production taxes to per boe in  as compared to per boe in we experienced a increase in our per boe lifting costs primarily due to higher lifting costs associated with non operated wells and newly acquired operated wells for the year ended december  production taxes production taxes increased  or  million in  which was associated with an increase in revenues of million 
production taxes in future periods will continue to be a function of product mix  production volumes and product prices 
general and administrative total general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in over during the second quarter of  we determined that stock options to purchase  shares of common stock had been granted in to four of our employees under our stock option plan  but which were not available for issuance under the plan 
in june  the board of directors authorized us to enter into settlement and release agree 
table of contents ments with the four employees 
under these agreements  we made a one time lump sum cash payment to each employee in an amount equal to the spread between the exercise price of the options and the closing price of our stock on june  the total cash payments were approximately  this amount was charged to general and administrative expense during the second quarter of increased public reporting costs included  but were not limited to  increases in road show expenses  corporate counseling and oil and natural gas reserve analysis also contributed to the overall increases in general and administrative costs 
in addition  we incurred additional public reporting costs associated with the stock options granted to our board of directors in late general and administrative expenses capitalized to the full cost pool were million for  compared to million for depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased  or million  for compared to depletion per boe was for and for this increase is attributable to recent increases in overall drilling and related oilfield service costs and the costs of property acquisitions 
increased cost levels affect both the depletable amounts of capitalized costs in recent periods and the depletion attributable to amounts of estimated future development costs on proved undeveloped properties 
in addition  our drilling efforts in were  and our future drilling plans are  focused on our natural gas resource projects which have higher associated per boe drilling and development costs than our drilling projects in the permian basin of west texas and onshore gulf coast of south texas due to the use of horizontal drilling and multi stage stimulation techniques 
these factors  when combined with the increase in the absolute level of our capital expenditures during the recent period  have led to a significant increase in our depletion rate per boe 
our annual costs incurred in the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and natural gas properties have increased by approximately since other income expense percent year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease in thousands gain loss on derivatives not classified as hedges gain loss on ineffective portion of hedges interest and other income interest expense other expense equity in income loss of pipelines and gathering system ventures total gain loss on derivatives not classified as hedges we recorded a gain of million in for derivatives not classified as hedges in  as compared to a loss of million for future gains or losses on derivatives not classified as hedges will be impacted by the volatility of commodity prices and interest rates  as well as by the terms of any new derivative contracts 
the ineffective portion of our hedges was a gain of approximately  in  as compared to a loss of approximately  in as of december   all cash flow hedge contracts as defined by sfas were settled 
interest expense interest expense increased with the increase in our bank debt from million to million in  along with an increase of our average loan interest rate from to in interest expense will increase for with increased borrowings for leasehold acquisitions and amounts expended for drilling 
equity in income loss of pipelines and gathering system ventures we invested in four pipelines and gathering system joint ventures beginning in during  the assets of two of these ventures were sold 
as a result  we recognized our share of net gains on sale of million in 
table of contents income tax we had an income tax expense of million in  compared to a million income tax benefit in the income tax rate for will be dependent on our earnings and is expected to be approximately of income before income taxes 
basic and diluted net income we had basic and diluted net earnings per share of and  respectively  for and basic and diluted net loss per share of for basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased from million shares in to million shares in diluted weighted average common shares increased from million shares in to million shares in the increase in common shares was primarily due to our public offering of million shares of common stock in august capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  borrowings supported by our oil and natural gas reserves and equity offerings 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the prices we receive for oil and natural gas we produce 
working capital decreased approximately million as of december  compared with december  current liabilities exceeded current assets by at december  the working capital decrease was primarily due to the increase in obligations associated with crude oil derivative contracts 
in addition  our accounts payables have increased since last year as we have increased our drilling activity in the barnett shale area and due to the timing of payment of accrued interest associated with our senior notes 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided from operating activities in increased million over largely due to increased operating income which was offset partially with reductions in return on investment in pipelines and gathering system ventures 
cash used in investing activities decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of the completion of the harris field acquisition at the start of cash provided by financing activities decreased in compared to this is a result of increased cash flow provided in operations and a decrease in cash used in investing activities in the result of these two factors allowed the company to reduce its financing activities in historically  we have funded our operations  capital requirements and interest expense requirements with cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  borrowings and proceeds from sales of our equity securities 
although we expect these same capital resources to support our future activities  we continually review and consider alternative methods of financing 

table of contents senior notes offering on july   we completed a private offering of unsecured senior notes in the principal amount of million 
the net proceeds  after payment of typical transaction expenses  of the senior notes of approximately million were used first to retire all of our indebtedness under our second lien term loan agreement  with the remainder being applied to the repayment of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
shelf registration statement  common stock offering on november   the united states securities and exchange commission declared effective a shelf registration statement on form s filed by us to register million of securities for potential future issuance 
on december   we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and for conducting our exploitation  development and acquisition activities in certain core areas such as our permian basin properties and our barnett shale gas project 
the proceeds were not deployed all at once 
pending such use  we used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that the net proceeds will be available under our revolving credit facility as needed in the future to finance our exploitation  development and acquisition activities  subject to our compliance with provisions of our revolving credit facility that are conditions to loans and funding under our revolving credit facility and any recalculation of our borrowing base 
the available balance of our million universal shelf registration statement was million as of december  in the future  we may  in one or more offerings  offer and sell debt securities and additional equity securities under our shelf registration statement 
revolving credit facility our third amended and restated credit agreement  or the revolving credit agreement  with a group of bank lenders provides us with a revolving line of credit having a borrowing base limitation of million at december  the total amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of million or the borrowing base established by the lenders 
at december   the principal amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was million  excluding  reserved for our letters of credit 
we have pledged substantially all of our producing and natural gas properties to secure the repayment of our indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement allows us to borrow  repay and reborrow amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the lenders semi annually on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the lenders or at our request 
if  as a result of the lenders redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loans exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the lenders or repay the outstanding principal of our loans in an amount equal to the excess 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
loans made to us under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate of citibank  na or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  citibank s base rate is equal to its prime rate as announced from time to time by citibank 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered in one  two  three  six or twelve month interest periods for deposits of million  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of our loans 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
table of contents the interest rate we are required to pay on our borrowings  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
at december   our weighted average base rate and libor rate  plus the applicable margin  was on million  the outstanding principal amount of our revolving loan on that same date 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
if the total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility are less than the borrowing base  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee to the lenders in an amount equal to 
of the daily average of the unadvanced portion of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are also required to pay a fee of

second lien term loan facility until july   we also had a million term loan available to us under our second lien term loan agreement  or the second lien agreement 
similar to our revolving credit agreement  interest on loans made to us under this credit facility were  at our election  either an alternate base rate or a rate designated in the second lien agreement as the libo rate 
the alternate base rate was the greater of a the prime rate in effect on any day and b the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of  plus a margin of per annum 

table of contents the libo rate was generally equal to the sum of a a rate appearing in the dow jones market service for the applicable interest periods offered in one  two  three or six month periods and b an applicable margin rate per annum equal to 
our producing oil and natural gas properties were also pledged to secure payment of our indebtedness under this facility  but the liens granted to the lenders under the second lien agreement were second and junior to the rights of the lienholders under the revolving credit agreement

registration rights agreement 
on july   we also entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers relating to the senior notes 
we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and  not later than days after the date of original issue of the senior notes  file an exchange offer registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes for substantially identical notes that are registered under the securities act 
we filed an exchange offer registration statement with the sec on january  we also agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective by the sec within days after july  the registration statement became effective on january  additionally  we further agreed to promptly commence the exchange offer after such registration statement is declared effective by the sec and to keep such exchange offer open for at least business days after notice is mailed to the holders of the senior notes

commodity price risk management transactions and effects of derivative instruments the purpose of our derivative transactions is to provide a measure of stability in our cash flows 
the derivative trade arrangements we have employed include collars  costless collars  floors or purchased puts  and oil  natural gas and interest rate swaps 
in  we designated our derivative trades as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
although our purpose for entering into derivative trades has remained the same  contracts entered into after june  have not been designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had no derivatives in place that were designated as cash flow hedges 
all commodity derivative contracts at december  are accounted for by mark to market accounting whereby changes in fair value are charged to earnings 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as these changes occur in the other income expense  net 
to the extent these trades relate to production in and beyond  and oil prices increase  we will report a loss currently  but if there is no further change in prices  our revenue will be correspondingly higher than if there had been no price increase when the production is sold 
all interest rate swaps that we have entered into for and beyond are accounted for by mark to market accounting as prescribed in sfas we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative trade instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparties to mitigate this credit risk 
for additional information about our price risk management transactions  see item 
a of this annual report on form k  beginning on page future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of funding 
the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have not made any significant long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures according to market conditions 
in addition to the impact that oil and natural gas prices will have on our budget  these expenditures will also be subject to our internally generated cash flows  the availability of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from other sources  the availability of supplies and services  additional sources of funding  and our future drilling successes 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have contractual obligations and commitments that may affect our financial condition 
the following table is a summary of our significant contractual obligations obligation due in period contractual cash obligations after years total in thousands revolving credit facility secured senior notes unsecured office lease dinero plaza snyder field offices asset retirement obligations derivative obligations total the snyder office lease expires upon the cessation of production from the diamond m area wells 
the lease cost for the office facility is billed to nonaffiliated third party working interest owners under our joint operating agreements with these third parties 
asset retirement obligations of oil and natural gas assets  excluding salvage value and accretion 
deferred taxes are not included in the table above 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards combined with our plans for development and acquisitions may offset any major cash outflows 
however  the ultimate timing of the settlements cannot be precisely determined 
the amounts above include principal payment obligations under the revolving credit facility and senior notes noted in the table above  and interest payments on such indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
outlook the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the volumes of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells  the prices at which we sell oil and natural gas  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 

table of contents each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of our debt and equity securities  sales of non core properties  and other forms of financing 
except for our existing revolving credit facility  we do not have any agreements for future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
inflation our drilling costs have escalated and we would expect this trend to continue 
however  over the past several years our commodity prices have increased to offset the effects of cost inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure requirements related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements 
fas will be effective for our financial statements for the fiscal year beginning january   however  earlier application is encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption might have on our financial position or results of operations  although we do not expect any impact to be significant 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 fas which will become effective on january  fas permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of and we do not expect to elect the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments and other items 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin 
fsp fin clarifies that a reporting entity that is party to a master netting arrangement can offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under the same master netting arrangement 
fsp fin is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  adoption of fsp fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which replaces fasb statement no 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for acquisitions that occur in an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   which will be the company s fiscal year the impact  if any  will depend on the nature and size of business combinations that parallel consummates after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities 
table of contents that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after december   which will be our fiscal year based upon the december  balance sheet  the statement would have no impact 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are included and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the three years ended december  included elsewhere herein 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about market risks and our derivative instruments at december  from which we may incur future earnings  gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  our only financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates are our senior notes  bank debt and interest rate swaps 
the table below shows principal cash flows and related interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rates were determined using our interest rate at december  you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt that is sensitive to interest rates 
and after total in thousands revolving credit facility secured interest rate senior notes interest rate at december   we had outstanding bank loans in the aggregate principal amount of million at an interest rate of 
under our revolving credit facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon the agent bank s base lending rate or the libor rate  plus a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our borrowing base usage 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
as the interest rate is variable and reflects current market conditions  the carrying value of our bank debt approximates the fair value 
at december   we had outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
the carrying value of our senior notes at december  is approximately million and their estimated fair value is approximately million 
fair value is estimated based on market trades at or near december  interest on our senior notes and their carrying value are not affected by changes in interest rates 
however  the fair value of the senior notes increases as interest rates decrease and their fair value decreases as interest rates increase 
because we have no present plan or intent to redeem the senior notes  changes in their fair value are not expected to have any effect on our cash flow in the foreseeable future 
as of december   we employed fixed interest rate swap contracts with bnp paribas and citibank  na based on the day libor rates at the time of the contracts 
these contracts are accounted for by mark to market accounting as prescribed in sfas we receive interest based on a day libor rate and pay the fixed rates shown below 
we view these contracts as protection against future interest rate volatility 

table of contents below is a table describing the nature of these interest rate swaps and the fair market value of these contracts as of december  estimated notional weighted average fair market value period of time amounts fixed interest rates at december  in millions in thousands january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru october  total fair market value commodity price sensitivity as of december  our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices we received during ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we use various derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to the volatility of commodity prices 
as of december   we had employed commodity collars and swaps in order to protect against this price volatility 
although all of the contracts that we have entered into are viewed as protection against this price volatility  all contracts are accounted for by the mark to market accounting method as prescribed in sfas below is a description of our active commodity contracts as of december  collars 
collars are contracts which combine both a put option  or floor  and a call option  or ceiling 
these contracts may not involve payment or receipt of cash at inception  depending upon ceiling and floor strike prices

table of contents commodity swaps 
generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating or market price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap or fixed price for the applicable derivative contract  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap or fixed price for the applicable derivative contract 
we have entered into oil swap contracts with bnp paribas
