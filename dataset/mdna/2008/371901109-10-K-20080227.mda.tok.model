the trial in wisconsin related to this case occurred during july and the court issued its written ruling in december the court found that muth s us patent no 
 is invalid and unenforceable  and that gentex s razor turn signal mirror does not infringe that patent 
the court also denied all but one of muth s other motions with prejudice  including its motion for an injunction  and its claims for tortuous interference with its business relationships
