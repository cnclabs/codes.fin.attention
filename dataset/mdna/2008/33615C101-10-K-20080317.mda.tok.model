item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
executive summary first regional bancorp s financial results for both the year and the fourth quarter ended december  represented a continuation of the company s consistent record of profitability 
net income for the fourth quarter of totaled million  equal to cents per diluted share  compared to million  or cents per diluted shared  for the same period in for all of  net income was million  equal to per diluted share  versus net income of million  or per diluted share 
the earnings have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split effected in august at december   assets totaled billion  compared with billion a year earlier 
total deposits at year end were billion  up from billion in the prior year 
net loans advanced to a total of billion at the end of from billion at the close of the prior fiscal year 
first regional increased its capital by a net of million in  primarily through the retention of earnings  bringing total capital to million at year end  compared to million at the end of represented a year of achievement for first regional despite a challenging environment 
revenues from earning assets increased to million in from million in  but the actions of the federal reserve to reduce interest rates in the second half of put pressure on our net interest margins in that period and will continue to be a factor going forward 
nonrecurring items also had an impact on our results 
in the fourth quarter of we realized a gain of million on the redemption of restricted stock in mastercard international  but were required to create a reserve of million for our share of contingent liabilities relating to the settlement of lawsuits by visa international 
while the company expects these provisions to be recovered in  they did have an adverse effect on results 
the fourth quarter of also saw increased provisions to the loan loss reserve  both to keep pace with loan growth and to reflect the changing economic climate 
the fed s actions to reduce interest rates are in response to a slowing economy in general and a weakening real estate sector in particular 
first regional has never been involved in the riskiest segments of real estate credit  such as sub prime mortgages 
nonetheless  it appears likely that the present economic situation will impact most areas of real estate  including those in which first regional participates 
like the rest of the banking industry  first regional will continue to address significant uncertainties in the months and years ahead 
fortunately  first regional appears well positioned to deal with these challenges 
our approach has always been to maintain a conservative posture  with an emphasis on managing risk and maintaining operating efficiency 
our focus on asset quality gives us the flexibility to deal effectively with problems as they arise  and we have the years of experience and expertise needed to manage our operations effectively with difficult times 
moreover  our prudent reserves and strong capital base give us the financial strength to weather adverse conditions and respond to opportunities that emerge

tony gartshore has been a key member of that team for over a decade  and over the years has worked to build first regional into the institution that it is today 
with extensive experience gathered in good times and bad  first regional is well prepared to address the challenges and opportunities ahead as the company pursues the primary goal of protecting and enhancing the company s financial strength and shareholder value over the long term 
summary first regional bancorp  a bank holding company the company  and one of its subsidiaries  first regional bank  primarily serve southern california through their branches 
first regional bancorp has six other subsidiaries  first regional statutory trust iii  first regional statutory trust iv  first regional statutory trust v  first regional statutory trust vi  first regional statutory trust vii and first regional statutory trust viii  that exist for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated deferrable debentures issued by the company and engaging in certain other limited activities  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion and analysis relates primarily to the bank and its three reportable business segments consisting of core bank operations  the administrative services provided by the bank s division  trust administration services tas  and the bank s trust services division 
for segment reporting financial information see note of the consolidated financial statements 
core bank operations the principal business activities of this segment are attracting funds from the general public and originating real estate and commercial loans for small and midsize businesses in southern california 
this segment s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities  and fees earned in connection with loans and deposits 
this segment s principal expenses consist of interest paid on deposits  personnel  and other general and administrative expenses 
the bank s core bank operations also include the bank s merchant services division  which provides credit card and ach processing for merchants 
administrative services the principal business activity of this segment is providing administrative services for self directed retirement plans 
the primary source of revenue for this segment is fee income from self directed accounts 
the segment s principal expenses consist of personnel  rent  data processing  and other general and administrative expenses 
trust services the principal business activity of this segment is providing trust services for living trusts  investment agency accounts  ira rollovers  and all forms of court related matters 
the primary source of revenue for this segment is fee income 
the segment s principal expenses consist of personnel  data processing  professional fees  and other general and administrative expenses 
the company achieved continued profitability in  with increases in assets  deposits and loans 
the company continues to benefit from strategic decisions made previously  when the company initiated a program of prudent  managed growth  this program resulted in higher levels of earning assets and interest revenue in  and the company s profitability was also in part a reflection of the continued low levels of nonperforming loans  other real estate owned  and other nonearning assets 
average assets in were  compared to  in and  in as was the case in and  the company s asset growth in was funded by an increase in deposits  as well as by the retention of earnings for the year 
the company generated net income of  in compared to  in and  in critical accounting policies accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment as described in loan portfolio and provision for loan losses 
we generally cease to accrue interest on any loan with respect to which the loan s contractual payments are more than days delinquent  as well as loans classified substandard for which interest payment reserves were established from loan funds rather than borrower funds 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan for which management has determined that collection of our investment in the loan is not reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure  are transferred to the other real estate owned portfolio and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less costs to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value includes revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property less construction and renovation costs 
there was no other real estate owned as of december  or net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest income earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest income or expense are determined by the average volume of interest bearing assets or liabilities  and the average rate of interest earned or paid on those assets or liabilities 
as was the case during  in the company s continued growth efforts resulted in an increase in interest earning assets  including loans 
the bank s core loan portfolio increased by during the asset growth reflects a corresponding increase in total deposits resulting from an increase in full service bank branches during and an increase in personnel in and the deposit growth was centered in time deposits and money market deposits  while there was a decline in noninterest bearing deposits and a slight decline in savings deposits 
average money market and time deposits increased in as compared to the prior year 
deposit levels increased and interest rates increased in from  and the combination led to an increase in interest expense in interest rates and interest differential the following table sets forth the average balances outstanding for major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the average interest rates earned and paid thereon for year ended december  average balance interest income expense average yield rate average balance interest income expense average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans     investment securities    federal funds sold   time deposits with other financial institutions  total interest earning assets   for year ended december  average balance income expense yield rate average balance income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities savings deposits    money market accounts    time deposits     fhlb advances     other borrowings subordinated debentures     total interest bearing liabilities   this figure reflects total loans  including non accrual loans  and is not net of the allowance for losses  which had an average balance of  and  in and  respectively and is not net of deferred loan fees  which had an average balance of  and  in and  respectively

includes loan fees of  and  in and  respectively 
because customer deposits are the company s principal funding source outside of its capital  management has attempted to match repricing characteristics of its deposits with its investment and loan portfolios as part of its liquidity and asset and liability management policies 
the objective of these policies is to manage the company s interest rate sensitivity and limit the fluctuations of net interest income resulting from interest rate changes 
the table which follows in section a indicates the repricing or maturity characteristics of the major categories of the bank s assets and liabilities as of december   and thus the relative sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
other operating income other operating income increased for to  versus  in and  for the year trust administration services tas  the bank s division that provides administrative services to self directed retirement plans  had revenue that totaled  during and  during and  during the bank s merchant services operation  which provides credit card deposit and clearing services to retailers and other credit card accepting businesses  had revenue that totaled  in   in and  in the bank s trust services department  which provides trust services for living trusts  investment agency accounts  ira rollovers  and all forms of court related matters commenced operations in and had revenue that totaled  in   in and  in during the fourth quarter of  the company realized a gain of  on the redemption of restricted stock in mastercard international 
loan portfolio and provision for loan losses the loan portfolio consisted of the following at december  and dollars in thousands commercial loans   real estate construction loans   real estate loans   government guaranteed loans   other loans   total loans   less allowances for loan losses deferred loan fees   net loans   the bank offers a full range of lending services including commercial  real estate  and real estate construction loans 
the bank has developed a substantial portfolio of short and medium term mini perm first trust deed loans for income properties as well as specializing in construction lending for moderate size commercial and residential projects 
the bank also offers commercial loans for commercial and industrial borrowers  which includes equipment financing as well as short term loans 
typically the bank s loans are floating rate and have no prepayment penalties 
interest only loans allow interest only payments for a fixed period of time 
the loans generally mature at the end of the interest only period and require a balloon payment 
at december  and we had  and  of short and medium term mini perm first trust deed loans for income properties with interest only payments that have a balloon payment at loan maturity 
the bank does not offer residential mortgage products  negative amortization loans  option arms  or sub prime loan products 
the allowance for loan losses is intended to reflect the known and unknown risks which are inherent in a loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is continually evaluated in light of many factors  including loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the company s emphasis on maintaining high asset quality continued in  and as a result  non performing assets loans past due ninety days or more excluding government guaranteed loans  loans on nonaccrual status  and other real estate owned totaled  at the end of   on december  and  on december  management believes the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate in relation to both existing and potential risks in the loan portfolio 
the bank has historically evaluated the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses on an overall basis rather than by specific categories of loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  known problem loans  evaluations made by bank regulatory authorities  assessment of economic conditions and other appropriate data to identify the risks in the loan portfolio 
the first major element includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio in two phases 
the first phase is conducted in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
individual loans are reviewed to identify loans for impairment 
a loan is impaired when principal and interest are deemed uncollectable in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is measured as either the expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the loan s collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or an observable market price of the loan if one exists 
upon measuring the impairment  the bank will insure an appropriate level of allowance is present or established 
central to the first phase and the bank s credit risk management is its loan risk rating system 
the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating  which is based primarily on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition  which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
credits undergo a quarterly loan review and a periodic review by the regulators 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
based on the risk rating system specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicates the probability that a loss has been incurred 
management performs a detailed analysis of these loans  including  but not limited to  cash flows  appraisals of the collateral  conditions of the marketplace for liquidating the collateral and assessment of the guarantors 
management then determines the inherent loss potential and allocates a portion of the allowance for losses as a specific allowance for each of these credits 
the second phase is conducted by evaluating or segmenting the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in this second phase  groups or pools of homogeneous loans are reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
additionally groups of non homogeneous loans  such as construction loans  are also reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
the risk assessment process in this case emphasizes trends in the different portfolios for delinquency  loss  and other behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios 
the second major element in the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of management s considerations of all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect a loan s collectibility 
this includes management s estimates of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties  the volatility of the market value of collateral  and other relevant factors 
the relationship of the two major elements of the allowance to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions which are charged to operating expense and is reduced by loan chargeoffs 
any subsequent recoveries of charged off loans are added back into the allowance 
based on ongoing analysis of the risks presented by the loan portfolio  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
by way of comparison  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
these transactions brought the balance of the allowance for loan losses at the end of to  or of total loans  compared to the balance of  or of total loans  and compared to  or of total loans at december  in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in contrast  during  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
the company s policy is generally to discontinue the accrual of interest income on impaired loans  and to recognize income on such loans only after the loan principal has been repaid in full  and to establish a specific loss reserve for each of the loans which at december  and totaled  and  respectively  for the loans as a group 
operating expenses total operating expenses rose in to  from  in and  in while the total expense figures increased primarily due to increases in overall bank growth  most components continue to be moderated by the effects of an ongoing program of expense control 
salaries and related benefits expense increased again in  rising to  from a total of  and from  in the increase in this expense category principally reflects the increases in staffing in the main office and the new regional offices as part of the company s growth initiative 
occupancy expense rose in  to  from  in and a total of  the increases reflect the rent paid on the various facilities which house the bank s expansion of the main office and the regional offices 
other expenses rose again in as they did in and other expenses totaled  in compared to  in  which was increased from  in other expenses in include professional services of  an increase from the prior years when professional services were  for and  in  the increases primarily relate to increased audit  and accounting fees due to the more extensive regulatory requirements applicable to larger companies 
data processing fees increased in to  compared to  in and  in equipment expense increased to  during from  during and  for telephone and postage expense increased to  during from  during and  for customer courier service increased during to  compared to  during and  for the increases in data processing fees  equipment expense  telephone and postage  and customer courier service expense relate primarily to the growth of the bank 
directors fees increased due to increased corporate regulations and were  in   in  and  in most of the remaining categories of other expense  generally remained stable with the exception of the special reserves in noted below  which rose to  in from  in and  in principally due to higher costs of services provided to customers 
during the year ended december   the issuer s subsidiary  first regional bank  recorded a charge of  for its share of contingent liabilities relating to settlement of lawsuits by visa international 
during the year ended december   the issuer s subsidiary  first regional bank  recorded a charge of  reflected in other expense to add to a special reserve in connection with the termination of certain business operations of the bank s merchant services division 
the  reserve represents approximately of an amount  approximately million  that the bank had been carrying as a receivable due from an outside service provider which arose in connection with the bank s former engagement in the business of supplying cash to atm machines  which activity was terminated in while the bank believed that it was entitled to the entire amount due of approximately million  the bank established the reserve due to the uncertain and protracted timing of collection 
as of december   all but  of this receivable had previously been reserved against 
during  the bank entered into a full and final settlement of litigation related to an account receivable arising out of the bank s merchant services division 
the bank recovered  from the defendant in full settlement of the matter  which resulted in a charge of approximately  or  after tax during taxes the combined effects of the activity described above resulted in income before taxes of  in  a decrease from  in  and an increase form  in in  the company recorded tax provisions of  the company recorded tax provisions of  and  during and  respectively 
as a result  the company generated net income of  in  compared to  in  and versus net income of  in contractual obligations the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in notes    and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits without a stated maturity  time deposits    federal home loan bank advances  federal funds purchases   subordinated debentures     note payable operating leases     excludes interest

one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands commitments to extend credit undisbursed loans   standby letters of credit   commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  as these commitments may expire without being drawn on based upon the company s historical experience 
the bank is a member of the visa usa network 
on october   the visa organization of affiliated entities completed a series of global restructuring transactions to combine its affiliated operating companies  including visa usa  under a single holding company  visa inc visa inc 
intends to issue and sell a majority of its shares to the public in an initial public offering 
based upon the bank s membership share of visa usa and the accounting guidance that the company has received  the company recorded a litigation liability and corresponding expense of  relating to pending litigation in antitrust lawsuits 
although visa by laws could require the company to fund its proportionate share of this amount to visa  it is anticipated that an escrow account established and funded through a multi step funding mechanism during the planned initial public offering will be used to pay substantially all of the settlement 
in the event this public offering occurs  the company expects that the proceeds of the anticipated share redemption as a result of the planned initial public offering would more than offset this amount as well as other losses arising out of the litigation 
the bank has previously announced its intention to discontinue its program of providing custodial services to the third party administrators of self directed individual retirement accounts 
the plan assets for which the bank serves as custodian are expected to be transferred to the successor custodians in while no such occurrences are anticipated  a contingent liability exists for any plan assets held by the bank which are missing  unlocatable  or otherwise unable to be transferred to the successor custodians 
since no such occurrences are anticipated  it is impossible to determine what  if any  contingent liability exists 
as previously noted  the third party administered ira account program being terminated is separate and apart from the bank s trust administration services division whereby the bank rather than non bank third parties provides administrative services on behalf of self directed individual retirement accounts

 fair value measurements sfas  which provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies when gaap requires or allows assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and therefore  does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstance 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm s length transaction between market participants in the markets where we conduct business 
sfas clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices available in active markets and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency 
the level of the reliability of inputs utilized for fair value calculations drives the extent of disclosure requirements of the valuation methodologies used under the standard
