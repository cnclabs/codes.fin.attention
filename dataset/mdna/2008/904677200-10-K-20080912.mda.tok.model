item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations review of fiscal year results of operations weeks compared to fiscal year weeks for fiscal year losses directly related to customer bankruptcies 
as one of the many participants in the us and regional textile and apparel supply chain  the company s business and competitive position are directly impacted by the business and financial condition of the other participants across the supply chain in which it operates  including other regional yarn manufacturers  knitters and weavers 
if other supply chain participants are unable to access capital  fund their operations and make required technological and other investments in their businesses or experience diminished demand for their products  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents failure to implement future technological advances in the textile industry or fund capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and net sales 
the company s operating results depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce innovative products and applications and to continue to develop its production processes to be a competitive producer 
accordingly  to maintain its competitive position and its revenue base  the company must continually modernize its manufacturing processes  plants and equipment 
to this end  the company has made significant investments in its manufacturing infrastructure over the past fifteen years and does not currently anticipate any significant additional capital expenditures to replace or expand its production facilities over the next five years 
accordingly  the company expects its capital requirements in the near term will be used primarily to maintain its manufacturing operations  but future technological advances in the textile industry may result in the availability of new products or increase the efficiency of existing manufacturing and distribution systems  and the company may not be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer such products on a timely basis or establish or maintain competitive positions if it does not incur significant capital expenditures for expansion purposes 
existing  proposed or yet undeveloped technologies may render its technology less profitable or less viable  and the company may not have available the financial and other resources to compete effectively against companies possessing such technologies 
to the extent sources of funds are insufficient to meet its ongoing capital improvement requirements  the company would need to seek alternative sources of financing or curtail or delay capital spending plans 
the company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the company is unable to predict which of the many possible future products and services will meet the evolving industry standards and consumer demands 
if the company fails to make the capital improvements necessary to continue the modernization of its manufacturing operations and reduction of its costs  its competitive position may suffer  and its net sales may decline 
unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of the company s facilities may cause significant lost production  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s manufacturing process could be affected by operational problems that could impair its production capability 
each of its facilities contains complex and sophisticated machines that are used in its manufacturing process 
disruptions at any of its facilities could be caused by maintenance outages  prolonged power failures or reductions  a breakdown  failure or substandard performance of any of its machines  the effect of noncompliance with material environmental requirements or permits  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels or roads  fires  floods  earthquakes or other catastrophic disasters  labor difficulties  or other operational problems 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of its facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company has made and may continue to make investments in entities that it does not control 
the company has established joint ventures and made minority interest investments designed to increase its vertical integration  increase efficiencies in its procurement  manufacturing processes  marketing and distribution in the us and other markets 
the company s principal joint ventures and minority investments include unf  pal  and yufi 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for a further discussion 
the company s inability to control entities in which it invests may affect its ability to receive distributions from those entities or to fully implement its business plan 
the incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by an entity not under its control may result in restrictions or prohibitions on that entity s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
even where these entities are not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions  the company may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of such distributions 
in addition  if any of the other investors in these entities fails to observe its commitments  that entity may not be able to operate according to its business plan or the company may be required to increase its level of commitment 
if any of these events were to occur  its business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
because the company does not own a majority or maintain voting control of these entities  the company does not have the ability to control their policies  
table of contents management or affairs 
the interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from the company s  and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in its best interest 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its partners in these entities  the company could lose its ability to operate in these areas which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could adversely affect its business 
the company has expanded its business partly through acquisitions and may continue to make selective acquisitions 
the company s acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  obtaining financing on acceptable terms  and its ability to comply with the restrictions contained in its debt agreements 
acquisitions may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of its business 
future acquisitions may also have an adverse effect on its operating results  particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following their completion while the company integrates the operations of the acquired business 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could have a material adverse effect on business and financial results  including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies 
once integrated  acquired operations may not achieve the levels of revenues  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by its existing operations  or otherwise performs as expected 
while the company has experience in identifying and integrating acquisitions  the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain the capital necessary to pursue its acquisition strategy or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all 
even if the company successfully completes an acquisition  it may not be able to integrate it into its business satisfactorily or at all 
increases of illegal transshipment of textile and apparel goods into the us could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry experts and trade associations illegal transshipments of apparel products into the us continues to negatively impact the textile market 
illegal transshipment involves circumventing quotas by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are a product of a particular country of origin or include yarn of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements  such as nafta and cafta 
if illegal transshipment is not monitored and enforcement is not effective  these shipments could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company is subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  the protection of the environment and the use or cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes 
the company may incur substantial costs  including fines  damages and criminal or civil sanctions  or experience interruptions in its operations for actual or alleged violations of or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s operations could result in violations of environmental laws  including spills or other releases of hazardous substances to the environment 
in the event of a catastrophic incident  the company could incur material costs 
in addition  the company could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
for example  on september   the company completed its acquisition of the polyester filament manufacturing assets located at kinston from invista 
the land for the kinston site was leased pursuant to a year ground lease with dupont 
since  dupont has been investigating and cleaning up the kinston site under the supervision of the epa and denr pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act corrective action program 
the corrective action program requires dupont to identify all potential aocs  assess the extent of contamination at the identified aocs and clean them up to comply with applicable regulatory standards 
under the terms of the ground lease  upon completion by dupont of required remedial action  ownership of the kinston site was to pass to the company and after seven years of sliding scale shared responsibility with dupont  the company would have had sole responsibility for future remediation requirements  if any 
effective 
table of contents march   the company entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain of the assets at kinston to dupont 
this agreement terminated the ground lease and relieved the company of any future responsibility for environmental remediation  other than participation with dupont  if so called upon  with regard to the company s period of operation of the kinston site 
however  the company continues to own a satellite service facility acquired in the invista transaction that has contamination from dupont s operations and is monitored by denr 
this site has been remediated by dupont and dupont has received authority from denr to discontinue remediation  other than natural attenuation 
dupont s duty to monitor and report to denr will be transferred to the company in the future  at which time dupont must pay the company seven years of monitoring and reporting costs and the company will assume responsibility for any future remediation and monitoring of this site 
at this time  the company has no basis to determine if and when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the aocs or the extent of any potential liability for the same 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources environmental liabilities 
furthermore  the company may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from its properties or at off site locations where the company disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated the purchase of its businesses 
if significant previously unknown contamination is discovered  existing laws or their enforcement change or its indemnities do not cover the costs of investigation and remediation  then such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
health and safety regulation costs could increase 
the company s operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the us occupational safety and health administration and comparable statutes in foreign jurisdictions where the company operates 
the company believes that it employs appropriate precautions to protect its employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at its facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against the company for work related illnesses or injury  and changes in occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the us or in foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates could increase its operating costs 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  the company may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or be found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceedings  and such costs may be material to the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by adverse employee relations 
the company employs approximately  employees  approximately  of which are domestic employees and approximately of which are foreign employees 
while employees of its foreign operations are generally unionized  none of its domestic employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements with employees of the company s foreign operations and other labor relations issues  including union organizing activities  could result in an increase in costs or lead to a strike  work stoppage or slow down 
such labor issues and unrest by its employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company is required to assess the impairment of the company s long lived assets  such as plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
when the company determines that the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more impairment indicators  the company then measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 any such impairment charges will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations review of fiscal year results of operations weeks compared to fiscal year weeks for fiscal year impairment charges relating to long lived assets 
in addition  the company evaluates the net values assigned to various equity investments it holds  such as its investment in yufi  pal  and unf  in accordance with the provisions of apb apb requires that a loss in value of an investment  which is other than a temporary decline  should be recognized as an impairment loss 
any such impairment losses will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for more information regarding the company s equity investments 
any operating losses resulting from impairment charges under sfas no 
or apb could have an adverse effect on its operating results and therefore the market price of its securities  including its common stock 
the company s business could be adversely affected if the company fails to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  licenses  confidentiality and other agreements to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  this protection may not be fully adequate its intellectual property rights may be challenged or invalidated  an infringement suit by the company against a third party may not be successful and or third parties could design around its technology or adopt trademarks similar to its own 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which its products are manufactured and sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although the company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  independent contractors and current and potential strategic and joint venture partners  among others  such agreements may be breached  and the company could be harmed by unauthorized use or disclosure of its confidential information 
further  the company licenses trademarks from third parties  and these agreements may terminate or become subject to litigation 
its failure to protect its intellectual property could materially and adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business 
the company may also be accused of infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of its personnel 
should the company be found liable for infringement  the company may be required to enter into licensing arrangements if available on acceptable terms or at all or pay damages and cease selling certain products or using certain product names or technology 
the company s failure to prevail in any intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business

accordingly  the company plans to form utsc 
this will benefit the company by removing the challenges facing the joint venture and its commodity production  while providing greater flexibility  faster product innovation  and enhanced service to customers in the growing high value segments 
under the new business model in china  the company will continue to market innovative high value and pva products as well as work with customers to grow in applications designed to meet ever changing consumer demands  while ensuring high quality production of these products 
initially  the company s partner  ycfc  will likely serve as the primary toll manufacturer for its pva yarns  and the company expects a seamless transition for its customers in the region 
utsc may add other toll manufacturers as appropriate  and may expect to quickly grow the portfolio of pva yarns available in the region 
the company expects utsc to be operational during the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  the company expects to invest between approximately million to million for initial startup costs and working capital requirements for utsc
