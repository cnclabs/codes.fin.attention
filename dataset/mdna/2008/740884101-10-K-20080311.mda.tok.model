item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  interest rate risk annuity considerations the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the insurance company s annuity considerations for each of the five fiscal years ended december   as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles  which include as revenue the consideration from policyholders in such years other than consideration from immediate annuities without life contingencies 
the information below differs from the premiums shown on the corporation s consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in that  under gaap  consideration from single premium annuity contracts without life contingencies  universal life insurance products and deferred annuities are not reported as premium revenues  but are reported as additions to policyholder account balances  which are liabilities on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
distribution of products by gross annuity considerations for the fiscal years ended december  single premium dollars in thousands deferred immediate other annuities total annuities life insurance business graded benefit life policies the only life product currently issued are products designed for the upper age ie ages in most states  substandard applicant 
depending upon age  these products provide for a limited death benefit of either the return of premium plus interest for three years  or the return of premium plus interest for two years 
thereafter  the death benefit is limited to the face amount of the policy 
this product typically is offered with a maximum face value of  other life products inforce  but no longer being issued  include universal life  whole life  and term life 
universal life policies  flexible premium and single premium  are interest sensitive products  which typically provide the insured with non participating ie non dividend paying life insurance with a cash value 
current interest is credited to the policy s cash value based primarily upon prevailing interest rates 
in no event  however  will the interest rate credited on the policy s cash value be less then the guaranteed rate specified in the policy 
whole life policies are products that provide the insured with life insurance with a guaranteed cash value 
typically  a fixed premium  which costs more than comparable term coverage when the policyholder is younger  but less than comparable term coverage as the policyholder grows older  is paid over a period of years 
whole life insurance products combine insurance protection with a savings plan that gradually increases over a period of time  which the policyholder may borrow against 
term life policies are products that provide insurance protection if the insured dies during the time period specified in the policy 
no cash value is built up 
term life products provide the maximum benefit for the lowest initial premium outlay 
insurance policies inforce the following table sets forth universal  whole and term life insurance policies inforce  as well as certain statistical data for each of the five years ended december  life insurance inforce dollars in thousands beginning of year universal whole term total sales and additions universal whole term total terminations death surrenders and conversions lapses other total end of year universal whole term total total reinsurance ceded total insurance inforce at end of year net of reinsurance includes graded benefit life insurance products accident and health new york statutory disability benefits  dbl are short term disability contracts issued to employers of one or more employees in new york state 
the benefit must be equal or better  in every respect  to the minimum benefits defined in the new york disability benefits law 
the minimum benefit allowed is of the weekly earnings to a maximum of commencing on the th day of non occupation disabilities for a maximum of weeks in any week period for any one disability 
with few exceptions  employers are required to provide this coverage to their new york employees 
medical stop loss coverage is sold to employers not individual employees to cover their liabilities as incurred in the administration of self funded medical plans 
these are plans that are governed by erisa 
the employer does not buy a full insured plan from a carrier  but instead opts to pay the benefits for its medical plan itself 
the parameters of these benefits are spelled out in a plan document that is disseminated to employees 
the employer then purchases stop loss coverage to insure it against claims in excess of contractually designated amounts 
the coverage purchased by the employer will typically cover two types of risks to the self funded plan the risk that a claim on an individual employee exceeds a certain level  usually called the specific deductible or self insured retention 
this is known as specific stop loss coverage 
this level is usually defined in terms of dollars on a particular life 
for example  the specific deductible may be  of claims paid by the plan on any one life 
the risk that the overall claims for the plan less whatever amount is covered under the specific deductible exceeds a given level 
this is called aggregate stop loss 
the given level is usually called the aggregate attachment point 
it is typically defined by first computing the level of claims the insurer expects to occur in the given period 
to this amount is added a corridor or margin amount  which is typically 
the aggregate cover would then reimburse all claims that exceed of expected claims  exclusive of those claims reimbursed under the specific cover 
both types of plans generally have a maximum reimbursement level 
for specific claims  this generally ranges from million to million 
for aggregate claims  the coverage is generally million 
sometimes  the specific coverage is sold without the aggregate coverage 
the reverse is almost never sold 
one key aspect of stop loss coverage is that reimbursement is made to the plan  not to the individual participants 
the participants medical expenses are paid by the plan 
as such  only expenses covered under the plan and that are spelled out in the plan document  are covered 
marketing and distribution the insurance company is licensed to market insurance products in states and the district of columbia 
the insurance company distributes its annuity contracts and life insurance policies products through independent general agents of which are located in new york state 
these general agents  in turn  distribute the insurance company s products through their  licensed insurance agents or brokers most of whom also distribute similar products marketed by other insurance companies 
management believes the insurance company offers innovative products and quality service and that its product commission rates are competitive 
the new york state department of insurance nysid regulates general agent commission rates 
the independent general agent system is the insurance company s primary product distribution system 
management believes the insurance company s focus on the general agent distribution system provides cost advantages since the insurance company incurs minimal fixed costs associated with recruiting  training and maintaining agents via their general agents 
therefore  a substantial portion of the costs normally associated with product distribution is variable 
distribution costs rise and fall with the level of business 
the insurance company utilizes many general agents to distribute its products and  therefore  is not dependent on any one general agent or agent for a substantial amount of its business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
generally  the insurance company issues annuity contracts along with the general agent s commission within two business days after application receipt 
the insurance company also provides general agent support by providing direct access to the insurance company s senior executives 
annuity contract and life insurance policyholders may access information regarding their individual holdings via the company s website or toll free telephone number 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of the insurance company s sales in no single general agent accounted for more than and no single agent accounted for more than of total sales 
management believes no single distribution source loss will have a material adverse impact on the insurance company 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales unless these sources are timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  the insurance company continuously recruits new independent general agents 
underwriting procedures since march  the only life policy the insurance company has issued has been graded benefit life  a guaranteed issue product that requires no underwriting 
the maximum face amount for this product is  the insurance company continues to maintain its life inforce business and this may require additional underwriting ie reinstatements  re entries  and conversions 
in that regard  the insurance company has adopted and follows detailed  uniform underwriting procedures designed to assess and quantify insurance risks 
to the extent that a policyholder eligible for reinstatement  reentry or conversion does not meet the insurance company s underwriting standards at the standard risk classifications  the insurance company may offer to issue a classified  sub standard or impaired risk policy for a risk adjusted premium amount rather than declining the application 
the amount of the insurance company s impai red risk insurance in force in proportion to the total amount of the insurance company s individual life insurance in force was approximately at december  policy claims individual life claims are received and reviewed by claims examiners at the insurance company s home office 
the initial review of claims includes verification that coverage is in force and that the claim is not subject to exclusion under the policy 
birth and death certificates are basic requirements 
medical records and investigative reports are ordered for contestable claims 
reinsurance the insurance company follows the usual industry practice of reinsuring ceding portions of its life insurance and medical stop loss risks with other companies  a practice that permits the insurance company to write policies in amounts larger than the risk it is willing to retain and to obtain commissions on the insurance ceded and thereby reduce its net commission expense 
the maximum amount of individual life insurance normally retained by the insurance company on any one life is  per policy and  per life 
the insurance company cedes primarily on an automatic basis  under which risks are ceded to a reinsurer on specific blocks of business where the underlying risks meet certain predetermined criteria  and on a facultative basis  under which the reinsurer s prior approval is required on each risk reinsured 
the maximum retention of the group medical stop loss business varies  but typically the insurance company cedes on a quota share basis 
use of reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from liability on the insurance ceded 
an insurer is required to pay the full amount of its insurance obligations regardless of whether it is entitled or able to receive payments from the reinsurer 
at december   of the approximately  million of the company s individual life insurance in force  the insurance company had ceded to reinsurer s approximately million 
the principal reinsurance companies of individual life policies with whom the insurance company did business at december  were transamerica occidental life insurance company and swiss re life and health america  inc am best rating of a superior 
competition the insurance company operates in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms  and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with the insurance company  many of which are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than the insurance company 
the insurance company believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in the insurance company s target markets 
management believes that the insurance company s ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market its products and to successfully develop competitive  profitable products 
management believes that the insurance company has good relationships with its agents  has an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and generally is competitive within the industry in all applicable areas 
investments and investment policy at december   the corporation had an aggregate of investment assets and cash of billion 
of that amount  approximately  or billion  were invested in fixed maturity bonds and notes  consisting primarily of corporate bonds billion  us government  government agencies and authorities bonds million  public utility bonds million  commercial mortgage backed securities million  and preferred stocks million 
approximately million or of invested assets were invested in limited partnerships  million or was invested in cash and short term investments and the remainder was held as common stock  swaptions  policy loans and real estate 
investment grade securities as of december   approximately or billion of the corporation s investment portfolio consisted of investment grade securities according to naic designations and investment grade short term commercial paper 
of that amount  approximately billion consisted of investment grade corporate bonds and preferred stock and million consisted of short term securities and commercial paper rated predominantly a p or higher but in no event lower than a p with terms of days or less 
the remaining billion  consisting of us government bonds and government agency securities  public utility bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities  are discussed below 
approximately million were privately placed securities that management believes are marketable to other institutional investors 
below investment grade securities as of december   the corporation held approximately million in below investment grade securities  according to naic designations  representing approximately of the corporation s investment portfolio 
this compares to million  or of the corporation s investment portfolio at december  of the amount  million consisted of corporate bonds and preferred stock  million of public utility bonds and million of local governmental authority bonds 
of these  approximately million were rated at the highest below grade investment level 
approximately  ninety one percent of the corporation s holdings of below grade bonds were originally purchased at investment grade levels 
included in the below grade bond portfolios are non performing assets totaling million  or of total invested assets 
government bonds and agency securities as of december   the corporation held approximately million in us treasury or other government agency bonds consisting primarily of us treasury and gnma  fnma  fhlmc and fhlb obligations 
public utility bonds as of december   the corporation held million in public utility bonds  representing of the investment portfolio 
of that amount  or million consisted of investment grade securities 
approximately of the holdings represented bonds issued by the operating companies of electric and gas utilities  with the balance consisting of an assortment of electric utility holding company bonds  capital trust securities and us dollar holdings in foreign electric and water utilities 
the portfolio is diversified  with individual holdings of primarily investment grade companies 
given their large and continuing need for additional capital  public utilities are sensitive to a general rise in overall interest rates 
however  these risks are mitigated by overall economic growth  as utilities benefit by increased usage of electricity and gas and by an overall growth in their customer rate base 
callable agency securities the company from time to time purchases callable bonds and notes issued by one of the us government sponsored entities fnma  fhlmc  fhlb and the ffcb 
as of december   the company had a market value total of approximately million in positions as shown below 
book value market value federal farm credit bank ffcb federal home loan bank fhlb freddie mac fhlmc fannie mae fnma total callable agencies frequently issue callable paper with spreads that compensate the buyer for the agencies call options and make their paper more competitive with fixed rate corporate bonds 
the company typically purchases the callable agency issues at par  or discounts to par  to insure that the yield to call is at least equal to the yield to maturity and to avoid principal loss in the event the issuer exercises its par call option 
in the event that interest rates fall and a call option is exercised  the company may be forced to reinvest at lower yields 
mortgage backed securities as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio was invested in commercial mortgage backed obligations cmbs  purchased between and this compares to million  or of the company s portfolio at december  the company s cmbs portfolio has not been materially impacted by prepayment risk because it purchases such securities at prices no greater than par and the insurance company has invested primarily in mezzanine level cmbs that generally have limited prepayment risk 
these securities are collateralized by commercial mortgages  which have provisions that limit loan prepayments and a security structure that directs principal payments to the senior most outstanding securities before they make such distributions to the mezzanine debt owned by the insurance company 
the company has not made any direct investments in residential mortgage backed securities rmbs since the company s total rmbs exposure is less than million or of invested assets 
these securities are all investment grade rated 
collateralized debt obligations the company has a small portfolio approximately million or of invested assets at december  of collateralized debt obligations cdo that were purchased between and these securities are collateralized with high yield bank loans and high yield bonds 
these positions have substantial unrealized gains 
the cdo portfolio was responsible for generating approximately million of income in the market value and level of distributed income of the cdo portfolio is expected to fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the changes in credit spreads associated with below investment grade debt 
limited partnerships the insurance company has been investing in limited partnerships for over nineteen years 
during this time  the insurance company has had an opportunity to consider and evaluate a substantial number of limited partnerships and their managers 
the insurance company makes limited partnership investments based on a number of considerations  including the reputation  investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk  performance history and investment strategy of the manager of the limited partnership 
managers of the limited partnerships in which the insurance company is invested include  among others  blackstone investment management  starwood capital  goldman sachs capital partners  apollo real estate and fortress investment group 
the book value of the corporation s investments in limited partnerships as of december   and was approximately million  million and million respectively 
net investment income derived from the insurance company s interests in limited partnership investments aggregated approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
these amounts represented  and of the company s total net investment income in such years pursuant to the terms of certain limited partnership agreements to which the insurance company is a party  the insurance company is committed to contribute  if called upon  an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to such limited partnerships 
commitments of million will expire in  million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over seventy limited partnerships  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including debt restructurings  real estate  international opportunities and merchant banking 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings  with the exception of hedge fund limited partnerships 
approximately of the company s investment portfolio in limited partnerships is involved in distressed asset investments 
these limited partnerships take positions in debt and equity securities  loans originated by banks and other liabilities of financially troubled companies 
investments in companies undergoing debt restructurings  which by their nature have a high degree of financial uncertainty  may be senior  unsecured or subordinated indebtedness and carry a high characteristic of merchant banking and debt restructuring transactions 
this makes such underlying investments particularly sensitive to interest rate increases  which could affect the ability of the borrower to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its fixed charges 
the limited partnerships that are involved in real estate activities  representing approximately of the company s limited partnership portfolio  generally invest in real estate assets  real estate joint ventures and real estate operating companies 
these partnerships seek to achieve significant rates of return by targeting investments that provide a strategic or competitive advantage and are priced at levels that the general partner believes to be attractive 
the limited partnerships that are involved in international investments generally purchase sovereign debt  corporate debt  and or equity in foreign companies that are developing a greater worldwide presence 
general partners who had demonstrated expertise in this area and in the particular country involved operate such limited partnerships 
such investments involve risks related to the particular country including political instability  currency fluctuations  and repatriation restrictions 
the limited partnerships that are involved in merchant banking activities generally seek to achieve significant rates of return including capital gains through a wide variety of investment strategies  including leveraged acquisitions  bridge financing  and other private equity investments in existing businesses 
limited partnership investments are selected through a careful  two stage review process 
the investment analyst staff conducts a due diligence review which includes the offering documents  performance history of each investment manager as well as interviews with existing investors and or market participants 
separately  the investment committee interviews the manager to determine whether the investment philosophy particularly with respect to risk and strategies of the limited partnership are in the best interests of the insurance company 
only after both the investment analyst staff and the investment committee make a positive recommendation does the insurance company invest in a limited partnership 
in addition  the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the corporation or the insurance company  as the case may be 
to evaluate both the carrying value and the con tinuing appropriateness of the company s investment in any limited partnership  management maintains ongoing discussions with the investment manager and considers the limited partnership s operations  current and near term projected financial condition  earnings capacity and distributions received by the insurance company during the year 
despite the company s ongoing successful returns on its limited partnership investments and their substantial contributions to the company s profits in recent years  the ratings agencies which evaluate the company have an unfavorable view of such investments 
the company believes that this has had a negative effect on the company s ratings see item management s discussion and analysis ratings agencies 
as such  although the limited partnership investments have contributed substantially to the company s profits  they have not enabled the company to achieve the ratings upgrades that might be expected to accompany such profitable performance 
this factor is continually monitored by company s management in determining whether and to what extent the company will continue to invest in limited partnerships at current  reduced or increased levels 
such decisions will be subject to the approval of the chief investment officer and the investment committee and the review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company  as the case may be 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships that it has received during the foregoing periods or that it will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance company s financial condition and results of operations 
other as of december   the company s investment portfolio included approximately million invested in preferred stock  and approximately million invested in common stock 
the company s only direct real estate investments are two buildings in nyack  new york  which are used as the current home office of the insurance company  and two acres of undeveloped land in nyack  new york

consist principally of investments in limited partnerships  which are accounted for under the equity method 
the equity method is an accounting method used to determine income derived from a company s investment in another company over which it exerts significant influence 
under the equity method  investment income equals a share of net income proportional to the size of the equity investment 
insurance regulation general regulation as an insurance holding company  the corporation is subject to regulation by the state of new york  where the insurance company is domiciled  as well as all other states where the insurance company transacts business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and furnish to it financial and other information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
the corporation has registered as a holding company system in new york 
the laws and regulations of new york applicable to insurance holding companies require  among other things  that all transactions within a holding company system be fair and equitable and that charges for services be equitable 
in addition  many transactions require prior notification to or approval of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the superintendent 
prior written approval of the superintendent is required for the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the insurance companies voting securities 
applicable state insurance laws  rather than federal bankruptcy laws  also apply to the liquidation or reorganization of insurance companies 
the insurance company is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory agencies of the states in which it is authorized to transact business 
state insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers 
principal among these powers are granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating marketing and other trade practices  operating guaranty associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating premium rates  regulating insurance holding company systems  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  performing financial  market conduct and other examinations  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  defining acceptable accounting principles  regulating the type  valuation and amount of investments permitted  and limiting the a mount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval 
one of the requirements is that the insurance company performs annual cash flow testing of its assets and liabilities 
based on the testing performed  the insurance company held an asset liability reserve of million at year end  million at year end and million at year end  for statutory accounting purposes only  to address the risk of a substantial increase in surrenders in a rising interest rate environment 
the insurance company is required to file detailed periodic reports and financial statements with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which it does business 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurance company s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with the insurance department rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  the new york state insurance department nysid generally conducts detailed examinations of the books  records and accounts of the insurance company every three years 
the insurance company is currently undergoing an examination covering the three year period ending december  the final report has not yet been issued 
prior to this  an examination occurred during for the three year period ending december  the final report was issued on april  during that review  concerns were raised regarding the duration of the supporting assets relative to the duration of liabilities and the risks this posed under increasing interest rate scenarios 
in response  as described above  the insurance company implemented an asset liability management strategy  which included additional statutory reserves  a rebalancing of its portfolio and the purchase of payor swaption investments 
no other significant issues or adjustments were noted 
statutory reporting practices the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the new york state insurance department 
the new york state insurance department has adopted the provisions of the naic s statutory accounting practices as the basis for its statutory practices 
accounting practices used to prepare statutory financial statements for regulatory filings of stock life insurance companies differ in certain instances from gaap 
the following are the major differences between statutory accounting principles sap and gaap sap  unlike gaap  utilizes asset valuation reserves and interest maintenance reserves  which are intended to stabilize surplus from fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio 
future policy benefits and policyholders account balances under sap differ from gaap due to differences between actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies 
certain policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  sales inducements  and certain expenses related to policy issuance and underwriting are expensed as incurred under sap  but are deferred under gaap and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies or based on past and projected profits to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses 
under gaap  deferred federal income taxes provide for temporary differences  which are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in a different period than for federal income tax purposes 
deferred taxes are also recognized in statutory accounting practices  however  there are limitations as to the amount of deferred tax assets that may be reported as admitted assets 
the change in the deferred taxes is recorded in surplus  rather than as a component of income tax expense 
for statutory accounting purposes  all of the company s debt securities are recorded at amortized cost  except for securities in or near default  which are reported at fair value 
under gaap  they are carried at amortized cost or fair value based on their classification as either held to maturity or available for sale 
certain assets  such as furniture and equipment  agents debit balances  and prepaid expenses  are not admissible under sap but are admissible under gaap 
under sap  premiums from universal life and deferred annuities are recognized as premium when received 
under gaap  the premiums received are recorded as an increase in liability for policyholder account balances 
regulation of dividends and other payments from the insurance company the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no other business operations  its primary sources of cash needed to meet its obligations  including principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness and dividend payments on its common stock  are rent from its real estate  income from its investments and dividends from the insurance company 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under new york law  the insurance company is permitted  without prior insurance regulatory clearance  to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year  or ii its net gain after tax from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
any dividend in excess of such amount is subject to approval by the superintendent 
the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has established informa l guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines focus on  among other things  an insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices  which  as discussed above  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
in  the insurance company paid million in stockholder dividends to the corporation 
however  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in subsequent years 
accordingly  management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have adequate statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements  including the payment of dividends  or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
in  the insurance company would be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend of million to the corporation without prior regulatory clearance 
investment reserves asset valuation reserve statutory accounting practices require a life insurance company to maintain an asset valuation reserve avr to absorb realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on a portion of an insurer s fixed income securities and equity securities 
the avr is required to stabilize statutory surplus from fluctuations in the market value of bonds  stocks  mortgages  real estate  and other long term investments 
the maximum avr is calculated based on the application of various factors that are applied to the assets in the insurer s portfolio 
the avr generally captures credit related realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on such assets 
each year the amount of an insurer s avr will fluctuate as the investment portfolio changes and capital gains and losses are absorbed by the reserve 
to adjust for such changes over time  contributions must be made to the avr in an aggregate amount equal to of the difference between the maximum avr as calculated and the actual avr 
these contributions may result in a slower rate of growth in or a reduction of the insurance company s surplus 
the extent of the impact of the avr on the insurance company s surplus depends in part on the future composition of the insurance company s investment portfolio 
interest maintenance reserve the interest maintenance reserve imr captures capital gains and losses net of taxes on fixed income investments primarily bonds and mortgage loans resulting from interest rate changes  which are amortized into net income over the estimated remaining periods to maturity of the investments sold 
the extent of the impact of the imr depends on the amount of future capital gains and losses on fixed maturity investments resulting from interest rate changes 
naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and primarily is intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies normal ranges for each ratio 
the iris ratios were designed to advise state insurance regulators of significant changes in an insurance company s product mix  large reinsurance transactions  increases or decreases in premiums received and certain other changes in operations 
these changes need not result from any problems with an insurance company  but merely indicate changes in certain ratios outside ranges defined as normal by the naic 
when an insurance company has four or more ratios falling outside normal ranges  state regul ators may  but are not obligated to  inquire of the company regarding the nature of the company s business to determine the reasons for the ratios being outside the normal range 
no regulatory significance results from being out of the normal range on fewer than four of the ratios 
for the year ended december   two ratios  change in premium and change in reserve ratio life fell outside the normal range 
the change in premium was primarily attributable to a decrease in annuity considerations 
the change in reserve ratio fell outside of the normal range primarily due to the establishment of an additional reserve on the guaranteed issue business as well as lower reserves released by death and surrenders on the single premium whole life business 
for the year ended december   one ratio  change in reserve ratio life fell outside the normal range 
this was primarily attributable to a s ignificant increase in surrenders and death claims on the single premium whole life product in when compared to  which  in turn  accounted for a lower reserve increase of approximately million in when compared to risk based capital under the naic s risk based capital formula  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
the standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount  which then is compared to a company s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset default  adverse insurance experience  disintermediation and external events 
this information is intended to permit insurance regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
the naic formula provides for four levels of potential involvement by state regulators for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  ranging from a requirement for an insurance company to submit a plan to improve its capital company action level to regulatory c ontrol of the insurance company mandatory control level 
at december   the insurance company s company action level was million and the mandatory control level was million 
the insurance company s adjusted capital at december  and was million and million  respectively  which exceeds all four action levels 
assessments against insurers most applicable jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in guaranty funds  which are designed to indemnify policyholders of insolvent insurance companies 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions generally are subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s insolvency and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the amount of these assessments against the insurance company in and prior years have not been material 
however  the amount and timing of any future assessment against the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the corporation and the insurance company 
as such  no reasonable estimate of such assessments can be made 
regulation at federal level although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and any future federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such congressional activity or the potential effects thereof on the corporation 
environmental considerations as an owner and operator of real property  the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties 
we cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise 
however  based on information currently available to management  we believe that any costs associated with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
enterprise risk management the company has adopted an enterprise risk management erm policy as a methodology for managing risks 
management is exploring the use of robust capital modeling as an alternative to an economic capital framework  to support decision making 
in addition  management has developed a roadmap in order to improve its identification of key risks to strategic objectives  clarify governance structure  and identify potential gaps that may exist in current risk management 
by creating a more structured framework  optimizing investment decision making and identifying major risks  management believes erm will play an important role in the company s efforts to create and preserve shareholder value 
the company continues to engage tillinghast as consultants to support our efforts in this endeavor

risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect the corporation s business  financial results and results of operations 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
any or all forward looking statements may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many such factors will be important in determining our actual future results 
these statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment 
they involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
among factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in general economic conditions  including the performance of financial markets and interest rates the corporation is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
while the corporation attempts to obtain a desired return on its investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk  there can be no guarantee that its strategies will be successful 
defaults on fixed maturities and a downturn in the market may diminish the value of the company s invested assets and adversely affect its sales  profitability and investment returns 
the corporation attempts to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the profitability and financial condition of its fixed annuity operations through the rebalancing of its portfolio and payor swaption investments see item  asset liability management 
there can be no guarantee that its strategies will be successful 
during a period of rising interest rates  annuity contract surrenders and withdrawals may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns 
despite its efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates  the company may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such surrenders and withdrawals  thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold 
an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals may also require the company to accelerate amortization of policy acquisition costs relating to these contracts  which would further reduce its net income 
during periods of declining interest rates  borrowers may prepay or redeem bonds that the company owns  which would force it to reinvest the proceeds at lowered interest rates 
the company s general account products generally contain minimum interest rate guarantees 
these minimum guarantees may constrain the company s ability to lower credited rates in response to lower investment returns 
therefore  it may be more difficult for the company to maintain its desired spread between the investment income it earns and the interest it credits to its customers  thereby reducing its profitability 
investment in limited partnerships as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over seventy limited partnerships  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including real estate  debt restructurings  international opportunities and merchant banking 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships that it has received during the past periods or that it will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the insurance company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is invested in over limited partnerships  which are managed by various general partners 
the company is aware of partnerships that had maintained profitable short positions in sub prime related positions  but is not aware of any direct sub prime exposures  which might result in a material loss 
performance in certain partnerships with investments in financial institutions with sub prime exposure would have been negatively impacted 
heightened competition  including with respect to pricing  entry of new competitors and the development of new products by new and existing competitors the insurance company operates in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms  and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with the insurance company  many of which are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than the insurance company 
the insurance company believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating  and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in the insurance company s target markets 
management believes that the insurance company s ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  its ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market its products and to successfully develop competitive  profitable products 
management believes that the insurance company has good relationships with its agents  has an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and generally is competitive within the industry in all applicable areas 
our primary reliance  as a holding company  on sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate to meet debt payment obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments the corporation is a holding company and  therefore  depends on dividends  distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations  including debt obligations 
the insurance company is subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from the insurance company to the corporation 
regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that the corporation needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations  or dividend payments 
an inability of the corporation to access funds from its subsidiaries could adversely affect its ability to meet its obligations 
adverse results from litigation  arbitration or regulatory investigations financial services companies are frequently the targets of litigation  including class action litigation  which could result in substantial judgments 
regulatory  accounting or tax changes that may affect the cost of  or demand for  our products or services the company s insurance business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the united states by both state and federal regulators 
the primary purpose of state regulation of the insurance business is to protect contract owners  and not necessarily to protect other constituencies of the insurance company  such as creditors or shareholders 
state insurance regulators  state attorneys general  the national association of insurance commissioners  the securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers nasd continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and may impose changes in the future 
changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation  financial services regulation  and federal taxation could lessen the advantages of certain of the company s products as compared to competing pr oducts  or possibly result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies or reduced sales of new products and  therefore  could reduce the company s profitability 
the adoption of new laws or regulations  enforcement action or litigation  whether or not involving the company  could influence the manner in which it distributes its insurance products  which could adversely impact the company 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
downgrades in our claims paying ability  financial strength or credit ratings ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
a downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  of any of the ratings for the company could  among other things materially increase the number of annuity contract surrenders and withdrawals  result in the termination of relationships with broker dealers  banks  agents  wholesalers  and other distributors of the company s products and services  and reduce new sales of annuity contracts or increase the minimum interest rate the company may be required to pay under new annuity contracts 
any of these consequences could adversely affect the company s profitability and financial condition 
changes in rating agency policies or practices rating organizations assign ratings based upon numerous factors 
while most of the factors relate to the rated company  some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization  general economic conditions  and circumstances outside the rated company s control 
in addition  rating organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess financial strength of a rated company  and from time to time rating organizations have  in their discretion  altered the models 
changes to the models  general economic conditions  or circumstances outside the company s control could impact a rating organization s judgment and the subsequent rating it assigns the company 
the company cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take  or what actions it may be required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations  which could adversely affect the company 
reliance on general agents the independent general agent system is the insurance company s primary product distribution system 
the insurance company utilizes many general agents to distribute its products and therefore  is not dependent on any one general agent or agent for a substantial amount of its business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of the insurance company s sales in no single gene ral agent accounted for more than and no single agent accounted for more than of total sales 
management believes no single distribution source loss will have a material adverse impact on the insurance company 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales unless these sources are timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  the insurance company continuously recruits new independent general agents 
a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure could impair our liquidity  disrupt our businesses  damage our reputation and cause losses shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
for example  our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions 
the transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
our financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that sup ports our businesses or the community in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations  which could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subjec t to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense 
in addition  competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals has been intense 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees  an inability to do so may impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or remediate inefficiencies 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur 
it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
discrepancies between actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for our obligations for future policy benefits and claims the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
while the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions  there can be no guarantee that futur e estimates and assumptions will not significantly deviate from actual results 
our business my be adversely affected if the decline in annuity contracts in force were to continue for an extended period of time the declining trend in annuity inforce primarily reflects unusually large volumes of business written in thru these contracts started to come off surrender charge at the end of  through the end of  at a relatively large expected surrender rate 
this large volume of surrenders outpaced new sales causing a general decline in total annuity inforce 
the company believes that the heavy surrender activity is now largely behind us and  along with expected new sales  there should be a turn around in the inforce this year 
additionally  management has increased the incentive for agents to retain this business with the company by paying full first year compensation on internal rollovers

item legal proceedings from time to time  the corporation is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business

in and  the company undertook programs designed to rebalance a portion of its fixed income portfolio see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
this portfolio rebalancing resulted in a decreased yield on assets  as long term  higher yielding assets were sold with the proceeds being reinvested in shorter term assets with lower yields 
the sale of the long term assets resulted in approximately million of capital gains in in and  the purchases of new fixed income assets from portfolio rebalancing resulted in decreased income from investments 
also  during and  the company experienced a decline in overall assets due to a substantial increase in annuity surrenders mill ion in and million in  compared to million in resulting in an overall decline in total assets 
despite these trends  net income improved to million in from million in  as invested yields stabilized while credited rates on rollover annuities fell substantially 
this improvement in net investment margin combined with an increase in income from the company s limited partnership investments resulted in improved earnings performance in as described under ratings and regulation  the corporation s business is substantially affected by capital ratios and their impact on its ratings 
consequently  the insurance company s management established a policy of reducing the level of sales increases until capital and surplus ratios are further improved 
sales are also being made with a greater selectivity based on increased profit level requirements for new business 
the insurance company has determined that the level of competition in the sale of traditional and universal life insurance products has made it very difficult for smaller insurance companies  such as the insurance company  to participate in this business in a profitable way 
accordingly  the insurance company has determined that  under the current market conditions  it will not participate in the sale of traditional and universal life policies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the insurance company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with three primary lines of business individual annuities  individual life insurance  and group accident and health 
revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts  life and accident and health products  and gains or losses  from our investment portfolio 
as described in item a  since the insurance company has suspended the sale of traditional and universal life insurance due to existing market conditions 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingent annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
for these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the insurance company s individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health depends largely on the size of its inforce block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claim and expense management 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
when we use the term we  us and our we mean the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below under certain factors that may affect our business and under risk factors see ite m a 
executive overview results the corporation s earnings per share were for  as compared to in and in results in and reflect decreases in both investment income and net realized investment gains from our total revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in the corporation s decreases in earning and revenues in and resulted primarily from decreases in net investment income and realized capital gains 
lower yields from the portfolio rebalancing see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management  a loss on the payor swaptions reflected in the realized capital gains  and decreased investment income from the corporation s partnership investments all contributed to lower revenues in and certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risk 
a summary of these factors is set below market conditions the corporation  like all companies  is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
despite certain recent improvements in business conditions  the business environment in recent years has been difficult and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk has been challenging 
this  in turn  has had an impact on our willingness to expand sales of our single premium annuity products 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on how we deal with the regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk business is dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any internal failures in the internal processes  people  or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the corporation 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk the insurance company s principal products are deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates the insurance company s annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity to seek alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
as of december   the existence of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect for up to the first years of each annuity policy and  therefore  disappear over time see table below 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  the insurance company may have to sell off longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
the insurance company continually develops strategies to address the match between the timing of its assets and liabilities 
to that end  in and  a significant number of policies came off surrender charge and a significant portion of this business did surrender 
this can be seen in the surrender ratio in the table on page the company anticipated this and increased liquidity  maintaining significant levels of cash equivalents to fund surrenders 
due to the relatively flat or inverted yield curve during much of this time  this increased level of liquidity resulted in a relatively small reduction of income 
the company believes that the heavy surrender activity is now largely behind us and  along with expected new sales  there should be a turn around in the inforce thi s year 
additionally  management has increased the incentive for agents to retain this business with the company by paying full first year compensation on internal rollovers 
beginning in  a significantly smaller amount of business will be coming off surrender charge as shown in the table below and consequently we expect a significant reduction in the surrender ratio 
during and  especially in light of the substantial number of policies coming off surrender charges in those years and in  the insurance company reduced the amount of assets invested in longer term investments by approximately  million and reinvested in short and intermediate return investments at reduced yields 
these reduced yields were partially offset by the gains recognized by the insurance company from the sale of the longer term assets 
to protect against a substantial sudden increase in rates basis points  the company has entered into a series of payor swaption in vestments 
under these investments  the company obtained the right to enter into interest rate swap agreements with counterparties under which the company s interest rate obligations are fixed and the counterparties obligations are variable  thus protecting the company from sudden rate increases 
see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that the insurance company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders can either surrender policies or cause their policies to lapse by failing to pay premiums 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the insurance company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes the insurance company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment gains losses average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets including accrued investment income minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
a general improvement in market conditions and an increase in net investment income were the primary factors in the increase from to portfolio rebalancing and the decline in total assets in and resulting from annuity surrenders exceeding net premium written contributed to the decline in net investment income in net investment margin the difference between the return on invested assets and credited rates paid on annuities improved during and is expected to favorably impact results in the sale of long term bonds to support the portfolio rebalancing in resulted in million in realized capital gains 
during  a loss of million on the payor swaption portfolio combined with a decline in security sales resulted in a decline to million in net realized investment gains 
the company had net realized investment gains of million in  due primarily to the premiums from optionally called trust preferred securities 
another major factor affecting profitability is the level of expenses 
management believes that one of the insurance company s strengths is its concentration on minimizing expenses through periodic review and adjustment of general and administrative costs 
investments the insurance company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the insurance company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the insurance company are governed by the statement of investment policy established and approved by the investment committee  the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and the corporation and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and corporation 
the insurance company s statement of investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the insurance company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the insurance company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the insurance company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the insurance company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the insurance company s investment policies to reflect changes in the insurance company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the insurance company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the insurance company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
these strategies included the investments in payor swaptions  described be low 
the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
management evaluates whether other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
inherent in management s evaluation of each security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the insurance company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairme nts of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
nbsp  the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the insurance company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions relied upon by the insurance company will yield accurate assessments of the fair value of these investments 
as such  the insurance company reassesses its assumptions regularly 
as of december   of the company s invested assets approximately million consisted of short term commercial paper and corporate bonds and us agencies with maturities of less than year at the time of purchase 
the commercial paper  which totaled approximately million at december   consisted of direct obligations of various corporations rated a minimum of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s with maturities of less than days 
the fixed income securities with less than year to maturity approximately million consisted primarily of investment grade corporate bonds which  as of december   had quality ratings except for one of at least a by moody s and a by standard and poor s 
as part of its asset liability management strategy  the insurance company has kept elevated levels of cash or cash equivalent investments since  anticipating the potential surrender of annui ty policies with expiring surrender charges 
this cash has been available to meet actual surrenders and any other cash needs 
by having the liquidity afforded by these cash investments during  the company has been able to satisfy all cash needs without portfolio sales from the fixed income portfolio 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other long term investments 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the insurance company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
commitments of million will expire in  million in  in  in and in the insurance company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the primary market risks in the insurance company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk discussed above  credit risk and  to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
changes in credit risk are generally measured by changes in corporate yields in relation to the underlying treasuries corporate spreads as well as changes in the credit default swap cds market  although the company is a cash investor and does not buy or sell credit default swaps 
the insurance company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant 
the insurance company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the corporation s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the insurance company could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin

unrealized losses the following table presents the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and common stock where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost at december  less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses description of securities in thousands us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies corporate bonds preferred stocks subtotal fixed maturities common stock total the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by december  gross unrealized losses of total in thousands less than twelve months twelve months or more total at december   the company owned securities with a net unrealized loss position 
notwithstanding an overall decrease in the number of securities in an unrealized loss position at the end of from to  there was an increase in the amount of the unrealized losses for months or more 
the number of securities with unrealized losses greater than months decreased to from while the number of securities with unrealized losses less than months increased from to approximately of the securities with unrealized losses greater than months are corporate bonds 
the average unrealized loss at december  has increased to of book value from for the prior year 
a combination of factors contributed to the overall increase in unrealized losses for corporate bonds at december  corporate spreads widened substantially  with year bbb rated spreads increasing from basis points over year treasuries at december  to basis points at december   according to the merrill lynch corporate indices 
five year bbb rated corporate spreads widened from at year end to at december  unrealized losses in bank and financial issues increased due to concerns about the sub prime mortgage market and widening corporate spreads 
spreads on year a rated financials increased from at year end to at year end losses were further increased for bank trust preferreds and preferreds by year end tax loss selling 
this situation improved subsequent to december   as many of the trust preferreds and preferred issues saw an increase in market value by more than over year end levels 
the company addresses other than temporary impairment issues consistent with its policy as described on page us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us agencies the net unrealized loss on us treasuries and us agencies totaled  on a fair value position of million at december  this represented a substantial improvement from the million unrealized loss at year end  reflecting the substantial decline in treasury yields during corporate bonds the predominant investment category for the company s investments is the corporate bond category including public utilities  which totaled billion at december  the million of unrealized losses at december   an increase from million at december   reflected the general widening of corporate spreads in the largest unrealized loss positions consisted of the following holdings gmac due november   countrywide capital iii  due june   knight ridder assumed by mcclatchy company  due november   limited brands  due november   and ford motor credit  due january  the gmac unrealized loss reflected concerns about sub prime mortgages at its residential capital llc subsidiary 
the unrealized loss in countrywide capital represented the significant deterioration of the residential mortgage market and its effect on countrywide  the takeover bid that countrywide subsequently received from bank of america has narrowed this unrealized loss 
knight ridder suffered from the widening in corporate spreads combined with the mcclatchy rating downgrades in below investment grade by s p and fitch 
the limited brands holding reflects a significant book value position million that experienced a widening in credit spreads combined with cyclical concerns about the retailing sector 
the ford motor credit position is a significant book value position million that has been hurt by cyclical concerns about automobile and truck sales 
preferred stocks the preferred stock category  which totaled million at december   consists primarily of banks  financial companies  electric utilities and reit s real estate investment trusts 
unrealized losses totaled million at year end  primarily reflecting the decline in the market value of financial company preferreds 
the market also experienced a significant decline due to year end tax loss selling 
the largest unrealized loss positions consisted of the following holdings royal bank of scotland  pfd l  lehman brothers capital trust v  equity residential pfd series n  bre properties pfd series c  and duke realty pfd series k 
the royal bank of scotland and the lehman brothers positions were affected by general concerns about the us residential real estate market and the effect on loans and investments in sub prime mortgages and collateralized bond obligations back ed by sub prime mortgages 
the equity residential  bre properties and duke realty issues were generally affected by the tax loss selling noted previously 
all three of these preferreds are currently trading at market values that are more than higher than december  common stocks the company had  of unrealized losses at december  a significant portion of this unrealized loss reflects a decline in market value of a common stock position in i star financial  inc  a residential reit 
statutory information the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the new york state insurance department 
prescribed sap include state laws  regulations and general administrative rules  as well as a variety of publications from the naic 
accounting principles used to prepare statutory financial statements differ from financial statements prepared on the basis of gaap 
see item  business  insurance regulation  statutory reporting practices a reconciliation of the insurance company s net income loss as filed with regulatory authorities to net income reported in the accompanying financial statements for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table in thousands statutory net income reconciling items deferred policy acquisition costs investment income difference gaap deferred taxes policy liabilities and accruals imr amortization imr capital gains payor swaptions federal income taxes other non insurance company s net income gaap net income a reconciliation of the insurance company s shareholders equity as filed with regulatory authorities to shareholders equity reported in the accompanying financial statements as of december is set forth in the following table in thousands statutory shareholders equity reconciling items asset valuation and interest maintenance reserves investment valuation differences deferred policy acquisition costs policy liabilities and accruals difference between statutory and gaap deferred taxes other non insurance company s shareholders equity gaap shareholders equity agency ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the corporation s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted 
in february  am best company reaffirmed the insurance company s rating at b good 
at the time of the b rating  publications of am best indicated that the b rating was assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
the b rating is within a 
m best s secure classification  along with a  a  a  a  and b ratings 
in  am best company changed the financial strength rating descriptor for b and b ratings on insurance companies from very good to good 
the change was made to make the rating descriptor consistent with the existing rating definitio n and did not  in any way  represent a change in am best s opinion of the company 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
in may  moody s investor services moody s reaffirmed the insurance company s insurance financial strength at ba questionable financial security with a stable outlook  and its rating on the corporation s senior notes at b poor financial security  with a stable outlook 
in march  standard poor s corporation standard poor s raised the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from a bb which is defined as a vulnerability to the broad array of risks that are embedded in its investment and operational profile to a bb  which is defined as marginal financial security with positive attributes  but adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments 
in march  standard poors raised the credit rating of the senior notes from a b weak financial security  adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments to a b weak financial security  adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments with a stable outlook 
in july  fitch ratings assigned the insurance company an aq rating  strong  possessing strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations based solely on the company s stand alone financial statement characteristics 
fitch ratings found that risk factors are moderate  and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be small 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year operating revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately and increased from approximately million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
life insurance premiums were million  million and million in  and respectively 
annuity considerations decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million  and increased from approximately million in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
these amounts do not include consideration from the sales of deferred annuities or immediate annuities without life contingencies 
under gaap  such sales are reported as additions to policyholder account balances 
consideration from such sal es was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
several factors attributed to the decrease of annuity premium considerations 
the continued repressive interest environment beginning in has been persistent causing annuity carriers to credit relatively lower and unattractive rates of interest versus the banking savings market which enjoyed a favorable yield curve advantage throughout liquidity is at a premium  as the economy appears to continue slipping towards recession creating an unfavorable environment for the purchase of annuity contracts 
the company s diminished am best  standard and poors  and moody s ratings from the levels remain a significant contributory factor to the annuity premium slowdown 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income remained stable at approximately million in fiscal years and  but decreased to approximately million in fiscal year policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in this represents a decrease comparing to and a decrease comparing to invested assets  at amortized cost  for  and totaled billion  billion and billion  respectively 
this decrease in invested assets was primarily caused by an increase in policy surrenders in the insurance company s annuity business which exceeded the level of new annuity sales for the respective periods 
reduced income resulted from a decrease in invested assets  as well as  the income reduction attributable to portfolio rebalancing activities in and  which involved the sale of higher yielding long term assets and the reinvestment into lower yielding short term investments 
the insurance company s ratios of net investment income to average cash and invested assets  at amort ized cost  for the years ended december   and were approximately  and  respectively 
income from limited partnership investments amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the changes in the amounts are largely reflective of the inherent volatility of income in the company s limited partnership portfolio 
see item  management s discussion and analysis  asset liability management 
without taking into account the corporation s returns on its limited partnership investments in those years  the respective ratios would have been  and for the years ended december   and for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains losses pre tax amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in was primarily attributable to gains on fixed maturities 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to recorded losses on the insurance company s investment in payor swaptions 
due to accounting rules governing these investments  fluctuations in market value are realized in the income statement  even if the investments continued to be held by the company 
the values of the payor swaptions were  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the decrease in investment gains from to was largely attributable to gains from the portfolio rebalancing activities in net realized investment gains for years ended december   and include realized investment losses of approximately thousand  million  and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the insurance company s investment portfolio that were deemed by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
for a discussion of the procedure by which such determinations were made  see investments above 
realized investment gains losses also resulted from sales of certain equities and convertible securities and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investment portfolio 
total benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits paid to policyholders amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these represent a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease comparing fiscal to fiscal these amounts are consistent with the company s historic expense levels 
the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances for the years ended december   and was less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets based on book value for the same period as noted above under net investment income 
although management does not currently expect material declines in the spread between the company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the company s ratio of net investment income to book value mean assets the spread  there can be no assurance that the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general and the company  in particular  the company may  from time to time  change the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce such rates or that any such reductions will widen the spread 
the actual spread  excluding capital gains  for the for the months ended december   and was  and  respectively 
in comparing year end to year end  the increase was primarily due to a decrease in the crediting rate 
from to  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the earned rate  partially offset by a decrease in the crediting rate 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the corporation s notes payable amounted to approximately million in  approximately million in and approximately million in general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled million in as compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of comparing to and an increase of comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase in was primarily due to refunds in state and franchise taxes  which reduced the taxes in that year 
consultant fees paid in connection with the company s erm project also contributed to the increase in the increase in was primarily due to increased commissions paid on internal rollovers in an effort to keep policies in force 
change in deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for resulted in a charge of approximately million  as compared to a charge of approximately million and a charge of approximately million for and  respectively 
changes in dac consist of three elements deferred costs associated with product sales  amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business and amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business 
deferred costs consisted of credits of million  million and million for  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business consisted of charges of million  million and million in  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business consisted of charges of million in and million in both and under applicable accounting rules fasb  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
the increase in relates to an increase in realized gains in the decrease from to was primarily due to a substantial decrease in the realized gains  a direct result of the company s portfolio rebalancing program in see also the discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under critical accounting policies below 
income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income before income taxes amounted to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in income taxes income tax expense was approximately million in  as compared to an expense of approximately million in and approximately million in higher income in generated higher taxes 
the decrease in income taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net realized investment loss in net income for the reasons discussed above  the corporation had net income of approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in liquidity and capital resources the corporation is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the corporation s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate 
in  the corporation s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend rate to 
per share from 
per share in and during and  the corporation did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the corporation was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the corporation without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will only be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the supe rintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
the insurance company paid million and million in dividends to the corporation in fiscal and  respectively 
no dividends were paid to the corporation in on a going forward basis  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the corporation in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the corporation was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in and the foreseeable future 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
net cash provided by the corporation s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in in the corporation s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased  called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for purposes of the corporation s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the corporation to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash used in provided by the insurance company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to changes in policyholder account balances as a result of surrenders  sales and interest earned by the policyholders as well as the repayment of short term debt 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the corporation 
in the event the corporation violates such covenants  we may be obligated to offer to repurchase the entire outstanding principal amount of such notes 
as of december   we believe that we are in compliance with all of the covenants 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
annuitants may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and were surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent concern of the insurance company s management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of its invested assets and the duration of its contractual liabilities to its annuity holders and credit suppliers 
prior to  the insurance company had permitted the duration gap between its assets and liabilities to rise during a period in which it expected relatively stable interest rates and  most importantly  in which its liabilities were largely protected by significant annuity surrender charges 
this strategy benefited the company by allowing it to realize enhanced yield from longer duration assets 
at the end of  the insurance company determined that the prospect of rising rates and declining surrender charges necessitated a reduction in the duration mismatch  as well as increased management of extension risk in its investment portfolio 
the company developed a two step asset liability managem ent strategy 
the first step involved a duration reduction strategy  which involved the sale of certain longer duration assets that were purchased at prices below current market prices and reinvestment in shorter duration assets 
since december   the company has completed in excess of  million of asset repositioning 
as the second element of the asset liability management strategy  the company hedged against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as payor swaptions 
swaptions are options to enter into an interest rate swap arrangement with a counterparty at a specified future date 
at expiration  the counterparty would be required to pay the insurance company the amount of the present value of the difference between the floating rate of interest based on month libor on the swap agreement and a specified strike rate in the agreement multiplied by the notional amount of the swap agreement 
the effect of these transactions would be to lessen the negative impact on the insurance company of a significant increase in interest rates 
the company may monetize the value of expiring payor swaptions prior to the expiration date 

in july  presidential life entered into a series of payor swaption investments designed to protect the company against an instantaneous rise in interest rates of basis points  as required by the new york state insurance department regulation 
six contracts against the year swap rate were executed with one dealer and three banks at a total cost of  during the rd quarter of presidential sold the expiring payor swaption for  realizing a capital gain of  the proceeds were reinvested into a new payor swaption with a notional value of  increased from the  notional value for the expiring payor swaption that expires on july   for a total cash consideration of  during the nd quarter of  the insurance company sold of the swaptions set to expire in july realizing a capital loss of  these proceeds were reinvested into a new payor swaption with a notional amount of  that expires on june  the company has established isda credit support agreements with the three current counterparties 
all of the counterparties have ratings equal to or higher than aa aa by moody s and s p  respectively 
these contracts expire in july  july  and june at varying strike rates based on the year swap rate 
the company has determined that the payor swaptions represent a non qualified hedge and has adopted accounting procedures consistent with the provisions of fas the aggregate market value of the payor swaptions as of december  was  these investments are classified on the balance sheet as derivative instruments 
under fas  the value of the payor swaptions is recognized at fair value market value  with the resulting change in fair value reflected in the statement of income as a realized loss or gain 
the change in market value during the calendar year was a loss of  the company has determined that the average fair value  based upon weekly market values for the period january  to december   was  the insurance company  in consultation with its actuarial consultant  milliman  inc  periodically assesses its overall swaption portfolio to determine if sufficient protection is provided to cover projected realized losses in the event of a liquidation of assets to satisfy annuity surrenders under the aforementioned basis points increase in interest rates 
as part of this process  presidential believes that its existing swaption portfolio currently provides excess protection against a basis points rise in interest rates 
the company may consider liquidating some of the swaption portfolio or allowing the nearby payor swaptions maturing in to expire 
future consideration of these transactions or other asset liability management strategies is dependent upon periodic testing based on updated asset and liability data as of december  line of credit the short term note payable relates to a bank line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank which had been in the amount of  bank line and provided for interest on borrowings based on market indices 
at december  the company had  outstanding 
the bank line was up for renewal on july   however  on july   the company paid down the full  bank line with available cash 
the proceeds from the bank line had previously been used as an arbitrage facility to purchase higher yielding investments 
the company decided to pay off the bank line because due to the increased cost of the bank line it no longer provided a positive spread to the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the corporation s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contain information regarding payments required under existing long term borrowing arrangements 
the following presents a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations table payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations policy liabilities total contractual obligations the difference between the recorded liability of  million  and the total payment obligation amount of  million  is  million and is comprised of i future interest to be credited  ii the effect of mortality discount for those payments that are life contingent  and iii the impact of surrender charges on those contracts that have such charges 
of the total payment of  million   million  or  is from the company s deferred annuity  life  and accident and health business 
determining the timing of these payments involves significant uncertainties  including mortality  morbidity  persistency  investment returns  and the timing of policyholder surrender 
notwithstanding these uncertainties  the table reflects an estimate of the timing of such payments 
long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due february  see note in notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financials statements for additional discussion concerning both long term and short term obligations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the insurance company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the insurance company s fixed maturity portfolio would be expected to decrease  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the insurance company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the insurance company s cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the monetization of the payor swaption investments described a bove and the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the insurance company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the insurance company s investments that are designated as available for sale in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the insurance company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the insurance company s products until the insurance company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the insurance company s customers 
in that regard  in the current inte rest rate environment  the insurance company has attempted to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  item o  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the new accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on the results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the corporation s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the insurance company s business operations 
investments the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent i n management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii financial difficulties being experienced by an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv economically depressed geographic locations  v situations where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
however  the company believes that the estimates it uses in determining other than temporary impairment and fair value are realistic  conservative and fairly state the value of its investments 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in limited partnership interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest  or more than a minor influence over the joint ventures and partnership s operations  but does not have a controlling interest and is not the primary beneficiary 
the company routinely evaluates its limited partnership investments for impairments 
the company considers financial and other information provided by the investee and other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments in determining whether an impairment has occurred 
when an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred  the company records a realized capital loss within net investment income to record the investment at its fair value 
investment income from limited partnerships is recorded based on the company s share of earnings reported in the partnership s most recent audit ed financial statements and income distributed by the partnerships 
management considers the quarterly financial information received from the limited partnerships to be unreliable or insufficient to record investment income  other than from distributions  on a quarterly basis 
management estimates the classification of cash distributions received between investment income and return of capital based on correspondence from the respective partnerships 
the company adjusts its estimate of investment income recorded during the year to the actual realized gains and other income reported in the limited partnerships most recent annual audited financial statements  which are generally received in the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  there may be up to a one year reporting lag for recording investment income that is not distributed during the year  which may result in significant adjustments 
the company records its share of net unrealized gains and losses net of taxes from the audited financial statements of the limited partnerships 
as a result  there may be up to a one year reporting lag for reporting unrealized gains and losses  which may result in significant adjustments to other comprehensive income in because it is not practicable to obtain an independent valuation for each limited partnership interest  for purposes of disclosure the market value of a limited partnership interest is estimated at book value based on the most recent available audited financial statements 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
under applicable accounting rules  these costs  which vary  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
to demonstrate the sensitivity of our net dac balance million as of december  relative to our future spreads and expenses  the information below indicates how much the net dac balance would have changed if the future spread assumption decreased by and if the future expense assumption increased by 
we believe that any variation in our expense or spread estimate is likely to fall within these ranges 
change in assumption decrease in net dac asset future spread decreases million future expenses increase million future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
for policies and contracts where the reserve is reported as the account balance  million  a change in expected experience would have no effect on the reserve 
for those annuities and supplementary contracts with life contingencies that comprise a portion of future policy benefits million of reserves  an increase in mortality experience of per year for individual contracts would increase the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
we believe that any variation of our mortality estimates is likely to fall within this range 
for traditional life insurance business million of reserves  establishing reserves requires the use of many assumptions 
due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of these reserves  and because this business is not material to the overall company results  it is not practical to perform a quantitative analysis on the impact of changes in underlying assumptions 
however  the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions and believes that its assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with gaap 
income taxes income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 for all years presented we use the asset and liability method to record deferred income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized that reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  using enacted tax rates 
such temporary differences are primarily due to tax basis of reserves for future policy benefits  deferred acquisition costs  and net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
fin liabilities and tax reserves we have open tax years in the united states that are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authorities  and certain later tax years that may in the future be subject to examination 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of our fin liabilities and tax reserves  taking into account our open tax return positions  tax assessments received and tax law changes 
the process of evaluating fin liabilities and tax reserves involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
the final determination of tax audits could affect our tax reserves
