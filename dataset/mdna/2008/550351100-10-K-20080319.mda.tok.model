item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we research  develop and commercialize innovative technologies in two primary areas of focus test measurement  sensing  and instrumentation products and health care products 
we have a disciplined and integrated business model that is designed to accelerate the process of bringing new and innovative products to market 
we identify technologies that can fulfill large and unmet market needs and then take these technologies from the applied research stage through commercialization 
although revenues from product sales currently represent less than half of our total revenues  we continue to invest in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
in the future  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues 
in addition  we anticipate that  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products as we develop and commercialize new products 
we have developed a disciplined and integrated process to accelerate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies 
our business model employs a market driven approach and provides the infrastructure  resources and know how throughout the process of developing and commercializing new products 
to manage a diverse set of products effectively across a range of development stages  we are organized into two main groups our technology development division and our products division 
these groups work together through all product development stages  including searching for emerging technologies based on market needs  conducting applied research  developing and commercializing innovative products  and applying proven technologies and products to new market opportunities 
our annual revenues were million in  million in  and million in we generate revenues through technology development services provided under contractual arrangements  product sales and license fees 
historically  our technology development revenues have accounted for a large and growing proportion of our total revenues  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our technology development revenues grew from million in  to million in and million in we have historically had a backlog of contracts for which work has been scheduled  but for which a specified portion of work has not yet been completed 
we define backlog as the dollar amount of obligations payable to us under negotiated contracts upon completion of a specified portion of work that has not yet been completed  exclusive of revenues previously recognized for work already performed under these contracts  if any 
the approximate value of our backlog was million at december  revenues from product sales currently represent a smaller proportion of our total revenues  and  historically  we have derived most of these revenues from the sales of our sensing systems and products that make use of light transmitting optical fibers  or fiber optics 
although we have been successful in licensing certain technology we do not expect license revenues to represent a significant portion of future revenues  however  over time we do intend to gradually increase such revenues 
in the near term  we expect revenues from product sales to increase 
table of contents primarily in areas associated with our fiber optic instrumentation and test and measurement platforms 
we also expect to increase our investments in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
in the future  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues and that as we develop and commercialize new products  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products 
in july  we established luna technologies  and funded its growth by raising venture capital  which ultimately diluted our equity ownership to as little as approximately during our holding period and to approximately as of september in line with our strategy of building a growing portfolio of businesses and products  we acquired all of the outstanding shares in luna technologies we did not already own in exchange for issuing shares of our common stock in september luna technologies continues to operate as our luna technologies division 
in june  luna technologies entered into a joint cooperation agreement with luna energy  which was formerly an entity in which we held an ownership interest until under this agreement  both parties have agreed to cooperate to develop a fiber optic sensing system product and have agreed to contribute materials  intellectual property  personnel and other resources to the development effort 
upon successful completion of product development  luna energy will receive a license to certain of luna technologies intellectual property and will be required beginning in and continuing through december  to make payments to luna technologies with respect to revenues derived from products sold that utilize this intellectual property 
as of december   luna energy had not yet sold products that would entitle luna technologies to royalty payments under this joint cooperation agreement 
however  at december   luna technologies had received aggregate development milestone payments of  as of that date under this agreement and is entitled to receive additional development milestone payments of up to  in the aggregate  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
luna technologies also has the right to receive royalty payments from sales of products in the future 
the license of certain of the intellectual property from luna technologies to luna energy shall be an exclusive license if luna energy makes certain minimum royalty payments of  in the aggregate between and  and shall be a non exclusive license if luna energy fails to make these minimum royalty payments 
either party has the right to terminate this agreement during the development term upon a provision of advance written notice to the other party 
however  if either party terminates the agreement for convenience or failure to meet certain development milestones  the terminating party may be required to grant license rights to the non terminating party  including  where luna technologies is the terminating party  certain non exclusive and certain exclusive rights with respect to intellectual property of luna technologies was required to complete the development effort  and where luna energy is the terminating party  non exclusive commercialization rights with respect to certain intellectual property of luna energy 
since december  we have not held an ownership interest in luna energy 
in connection with becoming a public company  we have and will continue to incur significant additional expenses such as audit fees  professional fees  increased directors and officers insurance  advisory board and board of directors compensation  and expenses related to hiring additional personnel and expanding our administrative functions 
many of these expenses were not incurred by us prior to our initial public offering 
in addition  upon receiving the net proceeds from our initial public offering  we implemented a strategy for expansion that has significantly increased our operating expenses and will likely continue to result in substantial losses 
we incurred consolidated net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we expand our business  including increased expenses for research and development  sales and marketing  manufacturing  finance and accounting personnel and expenses associated with being a public company 
we may also grow our business in part through acquisitions of additional companies and complementary technologies which could cause us to incur greater than anticipated transaction expenses  amortization or write offs of intangible assets and other acquisition related expenses 
as a result  we expect that we may likely continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses could be substantial 

table of contents in june  luna innovations entered into an ip licensing  development  and supply agreement with intuitive surgical inc under the terms of the multi year agreement  luna will develop and supply its fiber optic based shape sensing and position tracking system for integration into intuitive surgical s products  including the da vinci surgical system 
pursuant to the agreement  intuitive agreed to pay luna certain fees including an up front license fee  development fees payable in quarterly installments over the initial year and a half period following the date of the agreement  and certain other fees  subject to certain termination rights by intuitive and other rights of repayment or reduction 
such fees do not include the minimum purchase requirements of intuitive  which are subject to the successful completion of the development criteria and certain other terms and conditions 
description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues we generate revenues from technology development  product sales and license payments 
we derive technology development revenues from providing research and development services to third parties  including government entities  academic institutions and corporations  and from achieving milestones established by some of these contracts and in collaboration agreements 
in general  we complete contracted research over periods ranging from six months to three years  and recognize these revenues over the life of the contract as costs are incurred or upon the achievement of certain milestones built into the contracts 
our product revenues reflect amounts that we receive from sales of our products or development of products for third parties and currently represent approximately of our total revenues 
our license revenues comprise up front license fees paid to us in connection with licenses or sublicenses of certain patents and other intellectual property as well as royalties  which currently represent an insignificant portion of our license revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues associated with technology development revenues consists of costs associated with performing the related research activities  including direct labor  amounts paid to subcontractors and overhead allocated to technology development activities 
cost of revenues associated with product sales and license revenues consists of license fees for use of certain technologies  product manufacturing costs including all direct material and direct labor costs  amounts paid to our contract manufacturers  manufacturing  shipping and handling  provisions for product warranty  and inventory obsolescence  as well as overhead allocated to these activities 
operating expense operating expense consists of selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as expenses related to research and development  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets 
these expenses also include compensation for employees in executive and operational functions including certain non cash charges related to expenses from option grants  facilities costs  professional fees  salaries  commissions  travel expense and related benefits of personnel engaged in sales  product management and marketing activities  costs of marketing programs and promotional materials  salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel engaged in our own research and development beyond the scope and activities of our technology development group  product development activities not provided under contracts with third parties  and overhead costs related to these activities 
interest income expense interest expense historically related primarily to interest we paid under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding on our credit facility  and we do not expect to draw on that facility in the near term 
in addition  the primary source of our interest expense is accrued interest on our note payable to carilion clinic 

table of contents interest income includes amounts earned on our cash deposits with financial institutions 
we invested the proceeds of the carilion transactions and the net proceeds from its initial public offering in a money market account and draws from that account as needed to fund ongoing operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates technology development revenues we recognize revenue when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on time and materials contracts are recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of deliverables  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the cost of the deliverables compared to the cost of all deliverables included in the contract 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the development and delivery of a specific prototype or product  revenues are recognized on under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectibility of the contract price  we consider our previous experiences with our customers  communications with our customers regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of the normal management processes  facts may change  causing revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the underlying bases for estimating our contract research revenues are measurable expenses such as labor  subcontractor costs and materials  the cost data of which is updated on a regular basis for purposes of preparing our cost estimates 
our research contracts generally have a period of performance of six to months 
accordingly  our estimates of contract costs have historically been consistent with actual results 
revisions in these estimates between accounting periods to reflect changing facts and circumstances have not had a material impact on our operating results  and we do not expect future changes in these estimates to be material 
the allowability of certain costs under government contracts is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 

table of contents product revenues we recognize revenue relating to our products upon shipment 
our products usually include software as a significant and integral component 
after considering the requirements of sop  software revenue recognition  we have concluded that our product sales do not include multiple elements which would require allocating revenue among product and service components  and deferring recognition of revenue relating to the software or other components of our products 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we record on our balance sheet 
management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  management considers factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary difference  taxable income in prior carryback years  whether carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce their net carrying value 
as we assess the sufficiency of future taxable income and other factors noted above in future periods  our estimate of the required valuation allowance may change  which could have a material impact on the accounting period s in which the change occurs 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes interpretation no 

interpretation no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
interpretation no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
interpretation no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we establish a liability at the time we determine it is probable we will be required to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
these liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust such provision  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established liabilities as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
due to differences between federal or state tax law  and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  certain items are included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return 
some differences  such as depreciation expense reverse over time and create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred 
table of contents tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  our financial statements for periods prior to january  were not restated 
however  we incur compensation expense for new awards and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  this compensation expense is computed using the fair value of the stock option as determined by an option pricing model  the black scholes valuation model 
we amortize stock based compensation for such awards on a straight line method over the related service period of the awards taking into account the effects of the employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
to determine the volatility used in this model  we use data from comparable companies  since our stock has only been publicly traded for years 
as we are publicly traded over a longer time period  we will begin to use the volatility of our own stock to compute the compensation expense for options granted 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation cost in our financial statements for all awards granted after january  and for all awards outstanding as of january  for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
as of december   total compensation expense not yet recognized related to unvested options is approximately million after tax 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
r on net income loss and net income loss per share is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock option grants in future years 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we have  in goodwill relating to our acquisition of luna technologies in september  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill and some intangible assets to no longer be amortized 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life and other intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by preparing an undiscounted future net cash flow analysis 
in preparing this projection  we make a number of assumptions  which include  without limitation  future sales volume levels  price levels and rates of increase in operating expenses 
if our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the recorded asset  no impairment is reported 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is recorded 
the amount of the impairment charge is determined by discounting the projected net cash flows 
we amortize our patents over their estimated useful life of five years  and analyze them periodically to determine whether their carrying value has been impaired 
at the end of december  and  respectively  no patents were written down due to any impairment in value 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  revenues  technology development revenues product and license revenues total revenues cost of revenues technology development costs product and license costs total cost of revenues gross profit operating expense operating loss total other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was comprised of a million  or  increase in technology development revenue and a million  or  increase in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue grew due to additional contract awards throughout  resulting in increased billable activities performed 
total product and licensing revenues were million for the year ended december   representing a increase over product and licensing revenues of million for the year ended december  approximately million of the product and license revenues related to product sales of our luna technologies division 
product and license revenues for the year ended december  also included million in sales of medical products and million in contracted product development activities  which included product development work for the arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc and various arrangements with government entities 
contracted product development activities for the year ended december  were cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel during to fulfill our awarded research contracts  a higher proportion of time expended on direct labor  and other direct costs associated with these contracts 

table of contents product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  consistent with the product and license revenue growth of  primarily attributable to increased costs associated with an increase in the number of units sold 
operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating expense was primarily attributable to increased spending in research and development activities  principally related to research concerning carbon nanomaterials and their potential application in diagnostic imaging  development of our medical products  increased recognition of expense for share based compensation  and increases in personnel  professional fees and other costs 
these increased costs were incurred in support of our strategy to achieve long term growth through the commercialization of innovative products utilizing our proprietary and licensed technologies 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase  at a lesser rate of growth  as we continue to invest in new product development and increase product sales 
other income expense other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decline is attributable to reduced cash deposits from to  resulting in lower interest income earned on deposits 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenues of million for the year ended december  the year over year increase was comprised of a million  or  increase in technology development revenue and a million  or  increase in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue grew primarily due to hiring of additional personnel throughout  resulting in increased billable activities performed under our research contracts 
in response to our continued success in being awarded increasing aggregate values of research contracts  we increased the size of our technology development group by full time people during during  product and license revenue grew primarily due to the acquisition of our luna technologies subsidiary and growth in other new product areas such as medical products 
product and license revenues of million in included the full year of our luna technologies subsidiary  acquired in september of the million in product and license revenues  approximately million related to the operations of luna technologies 
product and license revenues of million for include only the revenues earned during the three months following the date of acquisition of luna technologies 
revenues for luna technologies for the nine months ended september  were million 
product and license revenues for also included  in sales of medical products and  in contracted product development activities 
there were no corresponding revenues for medical products and contracted product development activities in cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel during to fulfill our awarded research contracts and other direct costs associated with these contracts 

table of contents product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  consistent with the product and license revenue growth of and primarily attributable to the full year impact in of the acquisition of luna technologies during and the additional costs associated with sales of medical products and contracted product development activities 
operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating expense was primarily attributable to increased spending in research and development activities  principally related to research concerning carbon nanomaterials and their potential application in diagnostic imaging  development of our medical products  additional selling  general and administrative costs associated with our acquisition of luna technologies in september  increased recognition of expense for share based compensation  and increases in personnel  professional fees and other costs associated with our transition to a public company 
these increased costs were incurred in support of our strategy to achieve long term growth through the commercialization of innovative products utilizing our proprietary and licensed technologies 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase  at a lesser rate of growth  as we continue to invest in new product development and increase product sales 
other income expense other income was  for the year ended december  compared to a net expense of less than  for the year ended december  the improvement of  year over year is attributable to interest earned on cash deposits 
we received aggregate proceeds of million from debt and equity financing transactions during the period august through december and net proceeds of approximately million from its initial public offering in june quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited historical revenues  operating income and net loss by quarter during and fiscal year fiscal year dollars in thousands  except loss per share march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  revenues technology development product and license total revenues operating loss net loss basic and fully diluted loss per share liquidity and capital resources prior to august  our primary source of liquidity had been cash provided by operations and divestitures of certain assets and businesses 
in august  we completed our first outside equity financing and raised million through an equity investment by carilion clinic formerly carilion health system 
carilion clinic invested an additional million in december in the form of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes and million in additional equity 

table of contents on june   the effective date of our initial public offering  we sold  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we paid million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred other offering expenses of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund our development of medical products and carbon nanomaterials  and our overall expansion  including facilities  personnel  working capital and other capital expenditures 
we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility with first national bank that is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the interest rate on borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility is equal to the prime rate  limited to no less than and no greater than per annum  and the interest accrued is payable monthly 
under the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility  the outstanding principal is payable in full on demand or at maturity on june  the senior secured revolving credit facility contains covenants which require us to maintain to million in liquidity depending on our outstanding balance 
additionally  without first national bank s prior approval  we may not make a direct loan to an affiliate or subsidiary of ours exceeding  annually  guaranty the debt of our affiliate or subsidiary or incur debt in excess of  non first national bank debt annually 
finally  we are obligated to continue to provide first national bank an assignment of life insurance in a minimum amount of million on the life of kent a 
murphy  covering all of our indebtedness to first national bank 
during  we did not draw any amounts under our secured revolving credit facility  and we do not anticipate a need to draw on that line of credit in the near term given our current cash and cash equivalent balances 
discussion of cash flows recent activity during the year ended december   we used approximately million of net cash from operations 
this was a substantial decrease compared to  when we used million of net cash from operations 
most of this change was due to the decreased net loss year over year  and other working capital component changes 
specifically  the significant working capital component changes between december  and december  were increases in deferred credits relating to advance payments received on certain product development contracts of million  and increase in the amount of share based compensation expense added back to compute net cash used in operating activities of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the purchase of property and equipment and legal fees and costs associated with securing patent rights to certain technology 
our overall cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease was attributable to decreases in spending for both capital assets  which was higher in due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and expansion of certain of our operations  and intellectual property 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  decreased significantly compared to this was due to the absence in of the net proceeds of million from our initial public offering 
as a result of our increased cash position through the initial public offering and our carilion financing transactions  we did not draw additional financing from our line of credit or other sources during at december   total cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
we believe that our current cash on hand and the cash available under our line of credit agreement will be sufficient to fund operations for the next months 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for property and equipment  including both purchased assets and assets acquired under capital leases  as well as capitalized software  totaled million for  a decrease of million from 
table of contents capital expenditures of million in the decrease from to was principally due to expenditures in for build out and furnishing of headquarters and other office space in roanoke and blacksburg locations  which we did not incur in we expect to spend approximately million for capital expenditures in  based on expected normal growth in capacity requirements and routine replacement and upgrades of equipment 
summary of contractual obligations we lease our facilities in blacksburg  charlottesville  danville  hampton  mclean and roanoke  virginia under operating leases that expire between december and january or under a month to month arrangement 
upon expiration of the leases  we may exercise certain renewal options as specified in the leases 
we also lease certain computer equipment and software under a capital lease agreement that expires in february the assets subject to these obligations are included in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet 
in june   our luna technologies division executed a non cancelable  non reschedulable million purchase order for multiple shipments of tunable lasers to be delivered over an month period beginning in july as of december  approximately remained under this commitment 
set forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations as of december  that are fixed and determinable 
except for facility leases and minimum royalty payment obligations  as of december   we did not have contractual obligations that extended beyond may total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital equipment and software lease operating facility leases purchase order obligation deferred credits city of danville grant other liabilities total long term debt obligations consist of senior convertible promissory notes of aggregate principal amount of million and accrued interest thereon held by carilion health system 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia to be used for the expansion of economic and commercial growth within the city 
specifically   of the grant will be used to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and the remaining  is to be used for our creation of new jobs 
the grant stipulates that we must make estimated capital expenditures of at least  and create new full time jobs at our danville facility  at an average wage of at least  plus benefits within months of the award  and then maintain such employment levels for an additional months 
we could be required to repay the grant funds on a pro rata basis should we fail to satisfy the conditions stipulated in the agreement 
as such  since we have not yet met the stipulations of the grant  we have included the  in deferred credits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and other liabilities include remaining amounts payable for the acquisition of our tunable laser product line and minimum royalty payments for licensed technologies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes or have any derivative financial instruments 
our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate fluctuations due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because as of december   our cash reserves were maintained in money market investment accounts and were not exposed to material market risks 
interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations  and  as a result  interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is subject to changes in interest rates 
however  we believe that the impact of these fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position due to the immediate available liquidity or short term nature of these financial instruments 
the interest rate on our line of credit is variable between and based on the current prime rate of interest  however we do not currently have any outstanding balances owed under our line of credit agreement 
as of december   we had million deposited in cash and cash equivalents bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of december   all payments made under our research contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
our product sales to foreign customers are also denominated in us dollars  and we do not receive payments in foreign currency 
as such  we are not directly exposed to currency gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
