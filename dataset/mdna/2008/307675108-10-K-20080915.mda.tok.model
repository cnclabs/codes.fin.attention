item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and with the risk factors described in item a of this report 
critical accounting policies overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  including lifo reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  liabilities relating to retirement benefits  liabilities resulting from self insurance of our workers compensation liabilities  tax liabilities and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from these estimates  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 

table of contents coffee brewing equipment and service the company has reclassified its reporting for expenses related to coffee brewing equipment provided to customers 
these costs include the cost of the equipment as well as the cost of servicing that equipment including service employees salaries and the cost of supplies and parts 
we believe these costs will be better characterized as direct costs of generating revenues from our customers 
accordingly  such costs are now reported as cost of sales in the accompanying financial statements for the years ended june    and  in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
in prior periods  these costs were presented as selling expenses 
this change impacts reported gross profit in the years presented by these amounts 
the change reduces gross profit but has no impact on net income  total assets  or cash flows in any year 
investments our investments consist of investment grade marketable debt instruments issued by the us government and major us and foreign corporations  equity securities  primarily preferred stock  and various derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded treasury futures and options  green coffee forward contracts and commodity purchase agreements 
all derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes where possible 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their obligations 
our ability to maintain a relatively small reserve is directly related to our ability to collect from our customers when our salespeople regularly interact with our customers in person 
this method of operation has provided us with a historically low bad debt experience 
there can be no assurance this will be the case in the future 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and the costs of coffee and allied products are determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
costs of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the first in  first out fifo basis 
we regularly evaluate these inventories to determine whether market conditions are correctly reflected in the recorded carrying value 
self insurance we are self insured for california workers compensation insurance subject to specific retention levels and use historical analysis to determine and record the estimates of expected future expenses resulting from workers compensation claims 
the estimated outstanding losses are the accrual cost of unpaid claims valued as of june  the estimated outstanding losses  including allocated loss adjustment expenses alae  include case reserves  the development on known claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
alae are the direct expenses for settling specific claims 
the amounts reflect the per occurrence and annual aggregate limits maintained by the company 
the analysis does not include estimating a provision for unallocated loss adjustment expense 
management believes that the amount accrued is adequate to cover all known claims at june  if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amount estimated  additional reserves may be required which could have a material negative effect on operating results 
if our estimate were off by as much as  the reserve could be under or overstated by approximately  as of june  
table of contents estimated company liability resulting from our general liability policies  within our deductible limits  is accounted for by specific identification 
large losses have historically been infrequent  and the lag between incurred but not reported claims has historically been short 
once a potential loss has been identified  the case is monitored with our risk manager to try and determine a likely outcome 
lawsuits arising from injury that are expected to reach our deductible are not reserved until we have consulted with legal counsel  become aware of the likely amount of loss and determined when payment is expected 
the estimated liability related to our self insured group medical insurance is recorded on an incurred but not reported basis  within deductible limits  based on actual claims and the average lag time between the date insurance claims are filed and the date those claims are paid 
retirement plans we have two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for the majority of our non union employees 
the balance of our employees are covered by multiemployer union defined benefit plans 
we obtain actuarial valuations for our plans and at present we discount the pension obligations using a discount rate and we estimate an return on plan assets 
the performance of the stock market and other investments as well as the overall health of the economy can have a material effect on pension investment returns and these assumptions 
a change in these assumptions could affect our operating results 
the following chart quantifies the effect on the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost of a change in the discount rate assumption and the impact on the net periodic benefit cost of a change in the assumed long term rate of return for fiscal farmer bros 
plan in thousands discount rate actual net periodic benefit cost projected benefit obligation long term rate of return actual net periodic benefit cost brewmatic plan in thousands discount rate actual net periodic benefit cost projected benefit obligation long term rate of return actual net periodic benefit cost our retiree medical plan is not funded and its liability was calculated using an assumed discount rate of at june  we project an initial medical trend rate of ultimately reducing to in years 
effective january  the company adopted a new plan for retiree medical benefits 
the new plan is a cost sharing approach between the company and covered employees and dependents in which the company subsidizes a larger proportion of covered expenses for retirees who were long term employees  and provides less coverage for retirees who were short term employees 
additionally  the plan establishes a maximum company contribution 

table of contents the effect of adopting this new plan was recorded on the effective date of the plan as an increase in other comprehensive income of  net of related tax effects of  and a reduction to the retiree medical liability of  the other comprehensive income amount is expected to be amortized as a reduction in expense over a period of to years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
estimating our tax liabilities involves judgments related to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we make certain estimates and judgments to determine tax expense for financial statement purposes as we evaluate the effect of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  some of which result from differences in timing of recognition of revenue or expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
changes to these estimates may result in significant changes to our tax provision in future periods 
each fiscal quarter we reevaluate our tax provision and reconsider our estimates and our assumptions related to specific tax assets and liabilities  making adjustments as circumstances change 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r for our stock based compensation 
under sfas r  all stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense in operations over the requisite service period 
the process of estimating the fair value of stock based compensation awards and recognizing stock based compensation cost over the requisite service period involves significant assumptions and judgments 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model which requires that we make certain assumptions regarding i the expected volatility in the market price of our common stock  ii dividend yield  iii risk free interest rates and iv the period of time employees are expected to hold the award prior to exercise referred to as the expected holding period 
in addition  sfas r requires us to estimate the expected impact of forfeited awards and recognize stock based compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates differ materially from our estimates  stock based compensation expense could differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded in the current period 
we will periodically review actual forfeiture experience and revise our estimates  as necessary 
we will recognize the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the revision 
as a result  if we revise our assumptions and estimates  our stock based compensation expense could change materially in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we have been able to maintain a strong working capital position  and believe that our short and long term cash requirements will be provided by internal sources 
we do not expect to rely on banks or other third parties for our working capital needs 
during fiscal the company invested over  to relocate cbi s portland plant to a larger facility to accommodate anticipated growth 
we estimate the total costs associated with this expansion will be approximately million 
the company expects to fund this investment from internal sources 
we have ordered two new roasters and associated production equipment for our torrance facility 
we estimate the costs associated with this upgrade for equipment and installation will be approximately million which we expect to fund from internal sources 

table of contents our working capital is composed of the following june  in thousands current assets current liabilities working capital capital expenditures at june   other than those described above  we had no major commitments for new capital expenditures 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and overview fiscal has been a year for investments in our future 
we have continued to devote substantial resources to our national sales organization 
this type of business requires an extended effort over time  as larger customers contract with their vendors over periods as long as five years 
relationships are important in this type of business and can take years to develop  and we are calling on customers who have relationships with their current vendors 
we are optimistic about the opportunities in this market  and expect to make progress in expanding our national account business in fiscal during fiscal we continued to invest in our plants 
in august cbi moved into its new headquarters and roasting plant in portland  oregon 
we expect this plant to provide additional capacity to accommodate anticipated growth 
through june   we have invested over  in the new cbi plant and equipment 
additionally we have ordered two new roasters and associated production equipment for our torrance facility and expect to have them installed and operating in fiscal our mobile sales software is currently being implemented across our sales network 
we believe approximately of our branches will be live on the new system by november   with the remaining branches converted by the fourth quarter of fiscal operations net sales in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal approximately of this increase resulted from the addition of cbi in fiscal non cbi revenue increased  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal non cbi unit sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of goods sold in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal approximately of this increase resulted from the addition of cbi 
non cbi costs of sales increased  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily the result of higher green coffee costs and increased inventory levels 
our annual lifo adjustment for inventory on hand at the end of fiscal added  to cost of sales 
in a rising market lifo costs represent replacement costs of inventory  not actual cost 
we anticipate that our costs of raw materials and packaging costs will continue to rise in fiscal as a result of higher fuel and energy costs 
additionally  during fiscal the cost of providing coffee brewing equipment and service to our customers increased  or as compared to fiscal costs 
this increase was a result of our sales efforts and is likely to continue if we are successful in adding new national account customers 
gross profit in fiscal increased  or  reflecting  gross profit added by cbi 

table of contents in general  higher commodity prices and higher energy costs  have put pressure on our profit margins in fiscal there are many reasons for the higher costs  including higher demand for oil and a weak dollar 
although we make every effort to pass these higher costs through to our customers  competition restricts our ability to do so 
we cannot predict whether the high rate of product cost inflation will continue in future periods 
operating expenses in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal this increase primarily reflects the addition of cbi in the amount of  including amortization of intangibles connected with the cbi acquisition in the amount of  the non cbi related increase in operating expenses in fiscal was approximately 
for the reasons noted above  loss from operations in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to the significant increase in costs of good sold and our inability to pass those increases on to our customers in the form of higher selling prices 
total other  net expense income total other expense income decreased to a loss of  in fiscal as compared to income of  in fiscal this is primarily the result of a loss in other  net expense income in fiscal of  as compared to income of  in fiscal net realized and unrealized losses from investments  recorded in other  net expense income  in fiscal were  as compared to net realized and unrealized losses in fiscal of  the change in other  net expense income is primarily the result of conditions in the us financial markets 
during fiscal the weakness of the economy and the dramatic decline of the us housing market put pressure on the valuations of the preferred stock we hold 
since approximately of preferred stock issuers are financial institutions  the us sub prime mortgage crisis has hurt the values of our preferred stock portfolio 
selling pressure from leveraged investors who need liquidity and a new supply of preferred issues taking advantage of lower dividend rates have resulted in a downward pressure on values 
even though only of our portfolio is invested in financials  all preferred stocks have been affected 
our holdings include such financial issuers as merrill lynch  lehman brothers and metlife 
the weakness in the financial markets has been dramatic  and at june  we had unrealized losses in preferred stock of  part of our preferred stock investment program includes a hedge against the risk of rising long term interest rates using purchased treasury put options 
this part of the program has also suffered during fiscal as the investor flight to quality has distorted the historical relationship between treasury instruments and preferred stock  leading to hedge losses not offset by portfolio gains 
hedge losses in fiscal were  while the timing of any price recovery of preferred stock to other us fixed income instruments is uncertain  we believe it will eventually occur 
we believe that preferred stocks are currently priced cheaper to us treasury bond yields than they have ever traded 
although aggressive easing of interest rates by the world s central banks and other economic stimulus actions by governments may eventually have positive effects on this situation  we expect little improvement until the housing market stabilizes 
net loss as a result of the above factors  net loss for fiscal was  or per share  as compared to net income of  or per share in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and overview during fiscal our primary focus was to continue our initiatives to strengthen sales 
we provided additional resources and support to our national sales organization 
in addition we completed 
table of contents the roll out of our new product packaging in fiscal  which we believe was well received by our customers 
in fiscal we completed a significant upgrade to our erp system  converted our custom coffee plan division to our erp system and we began testing the mobile sales system 
new branches in shreveport  louisiana and nashville  tennessee were opened in august additionally  as a result of the cbi acquisition  we acquired a coffee plant in portland  oregon 
comparative information net sales in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal  primarily because of increased sales of allied products and an additional  in sales associated with cbi from the date of its acquisition 
non cbi unit sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of goods sold in fiscal increased to  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  in fiscal although margins were fairly stable in fiscal and  the volatility of green coffee prices  higher prices on a variety of raw materials and product packaging  strong competition  increased costs related to coffee brewing equipment and service and the integration of cbi with our existing operations will continue to impact future results 
as a result of these factors  gross profit increased  or  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal total other income expense in fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of higher interest rates during fiscal as a result of the forgoing factors  net income for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal net income per common share was in fiscal as compared to a in fiscal contractual obligations the following table contains supplemental information regarding total contractual obligations as of june  in thousands

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market value risk arising from changes in interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our portfolio of investment grade money market instruments can include at any given time discount commercial paper  medium term notes  federal agency issues and treasury securities 
as of june   over of these funds were invested in us treasury securities with an average maturity of days 
a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately 
table of contents our portfolio of preferred securities includes investments in derivatives that provide a natural economic hedge of interest rate risk 
we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates 
we do not transact in futures contracts or put options for speculative purposes 
the following table demonstrates the impact of varying interest rate changes based on the preferred stock holdings  futures and options positions  and market yield and price relationships at june  this table is predicated on an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates and assumes predictable relationships between the prices of preferred securities holdings  the yields on us treasury securities and related futures and options 
the number and type of futures and options contracts entered into depends on  among other items  the specific maturity and issuer redemption provisions for each preferred stock held  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the expected volatility of us treasury yields  and the costs of using futures and or options 
market value at june  interest rate changes preferred securities futures and options total portfolio changes in market value of total portfolio in thousands basis points basis points unchanged basis points basis points commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee 
the company prices green coffee inventory on the lifo basis 
in the normal course of business we hold a large green coffee inventory and enter into forward commodity purchase agreements with suppliers 
we are subject to price risk resulting from the volatility of green coffee prices 
volatile price increases cannot  because of competition and market conditions  always be passed on to our customers 
from time to time the company will hold a mix of futures contracts and options to help hedge against volatile green coffee price decreases 
gains and losses on these derivative instruments are realized immediately in other  net expense income 
on june  we had no open hedge derivative contracts  and our entire exposure to commodity risk was in the potential change of our inventory value resulting from changes in the market price of green coffee
