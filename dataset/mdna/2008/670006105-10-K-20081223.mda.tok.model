item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through our infrastructure software and ecosystem of business partnerships  we harmoniously integrate mixed it environments  allowing people and technology to work as one 
we deliver an interoperable linux platform and a portfolio of integrated it management software that helps customers worldwide reduce cost  complexity and risk 
with our years of experience and our vision of interoperability and flexibility  we deliver powerful  next generation business infrastructures that are designed to enable our customers to stay competitive 
to best align our business with our strategy  we are organized into four business unit segments 
our business unit segments are open platform solutions  identity and security management  systems and resource management  and workgroup 
below is a revenue update on each of our business unit segments within our open platform solutions business unit segment  linux and open source products remain an important growth area 
during fiscal  we established and expanded relationships with several strategic partners to increase the reach of both our server and desktop products  such as with microsoft and sap 
revenue from our linux platform products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal services revenue also increased  such that total revenue from our open platform solutions business unit segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we continue to expand our position in the identity and security management market by offering products that deliver a complete  integrated solution in the areas of security  compliance  and governance issues 
within this segment  revenue from our identity and access management products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this product revenue increase was offset by services revenue declines of  such that total revenue from our identity and security management business unit segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal systems and resource management products continue to be an important part of our product offering 
our strategy is to provide a complete desktop to data center offering  with leadership in virtualization for both linux and mixed source environments 
systems and resource management product revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  of which of the increase was from the march acquisition of platespin 
the overall product revenue increase was partially offset by services revenue declines of  such that total revenue from our systems and resource management business unit segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our workgroup revenue base is an important source of cash flow and provides us with a potential opportunity to sell additional products and services 
we continued efforts to stabilize the decline of revenue from our legacy products  such as oes and netware related products 
our revenue from workgroup products decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal in addition  services revenue was lower by  such that total revenue from our workgroup business unit segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal given the current economic environment these revenue declines may continue into fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed our acquisitions of platespin and sitescape see the acquisitions section below for more detail 
our services offerings are focused on supporting product sales  not generating stand alone revenue or profits  which is in line with our strategic initiatives 
this includes focusing our services business on driving more profitable product revenue while leveraging our services capabilities internally and through third party partners 
our results for fiscal showed signs of success in this initiative to shift to a more profitable revenue mix  which is reflected in our higher total gross profit and total gross profit margins for fiscal  compared to fiscal though total services revenue was down  total product revenue was up  resulting in a net increase in total net revenue of in fiscal compared to fiscal foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the platespin acquisition each favorably impacted revenue by during fiscal  compared to fiscal during fiscal  we refined the improvements we have made in our sales  product development  and back office initiatives 
in conjunction with these initiatives  we incurred million of net restructuring expenses  which was above our previously announced range of million to million see the restructuring expenses section below for more detail 
while our initiatives and their implementation involve opportunities  risks  and challenges  barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe they position us well in this challenging environment

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued given the current economic environment  we are cautious about our overall outlook for fiscal it market growth rates are expected to slow  sales cycles are likely to extend and budgets for select it investments may be reduced or delayed 
but this uncertainty creates opportunities for us 
for example  as customers seek to leverage and extend their it investments  we believe our open and interoperable linux and data center management solutions address our customer s needs for reducing operating and technology costs within the data center 
additionally  the recent financial turmoil demands stricter requirements for regulation and audit  creating opportunities for certain of our products 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and related reserves  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  loss contingency accruals and share based payments to be critical accounting policies due to the judgments and estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition and related reserves our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software licenses  software maintenance  upgrade protection  subscriptions of suse linux enterprise server  technical support  training  and professional services 
our customers include distributors  who sell our products to resellers  dealers  and vars  oems  who integrate our products with their products or solutions  vars  who provide solutions across multiple vertical market segments which usually include services  and end users  who may purchase our products and services directly from us or from other partners or resellers 
except for our suse linux product  distributors do not order to stock and only order products when they have an end customer order 
with respect to our suse linux product  distributors place orders and the product is then sold to end customers principally through the retail channel 
oems report the number of copies duplicated and sold via an activity or royalty report 
software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles typically involve one to three year contract terms 
our standard practice is to provide customers with a day general right of return 
such return provision allows for a refund and or credit of any amount paid by our customers 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
when an arrangement does not require significant production  modification  or customization of software or does not contain services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered typically in the form of a signed contract or statement of work accompanied by a purchase order 
delivery has occurred for software licenses  delivery takes place when the customer is given access to the software programs via access to a website or shipped medium 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to cancellation or other payment terms that exceed our standard payment terms 
typical payment terms are net days 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is creditworthy and collection is probable 
prior credit history with us  credit reports  financial statements  and bank references are used to assess creditworthiness 

table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued in general  revenue for transactions that do not involve software customization or services considered essential to the functionality of the software is recognized as follows software license fees for our suse linux product are recognized when the product is sold to an end customer  software license fees for sales through oems are recognized upon receipt of license activity or royalty reports  all other software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software  software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles are recognized ratably over the contract term  and professional services  training and other similar services are recognized as the services are performed 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors  such as bankruptcy 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect future returns or bad debts  adjustments to these reserves may be required that would increase or decrease revenue or net income 
many of our software arrangements include multiple elements 
such elements typically include any or all of the following software licenses  rights to additional software products  software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  training and professional services 
for multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software and do not involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we allocate value to each element based on its relative fair value  if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
novell specific objective evidence of fair value is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but does not exist for the delivered element  typically the software  then the residual method is used to allocate value to each element 
under the residual method  each undelivered element is allocated value based on novell specific objective evidence of fair value for that element  as described above  and the remainder of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element  typically the software 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements and the arrangement involves rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
if the arrangement does not involve rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is initially deferred until typically the only remaining undelivered element is software maintenance or technical support  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support term 
in the case of multiple element arrangements that involve significant modification or customization of the software or involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting is applied 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for software maintenance or technical support in arrangements requiring contract accounting  the professional services and license fees are combined and revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is generally calculated using hours incurred to date relative to the total expected hours for the entire project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
the maintenance or support fee is unbundled from the other elements and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance or support term 
when novell specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for software maintenance or support  then all revenue is deferred until completion of the professional services  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support period 
for consolidated statements of operations classification purposes only  we allocate the revenue first to those elements for which we have novell specific objective evidence of fair value  and any remaining recognized revenue is then allocated to those items for which we lack novell specific objective evidence of fair value

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued professional services contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized based on the proportional performance method  generally using estimated time to complete to measure the completed effort 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
professional services revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients 
microsoft agreements related revenue 
on november   we entered into the microsoft agreements 
each of the agreements is scheduled to expire on january  under the business collaboration agreement  we are marketing a combined offering with microsoft 
the combined offering consists of sles and a subscription for sles support along with microsoft windows server  microsoft virtual server and microsoft viridian  and is offered to customers desiring to deploy linux and windows in a virtualized setting 
microsoft made an upfront payment to us of million for sles subscription certificates  which microsoft may use  resell or otherwise distribute over the term of the agreement  allowing the certificate holder to redeem single or multi year subscriptions for sles support from us entitling the certificate holder to upgrades  updates and technical support 
microsoft agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for marketing linux and windows virtualization scenarios and also agreed to spend million over the term of the agreement for a microsoft sales force devoted primarily to marketing the combined offering 
microsoft agreed that for three years following the initial date of the agreement it will not enter into an agreement with any other linux distributor to encourage adoption of other company s linux windows server virtualization through a program substantially similar to the sles subscription certificate distribution program 
the technical collaboration agreement focuses primarily on four areas development of technologies to optimize sles and windows  each running as guests in a virtualized setting on the other operating system  development of management tools for managing heterogeneous virtualization environments  to enable each party s management tools to command  control and configure the other party s operating system in a virtual machine environment  development of translators to improve interoperability between microsoft office and openoffice 
org document formats  and collaboration on improving directory and identity interoperability and identity management between microsoft active directory software and novell edirectory software 
under the technical collaboration agreement  microsoft agreed to provide funding to help accomplish these broad objectives  subject to certain limitations 
under the patent cooperation agreement  microsoft agreed to covenant with our customers not to assert its patents against our customers for their use of our products and services for which we receive revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions  while we agreed to covenant with microsoft s customers not to assert our patents against microsoft s customers for their use of microsoft products and services for which microsoft receives revenue directly or indirectly  with certain exceptions 
in addition  we and microsoft each irrevocably released the other party  and its customers  from any liability for patent infringement arising prior to november   with certain exceptions 
both we and microsoft have payment obligations under the patent cooperation agreement 
microsoft made an upfront net balancing payment to us of million  and we are making ongoing payments to microsoft totaling a minimum of million over the five year term of the agreement based on a percentage of our open platform solutions and open enterprise server revenues 
as the three agreements are interrelated and were negotiated and executed simultaneously  for accounting purposes we considered all of the agreements to constitute one arrangement containing multiple elements 
the sles subscription purchases of million were within the scope of sop  and are being accounted for based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
we recognize the revenue ratably over the respective subscription terms beginning upon customer activation  or for subscriptions which expire un activated  if any  we will recognize revenue upon subscription expiration

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued patent cooperation agreement and technical collaboration agreement did not exist 
as such  we combined the million for the patent cooperation agreement payment and amounts we are receiving under the technical collaboration agreement and are recognizing this revenue ratably over the contractual term of the agreements of five years 
our periodic payments to microsoft will be recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the contractual expenditures by microsoft  including the dedicated sales force of million and the marketing funds of million  do not obligate us to perform  and  therefore  do not have an accounting consequence to us 
long lived assets our long lived assets include net fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
at october   our long lived assets included million of goodwill  million of net property  plant and equipment  million of identifiable intangible assets  and million of long term investments 
we periodically review our net property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could indicate impairment include significant underperformance of the asset as compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the actual or intended use of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  which we estimate based on discounted expected future cash flows 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of august  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant  such as a material adverse change in the business 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value 
fair values are estimated using the combination of a discounted cash flow methodology and a market analysis and averaging the results 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes in reporting units and changes to the estimates used in the analyses  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the reporting units or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
future analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to million  the full amount of our goodwill  depending on the estimated value of the reporting units and the value of the net assets attributable to those reporting units at that time 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal   and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment reviews and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
these assessments are made at the reporting unit level  which are our four business unit segments  and therefore we could be subject to an impairment charge to goodwill if any one of our reporting units does not perform in line with forecasts in the future 
in addition  changes in the assumptions used in the analyses could have changed the resulting outcomes 
for example  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units at august   we made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on our fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
developed technology is generally amortized over three years as a cost of revenue 
customer relationships are amortized over one to three years as a sales expense 
most of our trademarks trade names have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for developed technology intangible assets that we acquired but later determined that we would not utilize as initially planned 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the e security acquisition 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the ximian acquisition

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued deferred tax assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future income 
based on all the available evidence  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that most of our net deferred tax assets  and certain foreign deferred tax assets  are not currently realizable 
in reaching this determination  we evaluated our three year cumulative results  our pre tax losses for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as well as the impacts that current economic conditions may have on our future results 
as a result  we continue to provide a valuation reserve on our us net deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
it is reasonably possible that we could reduce a significant portion of our valuation allowance in the near term 
valuation of investments that do not have active markets at october  and october   we held eight arss that are classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual maturities for these arss are years or greater with an interest rate reset date approximately every days 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the carrying value of our arss approximated fair value 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our arss have experienced multiple failed auctions and the estimated market value of these securities is less than cost 
we estimated the fair value of these arss using a discounted cash flow analysis that considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security  ii the present value of the future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security  and iii consideration of the time horizon that the market value of each security could return to its cost 
we estimated that the fair market value of these securities at october  and october  was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million based on our assessment that it is likely that the fair value of the arss will not fully recover in the foreseeable future  given a combination of factors  including the duration  severity and continued declining trend of the fair value of these securities as well as a deterioration in some of the securities credit ratings 
in connection with the other than temporary impairment charge  we reversed all of the million of temporary impairment charges pertaining to these securities that were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income line item in our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal prior to the impairment charges  the original cost of these arss was million 
the fair value of the arss could further change significantly in the future and we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods 
loss contingency accruals and restructurings we are required to make accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation 
we accrue these items in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 which requires us to accrue for losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated  however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require us to make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information 
during fiscal and  we recorded a million and million adjustment  respectively  to increase accruals related to loss contingencies due to changes in facts and circumstances  respectively 
prior to fiscal  we evaluated our tax reserves under sfas no 
 which required us to accrue for losses we believed were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under fin  a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax 
table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued laws 
the adoption of fin resulted in a million non cash adjustment to increase our reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction to beginning retained earnings 
our policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures was not impacted as a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin interest and penalties on tax reserves continue to be classified as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
when our restructurings include leased facilities  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we are required to make assumptions about future sublease income  which would offset our costs and decrease our accrual 
during fiscal and  we recorded net increases of million and million  respectively  to increase accruals related to facility reserves due to changes in facts and circumstances 
share based payments under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes model to value both service condition and performance condition option awards under sfas no 
r 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance or market conditions granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the graded vesting method 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of our common stock 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and our historical exercise  cancellation and expiration patterns 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures when recognizing stock based compensation expense based on historical rates and forward looking factors 
we update these assumptions at least on an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted 
we issue performance based equity awards  typically to senior executives  which vest upon the achievement of certain financial performance goals  including revenue and income targets 
determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of the stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future financial results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change 
if the financial performance goals are not met  the award does not vest  so no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized stock based compensation expense is reversed 
in the past  we issued market condition equity awards  typically to senior executives  the vesting of which is accelerated or contingent upon the price of our common stock meeting specified pre established stock price targets 
for awards granted prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the fair value of each market condition award was estimated as of the grant date using the same option valuation model used for time based options without regard to the market condition criteria 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r  compensation cost is recognized over the estimated requisite service period and is not reversed if the market condition target is not met 
if the pre established stock price targets are achieved  any remaining expense on the date the target is achieved is recognized either immediately or  in situations where there is a remaining minimum time vesting period  ratably over that period

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   but we adopted it early in fiscal traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements 
table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued staff accounting bulleting no 
continued on the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
prior to our application of the guidance in sab  we consistently applied the roll over method when quantifying financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of misstatements on each of the financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permits us to initially apply its provisions to errors that are material under the dual method but were not previously material under our previously used method of assessing materiality either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been applied or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of the applicable balance sheet accounts as of november  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we elected to record the effects of applying sab using the cumulative effect transition method and adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for misstatements associated with our historical stock based compensation expense and related income tax effects as described below 
we do not consider any of the misstatements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in any of the prior years affected under our previous method for quantifying misstatements  the roll over method 
historical stock based compensation practices on may   we announced that we had completed our self initiated  voluntary review of our historical stock based compensation practices and determined the related accounting impact 
the review was conducted under the direction of the audit committee of our board of directors  who engaged the law firm of cahill gordon reindel llp  with whom we had no previous relationship  as independent outside legal counsel to assist in conducting the review 
the scope of the review covered approximately grant actions on approximately grant dates from november  through september  within these pools of grants are more than  individual grants 
in total  the review encompassed awards relating to more than million shares of common stock granted over the ten year period 
the audit committee  together with its independent outside legal counsel  did not find any evidence of intentional wrongdoing by any of our former or current employees  officers or directors 
we have determined  however  that we utilized incorrect measurement dates for some of the stock based compensation awards granted during the review period 
the incorrect measurement dates can be attributed primarily to the following reasons administrative corrections in the period from fiscal to  we corrected administrative errors identified subsequent to the original authorization by awarding stock options that we dated with the original authorization date 
the administrative errors included incorrect lists of optionees  generally new hires who were inadvertently omitted from the lists of optionees because of the delayed updating of our personnel list  and miscalculations of the number of options to be granted to particular employees on approved lists 
number of shares approved not specified documented authorization for certain grants  primarily in the period from fiscal through  lacked specificity for some portion or all of the grant 
authorization incomplete or received late for certain grants  primarily in the period from fiscal through  there is incomplete documentation to determine with certainty when the grants were actually authorized or the authorization was received after the stated grant date 
in light of the above findings  we and our advisors performed an exhaustive process to uncover all information that could be used in making a judgment as to appropriate measurement dates 
we used all available information to form conclusions as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred and to form conclusions as to the appropriate measurement dates 
under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
because the exercise prices of the stock options on the new measurement dates were  in some instances  lower than the fair market value of the underlying stock on such dates  we were required to record stock based compensation expense for these differences 
as a result  stock based compensation expense in a

continued cumulative after tax amount of approximately million should have been reported in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years through after considering the materiality of the amounts of stock based compensation and related income tax effects that should have been recognized in each of the applicable historic periods  including the interim periods of fiscal and  we determined that the errors were not material to any prior period  on either a quantitative or qualitative basis  under our previous method for quantifying misstatements  the roll over method 
therefore  we have not restated our consolidated financial statements for prior periods

because much of the revenue we invoice is deferred and recognized over time  we consider invoicing  or bookings  to be a key indicator of current sales force performance and future revenue performance

in addition  the windfall tax benefits associated with stock based compensation will be credited to additional paid in capital 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no

accordingly  during fiscal a tax benefit of million was credited to additional paid in capital reflecting a million tax benefit relating to stock options for current year exercises and utilization of previously reserved net operating losses and tax credits  partially offset by a million adjustment for prior year tax filings

the benefit of the use of these loss carryforwards will be recorded to first reduce goodwill relating to the acquisition  second to reduce other non current intangible assets relating to the acquisition  and third to reduce income tax expense 
in addition  we have approximately million of foreign loss carryforwards  of which million  million  and million are subject to expiration in years   and  respectively 
the remaining losses do not expire 
we have million in capital loss carryforwards  which  if not utilized  will expire in fiscal years through we have foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that expire between fiscal years and  general business credit carryforwards of million that expire between fiscal years and  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million that do not expire 
we also have various state net operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire in accordance with the respective state statutes 
as of october   deferred tax assets of approximately million pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
if realized  the tax benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity 
additionally  deferred tax assets of million relate to acquired entities 
these acquired deferred tax assets are subject to limitation under the change of ownership rules of the internal revenue code and have a full valuation allowance 
approximately million of future tax benefit relating to these deferred tax assets will be recorded to first reduce goodwill relating to the acquisition  second to reduce other non current intangible assets relating to the acquisition  and third to reduce income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effects of foreign taxes  stock based compensation plans  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain income items on which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
the effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal was compared to an effective tax rate of for the same period in fiscal included in the fiscal effective tax rate are million in adjustments related to settlements of prior period audits and tax filings 
the effective tax rate for fiscal differs from the effective tax rate for fiscal because  even though we had losses from continuing operations in fiscal  we had income tax expense resulting primarily from the use of previously reserved us net operating loss carryovers 
in accordance with determinations made pursuant to the applicable accounting standards  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that most of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available evidence 
as a result  we have provided a valuation allowance on those us net deferred tax assets 
in reaching this determination  we evaluated our three year cumulative results  our pre tax losses for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as well as the impacts that current economic conditions may have on our future results 
as deferred tax assets or liabilities increase or decrease in the future  or if a portion or all of the valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  the adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease future income tax provisions  goodwill or additional paid in capital 
it is reasonably possible that we could reduce a significant portion of our valuation allowance in the near term 
the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased by million in fiscal primarily due to stock based compensation and other originating assets  new acquisitions  and changes in our deferred tax liabilities 
during the fiscal year  we reduced our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance by million for certain operating losses and credits that are not valid in the future as a result of tax law limitations 
we have not provided deferred taxes relative to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such undistributed earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
prior to this fiscal year  we had provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  but such deferred taxes were reversed during the current fiscal year based on our assertion to remain indefinitely reinvested in all foreign subsidiaries 
we consider the earnings to be indefinitely reinvested based on management s overall business strategy  including anticipated future uses of global cash balances 
we will calculate any potential future tax liabilities relating to these undistributed foreign earnings if we no longer meet the criteria to remain indefinitely reinvested 
total undistributed earnings of approximately million at october  may become taxable upon their remittance as dividends or upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to determine the amounts of net additional income tax that may be payable if such earnings were repatriated

 accounting for income taxes 
under fin  a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
the adoption of fin resulted in a million non cash adjustment to increase our reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction to beginning retained earnings 
our policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures was not impacted as a result of the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin interest and penalties on tax reserves continue to be classified as income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations

as of october   we had reserves for unrecognized tax benefits totaling million  of which million would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized 
the million decrease in reserves for unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year relates primarily to benefits recognized as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations  settlements with tax authorities  and changes to measurement of existing uncertain tax positions for changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by increases for unrecognized tax benefits originating during the year 
during fiscal  we accrued approximately million in interest related to unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by a million reduction in accrued interest attributable to the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in which the statute of limitations lapsed during the year 
we had approximately million and million accrued for the payment of interest related to unrecognized to benefits as of november  and october   respectively 
we have recorded a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest in the line item  other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest has been recorded in the line item  income taxes payable  in the consolidated balance sheet 
the difference between the total unrecognized tax benefits and those affecting the effective tax rate is due to certain unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our deferred taxes if recognized 
as of october   we believe it is reasonably possible that million of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next months as the result of statute of limitations expiring in various jurisdictions 
we do not believe that the favorable million decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would significantly impact the effective tax rate in any one period

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal continued interest expense and other  net for fiscal increased compared to fiscal due primarily to additional interest expense on our debentures 
due to the voluntary review of our historical stock based compensation practices that was announced in august and not completed until may  we did not file our third quarter fiscal form q  fiscal form k  and first quarter fiscal form q in a timely manner 
in september  we received a letter from wells fargo bank  na  the trustee of our debentures  which asserted that we were in default under the indenture because of the delay in filing our form q for the period ended july  the letter stated that the asserted default would not become an event of default under the indenture if we cured the default within days after the date of the notice 
we believe that this above mentioned notice of default was invalid and without merit because the indenture only requires us to provide the trustee copies of sec reports within days after such filings are actually made 
however  in order to avoid the expense and uncertainties of further disputing whether a default under the indenture had occurred  we solicited consents from the holders of the debentures to proposed amendments to the indenture that would give us until thursday  may  to become current in our sec reporting obligations and a waiver of rights to pursue remedies available under the indenture with respect to any default caused by our not filing sec reports timely 
on november   we received consents from the holders of the debentures  and therefore we and the trustee entered into a first supplemental indenture implementing the proposed amendments described in the consent solicitation statements 
under the terms of the consent solicitation and first supplemental indenture  we paid an additional per annum  or million  in special interest on the debentures from november  to  but excluding november  in accordance with eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf  since the change in the terms of the debentures did not result in substantially different cash flows  this change in terms is accounted for as a modification of debt and not an extinguishment of debt  and therefore the additional million of special interest payments is expensed over the period from november  through july   the date the debentures are first callable by either party 
during the period of november  through july   the new effective interest rate on this debt  including the million  is 
the million of special interest payments were paid over three periods 
payments of million  million and million occurred in january  july  and january  respectively 
in addition  we expensed approximately million in fees paid to citigroup for work performed on the consent process

income tax expense on income from continuing operations fiscal year ended october  change dollars in thousands income tax expense effective tax rate we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the use of estimates is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in addition to the income taxes provided for continuing operations noted above  we received an income tax benefit from discontinued operations of less than million in fiscal and provided for an income tax expense from discontinued operations of million in fiscal due to the utilization of a significant amount of our net operating loss carryforwards in prior years  substantially all of the tax benefit received from the use of our remaining net operating loss carryforwards to offset us taxable income in fiscal and fiscal was credited to additional paid in capital or goodwill and not to income tax expense

in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which responded to diversity in practice of how sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was being implemented 
specifically  fin recognized that  when uncertainty about the timing and or settlement method existed  some entities were recognizing the fair value of asset retirement obligations aros prior to retirement of the asset  while others were recognizing the fair value of the obligation only when it was probable that the asset would be retired on a specific date or when the asset was actually retired 
fin clarified that the uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement when settlement is conditional on a future event occurring should be reflected in the measurement of the liability  not in the recognition of the liability 
aros must be recognized even though uncertainty may exist about the timing or method of settlement and therefore a liability should be recognized when the aro is incurred 
we adopted fin effective may  fin requires an entity to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying fin as a change in accounting principle 
prior to the issuance of fin  we accounted for aros when it became probable that the asset would be retired or when the asset was actually retired

we monitor our investments and record losses when a decline in the investment s market value is determined to be other than temporary 
at october  and october   we held eight arss that are classified as long term investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
contractual maturities for these arss are years or greater with an interest rate reset date approximately every days 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the carrying value of our arss approximated fair value 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our arss have experienced multiple failed auctions and the estimated market value of these securities at october  was million 

table of contents novell  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued we estimated the fair value of these arss using a discounted cash flow analysis that considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure of each security  ii the present value of the future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security  and iii consideration of the time horizon that the market value of each security could return to its cost 
we estimated that the fair market value of these securities at october  and october  was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million based on our assessment that it is likely that the fair value of the arss will not fully recover in the foreseeable future  given a combination of factors  including the duration  severity and continued declining trend of the fair value of these securities as well as a deterioration in some of the securities credit ratings 
in connection with the other than temporary impairment charge  we reversed all of the million of temporary impairment charges pertaining to these securities that were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income line item in our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal prior to the impairment charges  the original cost of these arss was million 
the fair value of the arss could further change significantly in the future and we may be required to record additional other than temporary impairment charges if there are further reductions in fair value in future periods 
during fiscal  our holdings in an enhanced liquidity fund were frozen due to liquidity issues 
we believe  barring unforeseen circumstances  that the underlying securities are not impaired if held to maturity 
as the underlying securities mature  the fund manager is distributing the cash on a pro rata basis to the fund s shareholders 
during fiscal  we received million in fund distributions 
as of october   the balance of this investment is million 
we anticipate that million of this balance will be distributed during the next twelve months 
the remaining million is anticipated to be distributed more than one year after october   and is classified as a long term investment on our consolidated balance sheet 
at present  the fund s cash is being distributed faster than originally scheduled 
the fund continues to accrue and pay interest income and  as there are no other than temporary impairment or valuation issues with these securities  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with this investment 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in the enhanced liquidity fund and our arss will affect our ability to operate our business in the usual course in the next twelve months

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
previously  accounting rules required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that created artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  our fiscal  though early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard is optional 
since we do not currently have complex hedge accounting requirements  there is little incentive to elect the fair value option on any of our applicable financial assets or liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
with what we believe to be the conservative nature of our investments and our strong cash and short term investment position  we believe that we are in a good position to weather the current economic conditions  barring unforeseen circumstances 
market risk we have experienced market risk and liquidity issues related to our investment funds 
see the liquidity and capital resources section in management s discussion and analysis for more detail on these investments 
we hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan 
as of october   the gross unrealized loss before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in an approximately million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
as a result of the failure of the auctions for our arss  and the ensuing duration  severity and continued decline of the fair value of these securities  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our arss in fiscal we estimate that these securities have a fair value of million at october  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future 
table of contents novell  inc 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued auctions and their credit ratings significantly deteriorate  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of these investments and recognize additional other than temporary declines in fair value 
prior to the impairment charges  the original cost of these arss was million 
we also hold million of lehman brothers corporate notes 
as a result of lehman brothers bankruptcy announcement  a million other than temporary charge was recorded in fiscal related to this security 
we continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business in the usual course in the next twelve months 
foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  impact our consolidated statements of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts should generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
if the us dollar were to strengthen  it is anticipated that the impact to revenue would be approximately to  and we would anticipate a comparable movement in the opposite direction for expenses 
this assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time and the ratio of non us dollar denominated revenue and expenses to us dollar denominated revenue and expenses does not change from current levels 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to revenues or expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  compared to fiscal  favorably impacted revenue by million  unfavorably impacted operating expenses by million and unfavorably impacted income loss from operations by million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
