item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a global leader in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants  including joint and dental  spinal implants  trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products sometimes referred to in this report as osp 
we also provide other healthcare related services 
reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees  hips  shoulders and elbows 
dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease 
spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases  deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine 
trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body s natural healing process 
osp include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation 
we have operations in more than countries and market products in more than countries 
we manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the americas  europe and asia pacific 
certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 
certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
we believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  demand volume and mix trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed percentage points of sales growth  which is percentage points above the rate of growth from compared to we believe orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis will continue to rise at mid single digit rates driven by an aging global population  obesity and more active lifestyles  among other factors 
in addition  the continued shift in demand to premium products  such as longevity  durasul and prolong highly crosslinked polyethylenes  trabecular metal technology products  high flex knees  knee revision products and porous hip stems  continue to positively affect sales growth 
for example  during  sales of products incorporating trabecular metal technology were over million  a year over year increase of over percent 
we believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry 
in  we acquired orthosoft inc  a market leader in surgical navigation in orthopaedics 
combined with our smarttools strategic initiative  we are focused on becoming a leader in operating room efficiency and enhancing surgical outcomes through the use of innovative navigation devices and cutting tools 
we continued our significant progress in the development and introduction of mis implants  procedures and technologies 
during the year ended december   the zimmer institute trained nearly  surgeons on advanced techniques  including approximately surgeons on mis procedures 
we believe innovative products will continue to affect the orthopaedics industry 
in the second half of  we launched the zimmer gender solutions high flex knee femoral implant 
high flex knees now make up approximately percent of our total femoral unit sales on a global basis  having grown from approximately percent prior to the launch of the zimmer gender solutions knee 
pricing trends selling prices were flat during compared to a modest increase during when compared to asia pacific selling prices decreased percentage point for the year ended december   compared to a percent decrease in when compared to as anticipated  the japanese government reduced reimbursement rates during this action affected sales in japan negatively by approximately percent for  while other asia pacific markets were flat to positive 
japan represents approximately percent of our sales 
the americas experienced a percent increase in selling prices during  compared to a percent increase in in europe  selling prices for decreased percent  the same decrease we saw in as compared to within europe  germany and italy reported decreases in average selling prices of percent and percent  respectively  in  as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates and group purchasing arrangements while most other european markets were positive to flat 
germany and italy combined represent approximately percent of our sales 
with the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing organizations  global selling prices are expected to remain flat in foreign currency exchange rates for  foreign currency exchange rates had a positive percent effect on global sales growth 
if foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates  we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in of approximately percent on sales 
we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities  and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization  through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk 
changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth  but due to offsetting gains losses on hedge contracts  which are

in november  we acquired orthosoft inc  a leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery  in a cash transaction for an aggregate value of approximately million 
settlement of department of justice investigation on september   we and other major us orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with the united states government to resolve all claims related to an ongoing investigation into financial relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey 
under the provisions of the deferred prosecution agreement  we are subject to oversight by a federal monitor selected by the us attorney for a period of months 
we expect to continue to incur costs of approximately million per quarter  to comply with the deferred prosecution agreement through the remainder of the month period 
we settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the united states government of million 
we recorded a million expense during the third quarter in connection with the settlement 
we also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general of the us department of health and human services  which has a term of years 
for more information regarding the settlement  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
prior to the adoption of fin  we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal  state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impacts of these expected settlements of million  as well as a separate accrued interest liability of million 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we are required to present the different components of such liability gross versus the historical net presentation 
the adoption resulted in the tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by million as of january  this decrease in the tax liability resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of million  a reduction in goodwill of million  the establishment of a tax receivable of million  and the addition of an interest penalty payable of million  all as of january  outlook our operating profit for will be affected by the costs we will incur to implement a number of recently announced initiatives that we believe will position us to respond better to the changing needs of the healthcare market 
additionally  during we expect to incur costs of approximately million per quarter to comply with the deferred prosecution the dynesys dynamic stabilization spinal system is indicated for use as an adjunct to fusion in the us palacos is a trademark of heraeus kulzer gmbh manufactured by kensey nash corporation

significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
excess inventory and instruments we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost 
similarly  we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply 
reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components 
the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory  which is recorded at cost 
obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
income taxes we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established equate to less than percent of total liabilities and represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets 
as such  these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets 
share based payment we account for share based payment expense in accordance with the fair value 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
form k annual report recognition provisions of sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
additionally  we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options 
the expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors 
the assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management s best estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in euros  swiss francs  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars and korean won 
we manage the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings 
for contracts outstanding at december   we had obligations to purchase us dollars and sell euros  japanese yen  british pounds  canadian dollars  australian dollars and korean won or purchase swiss francs and sell us dollars at set maturity dates ranging from january through may the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase us dollars at december  and  were  million and  million  respectively 
the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase swiss francs at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average contract rates outstanding are euro usd  usd swiss franc  usd japanese yen  british pound usd  usd canadian dollar  australian dollar usd and usd korean won we maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities 
our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of our risk management program  we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and korean won  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million  million  million  million  million  million and million for the euro  swiss franc  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and korean won contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately  million at december   primarily in swiss francs  japanese yen and euros 
approximately  million of the net asset exposure at december  relates to goodwill recorded in the europe and asia pacific geographic segments 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
as a result  foreign currency translation gains losses recognized in earnings under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation are generally offset with gain losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period 
commodity price risk we purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  polymer and sterile packaging 
we enter into supply contracts generally with terms of to months  where available  on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of our risk management program  we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

form k annual report interest rate risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities 
presently  we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in us government treasury funds and bank deposits 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities 
we are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed senior credit facility and our uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount outstanding remains constant  would not have a material effect on interest expense 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
we place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
we believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments 
we are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation 
we also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
we manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines 
we do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
