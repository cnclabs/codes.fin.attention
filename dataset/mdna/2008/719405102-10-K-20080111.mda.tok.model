item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended october   october  and october  overview the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers  and manufacturers of fpds 
photomask technology is also being applied to the fabrication of other higher performance electronic products such as photonics  micro electronic mechanical systems and certain nanotechnology applications 
thus  the company s selling cycle is tightly interwoven with the development and release of new semiconductor designs and flat panel applications  particularly as it relates to the semiconductor industry s migration to more advanced design methodologies and fabrication processes 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on design activity rather than sales volumes from products produced using photomask technologies 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor or fpd sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized ics  reductions in design complexity or other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or fpd designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors and fpds increases 
advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the global semiconductor industry is driven by end markets which have been closely tied to consumer driven applications for high performance semiconductor devices including  but not limited to communications and mobile computing solutions 
the company cannot predict the timing of the industry s transition to volume production of next generation technology nodes or the timing of up and down cycles with precise accuracy  but believes that such transitions and cycles will continue into the future  beneficially and adversely affecting its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the company s ability to remain successful in these environments is based upon achieving its goals of being a service and technology leader  an efficient solutions supplier  and a company able to continually reinvest in its global infrastructure 
as of december  state of the art production for semiconductor masks is considered to be nanometer for ics  and generation to generation process technologies for fpds  while nanometer has moved into volume production 
and above nanometer and generation through generation process technologies for fpds constitute the majority of high performance designs being fabricated in volume today 
the company expects there to be an increase in nanometer designs moving to wafer fabrication throughout fiscal and believes it is well positioned to service an increasing volume of this business through investments in manufacturing processes and technology in the global regions where its customers are located 
in and  the company experienced growth in demand for fpd photomasks  which it currently supplies from its facilities in korea and taiwan 
in december  the company completed construction of its manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  which began production in the second quarter of the company s fiscal year 
the photomask industry has been  and is expected to continue to be  characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture even more complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific ics 
through fiscal  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
through fiscal  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring ic designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to  or utilize these or other changing technologies  due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices asp 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s cash payments for capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high end technology products aggregated approximately million for the three fiscal years ended october   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
in  the company invested million in the mp mask joint venture  and technology license and related agreements  and will continue to invest in advanced technologies 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating ics and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been  and continues to be  capital intensive due to the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consist of ten current manufacturing sites  plus commencement of a capital lease agreement in the first quarter of fiscal for the us nanofab  which is scheduled to begin production during the first quarter of calendar  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess or underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins  or result in write offs from asset impairments 
the vast majority of photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger for ics  and generation technologies or lower for fpds 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
semiconductor fabrication also occurs below nanometer for ics  and generation and above for fpds 
the company is currently capable of producing a selective range of photomasks at these smaller geometries  and has begun accelerating its efforts to support the development and production of photomasks for  and nanometer technology nodes in semiconductors and generation in fpd 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its four advanced technology locations worldwide  and at its us nanofab 
on may   photronics and micron entered into the mp mask joint venture  which develops and produces photomasks for leading edge and advanced next generation semiconductors 
as part of the formation of the joint venture  micron contributed its existing photomask technology center located at its boise  idaho  headquarters to mp mask and photronics has paid micron million through october   and a final payment of million is due to micron on may   in exchange for a interest in mp mask and a license for photomask technology of micron and certain supply agreements 
in  the company invested an additional million in mp mask for capital expenditure and working capital purposes 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a capital lease agreement commenced with micron for the us nanofab for a total cost of million total payments under the capital lease are million of which million represents interest 
photronics total investment in the purchase and equipping of its us nanofab is expected to fall within a range of million to million and may include the redeployment of some existing photronics assets 
the us nanofab is expected to begin production during the first quarter of calendar in march of  the company further streamlined its operating infrastructure in north america by closing the austin  texas manufacturing and research and development center and relocating certain development and manufacturing work to other facilities within the global network 
the company incurred total restructuring charges of million in its fiscal year ended october  in january  the company sold its austin  texas manufacturing and research and development facility for proceeds of million and realized a gain of million 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  october  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges gain on sale of facility operating income interest expense investment and other income  net income before income tax benefit provision and minority interest income tax benefit provision minority interest net income note all the following tabular comparisons  unless otherwise indicated  are for the fiscal years ended october   october  and october   in millions of dollars 
net sales percent change to to fpd ic total net sales net sales for decreased to million as compared to million for the decrease is related to reducedsales of fpd photomasks of million associated with decreased asps primarily for high end fpd photomasks  and reduced sales of ic photomasks of million as a result of a decline in asps  primarily from mainstream products 
high end photomask applications  which typically have higher asps  include mask sets for fpd products using g and above technologies and ic products using nanometer and below technologies 
during  sales of high end photomasks totaled million as compared to million in total sales of high end fpd masks decreased by million  while sales of high end ic photomasks increased by million 
by geographic area  net sales in as compared to decreased by million or in asia  by million or in north america  and by million or in europe 
as a percent of total sales in  sales were in asia  in north america  and in europe 
by geographic area  compared to  net sales in asia decreased million or  north american sales decreased million or  and european sales decreased million or 
net sales for increased to million as compared to fiscal year  due principally to increased sales of fpd photomasks  as a result of increased consumer demand for fpd applications 
this increase was somewhat mitigated by decreased sales of ic photomasks of as a result of reduced demand for mainstream ic photomasks 
total sales of high end photomasks  which include fpd and ic  increased to in as compared to in fpd revenue for increased to million as compared to million in high end technology applications typically have higher asps  for both ic and fpd photomasks 
high end photomask applications include mask sets for semiconductor designs at and below nanometer for ics  and for fpd products using g and above technologies 
by geographic area  compared to  net sales in asia increased million or  north american sales decreased million or  and european sales increased million or 
gross margin percent change to to gross margin gross margin gross margin decreased to in from in primarily due to decreased asps for both ic and fpd photomasks and the company s increased manufacturing base in asia 
the company operates in a high fixed cost environment and to the extent that the company s revenues and utilization increase or decrease  gross margin will be positively or negatively impacted 
the gross margin percentage for fiscal could be negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense associated with the company s recent capital expenditures  principally for its us nanofab and for pkl  its subsidiary in korea 
gross margin decreased slightly to of net sales for as compared to in as a result of the company s increased infrastructure and expanded manufacturing capability which includes increased high end ic manufacturing capability and increased fpd capacity  principally with the opening of the taiwan fpd facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses percent change to to s  g a expense of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased compensation expense  which was partially offset by start up expenses related to the us nanofab 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to  primarily due to the company s expanded asian infrastructure  which includes expansion in shanghai  china and taichung  taiwan  and increased stock compensation expenses of million related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
research and development percent change to to r d expense to net sales research and development expenditures consist primarily of global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced sub wavelength reticle solutions for ic and fpd technologies 
research and development expenses decreased in both and as compared to each prior year as a result of cost savings associated with the closure of the company s austin  texas research and development operations  which were in part offset by amortization expenses of the fair value of the agreement to license technology from micron 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges in the second quarter of  the company continued to streamline its operating infrastructure in north america by ceasing the manufacture and research and development of photomasks at its austin  texas facility 
the company recorded total restructuring charges of million in  primarily comprised of million related to the impairment of facilities and equipment and million relating to workforce reductions of approximately employees in the united states 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
this ongoing assessment could result  in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be predicated by market conditions and customer requirements 
gain on sale of facility in january  the company sold its austin  texas manufacturing and research and development facility for proceeds of million and realized a gain of million 
other income expense interest expense investment and other income  net total other income expense interest expense decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of the company s repaying the remaining outstanding balance of its million  convertible subordinated notes upon maturity on december  investment and other income net  for  decreased as compared to  primarily due to reduced foreign currency gains and reduced investment income associated with reduced investment balances 
further  realized gains on the sales of investments and other assets were million in as compared to million in interest expense increased in as compared to due to increases in interest rates as the company s interest rate swap contract effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
investment and other income increased in as compared to primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of million in as compared to million in  net realized gains on the sales of certain investments of million in as compared to million in  and interest income of million in as compared to million in further  investment and other income  net  for includes early extinguishment charges of million relating to the redemption of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes 
income tax benefit provision income tax benefit provision effective income tax rate the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax treatments 
pklt  the company s fpd manufacturing facility in taiwan  is accorded a tax holiday which expires in december in addition  the company has been accorded a tax holiday in china which is expected to expire in in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the company s tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of ongoing and future examinations and has provided accruals for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended october  was million or of pretax income  which differs from the federal statutory income tax expense rate of  primarily as a result of a recognized tax benefit of million and to a lesser extent available tax credits in korea 
during the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded a tax benefit in the amount of million relating to the resolution and settlement of us and foreign tax matters that were associated with certain tax positions in prior years 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended october  was million on a pre tax income of million 
the provision differs from the federal statutory rate of as a result of taiwan s tax holiday  available tax credits in korea  and valuation reserves on losses generated in the united states 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
the valuation allowance increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not have a significant impact on the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  which represents the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea  was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in minority interest expense is due to decreased net income of the company s non wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan 
the company s ownership in its subsidiary in korea was at october  and october   and at october  the company s ownership in its subsidiary in taiwan was at october   october  and october  the company increased its ownership in its subsidiary in korea from to during fiscal for cash of approximately million  and further increased its ownership to in for cash of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources october  october  october  in millions in millions in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities the company s working capital decreased million to million as of the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease was partially related to reduced short term investments and accounts receivables due to decreased sales in additionally  in there was an increase in accounts payable  primarily related to million of increased accrued capital expenditures compared to the prior year 
during fiscal the company paid off million of the remaining outstanding balance of the company s convertible subordinated notes which matured on december  cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to lower accounts receivable balances associated with decreased sales as well as increases in accounts payable partially offset by decreased accrued liabilities 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal decreased to million  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of the initial payment of million to micron for the investment in mp mask and related technology license and supply agreements having been made in fiscal and a decrease in the purchase of short term investments from million in to million in capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditure payments for fiscal to be approximately million to million  primarily to continue the expansion of its high end ic manufacturing capability 
in  cash used in financing activities was million  which is primarily related to the company s redeeming its million outstanding convertible subordinated notes in december in  cash provided by financing activities was million  which was primarily a result of net proceeds from long term debt of million to support the start up of the new facility in china 
on june   the company entered into a credit agreement with a group of financial institutions that provides for a year  credit facility with an aggregate commitment of million at october  in connection therewith  the company has classified its million  convertible subordinated notes due april  as long term 
the credit facility allows for borrowings in various currencies 
the applicable interest rate spread and facility fee vary based upon the company s senior leverage ratio 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is subject to compliance with certain financial and other covenants  as defined  including  but not limited to senior leverage ratio  total leverage ratio and minimum unrestricted cash balances  and limits the amount of both secured and unsecured debt 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of the company s stock in certain of its subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a libor rate  as defined  plus basis points 
as of october   million of the credit facility was utilized for a standby letter of credit  and the remaining balance of million was available to the company 
the company s commitments represent investments in the tooling of the us nanofab  additional manufacturing capacity  as well as advanced equipment for the production of high end  more complex photomasks in asia  principally korea 
at october   the company had capital commitments outstanding of approximately million  primarily related to equipment for its us nanofab facility and equipment in korea  plus million principal amount for a build to suit capital lease through for its us nanofab facility 
the company will use its working capital and its credit facility to finance its capital expenditures 
photronics believes that its currently available resources  together with its capacity for growth  and its access to other debt and equity financing sources  will be sufficient to satisfy its currently planned capital expenditures  as well as its anticipated working capital requirements for the fiscal year 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash  short term investments and its credit facility 
cash requirements the company s cash requirements in fiscal will be primarily to fund operations  including spending on capital expenditures  mp mask commitments  and debt service  including its million  subordinated convertible notes due april   as well as any cash acquisitions that it may undertake 
the company expects that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations  along with borrowings under its million credit facility  along with access to other debt and equity financing sources  if needed  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations  cash available under its credit facility  existing cash and short term investments 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of october  in millions payments due total less than year years years more than years long term borrowings operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations interest total certain transactions the company has a ownership interest in the mp mask joint venture that was established in with micron 
since the company does not control this venture  the company does not consolidate the results 
as part of the joint venture  various supply agreements exist between the company  micron  and mp mask 
as of october   the company owed mp mask million and had a receivable from micron of million primarily related to the supply agreements 
during  the company recognized net revenue of million related to commissions earned under supply agreements between the company  micron and mp mask  comprised of gross commission income of million less million of amortization of the value of the supply agreement intangible asset 
the gross commission revenue includes million in orders from micron less the company s cost of the corresponding orders placed with mp mask in the amount of million 
in addition  in the company incurred outsourcing expenses of million from mp mask for research and development activities purchased by the company 
further  the company recorded cost of sales in the amount of million for photomasks produced by mp mask for sales to the company s customers in as of october   the company owed mp mask million and had a receivable from micron of million 
during  the company recognized net revenue of million related to commissions earned under supply agreements between the company  micron and mp mask  comprised of gross commission income of million less million of amortization of the value of the supply agreement intangible asset

in addition  in the company incurred outsourcing expenses of million from mp mask for research and development activities purchased by the company 
in  the company invested an additional million in mp mask 
also  the company purchased excess equipment from mp mask for use in its us nanofab in the amount of million in in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  a capital lease agreement commenced with micron for the us nanofab for total capital lease payments by the company of million  of which million represents interest and million represents both principal and the cost of the facility 
the chairman of the board of the company is also the chairman of the board and majority shareholder of a company who is a supplier of secure managed information technology services 
another director of the company is also a shareholder  ceo and executive vice chairman of this company 
since  the company has entered into various service contracts with this company to provide services to all of the company s worldwide facilities 
the company incurred expenses of million in  million in  and million in related to services provided by the company  for which the amount owed to this company was million at october  and million at october  in  the company signed a new year service contract with this company for million per year 
an officer of the company is also the ceo  president and director of one of the company s majority held subsidiaries 
the company purchases photomask blanks from a company of which this officer of the company is a significant shareholder 
the company purchased million  million  and million of photomask blanks from this company in   and  respectively  for which the amount owed to this company was million at october  and million at october  the company believes that the terms of the transactions described above with affiliated persons were negotiated at arm s length and were no less favorable to the company than the company could have obtained from non affiliated parties 
during fiscal years and  the company acquired substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of its non wholly owned subsidiary in korea  pkl 
as part of the purchase of outstanding shares in  the company acquired  shares or from employees  including officers  of pkl for  won per share or us dollars per share 
two of these employees were also officers of the company 
the total purchase price of million from pkl employees represents a premium of approximately per share above similar purchases of stock from other stockholders during the same time period 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense for the year ended october  was million  as compared to million for the year ended october   substantially all of which is in selling  general and administrative expenses 
no compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory  and no income tax benefit has been recorded 
as of october  total unrecognized compensation cost of million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average amortization period of years 
business outlook a majority of the company s revenue growth has come from  and is expected to continue to come from  the asian region as customers increase their use of manufacturing foundries located outside of north america and europe 
additional revenue growth is also anticipated from north america and europe as a result of utilizing technology licensed under the company s technology license with micron 
the company s korean and taiwanese operations are non wholly owned subsidiaries  therefore a portion of earnings generated at each location is allocated to the minority shareholders 
the company continues to assess its global manufacturing strategy as its sales volume continues to grow in asia 
in addition to the restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of relating to closing the austin facility  this ongoing assessment could result in the future  in facilities closures  asset redeployment  workforce reductions  and the addition of increased manufacturing facilities  all of which would be based on market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained in this filing involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
various factors that have been discussed and a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant accounting estimates include management s review of long lived assets and goodwill for potential impairment  income tax provision  allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory valuation allowances and restructuring reserves 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the company s consolidated statements of income or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments  including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in areas such as projected interest rates and changes in the company s stock price during the contract term 
the company s derivatives primarily relate to cash flow hedges to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
actual fair values may differ from estimated fair values 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  a technology license agreement and a supply agreement 
these assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis or another method that more fairly represents the utilization of the assets 
the future economic benefit of the carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed annually and the company uses judgment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors and an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
the company recognizes the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets purchased as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized to earnings  but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
a review of goodwill completed in the second quarter and the fourth quarter found no impairment 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates an impairment might exist 
the company completed its required annual impairment tests in fiscal  and  and it was determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives was not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimate of future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs of disposition 
investment in joint venture investments in joint ventures over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence and that  in general  are at least percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income loss of the joint venture 
these investments are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
an impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  the company would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the equity company  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the equity company  and its longer term intent of retaining the investment in the equity company 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required if realization is not likely by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company makes estimates and assumptions and uses judgment relating to discounts and estimates for product return and warranties  which are accrued and recognized at the time of sale 
discounts sales discounts are negotiated with customers prior to billing and at the time of billing  sales invoices are prepared net of negotiated sales discounts 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the immaterial amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specifications 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of revenue recognition  a liability is established for these items 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r on october   using the modified prospective method 
subsequently  compensation expense is recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income  over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
the company recognizes expense for all stock based compensation with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
for awards with graded vesting granted prior to october   the company continues to recognize compensation cost over the vesting period following accelerated recognition as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company adopted the alternative transition method provided in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
r for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on weekly averages of its historical volatility over a term approximately equal to the grant s estimated option life 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
the company does not engage in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  among other criteria the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
contract payments were made on a libor based variable rate at october  and are received at the fixed rate 
this swap expired in december when the company repaid the remaining outstanding balance of its convertible subordinated notes 
at this time  the company does not have plans to enter into additional interest rate swap contracts  however  at a future point the company may decide to do so 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the principal functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar  chinese renminbi and singapore dollar 
the principal functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound and euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk to foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital 
in some instances  the company may sell products in a currency other than the functional currency of the country where it was produced 
to date  the company has not experienced a significant foreign exchange loss on these sales 
however  there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of october  included the korean won  the singapore dollar  the new taiwan dollar  the chinese renminbi  the british pound and the euro 
as of october   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the us dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of other non us dollar currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april   the company s korean subsidiary entered into a foreign currency rate swap contract which was maintained throughout under the terms of the contract  the company has effectively converted a million interest bearing intercompany loan denominated in us dollars to korean won 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the intercompany loan and the related swap were reduced to a balance of million 
this contract was initially scheduled to expire in december  however  it has been extended to november the company elected not to designate the foreign currency rate swap contract as a hedge which results in a mark to market adjustment in the income statement 
in september   the company entered into forward contracts to convert the fixed yen purchase price of certain equipment into fixed us dollar amounts 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash flow and are evaluated for effectiveness 
the company records these derivative instruments in either other current assets or non current assets or accrued liabilities  depending on their net position  at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognized in earnings or in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting as defined by sfas no 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings at october  was in the form of a convertible subordinated note with a fixed interest rate of and certain unsecured international notes payable which bear interest at rates ranging from to at october   and ranging from to at october  the million net carrying value of its convertible subordinated note was repaid by the company in december in addition  the interest rate swap contract discussed above subjects the company to market risk as interest rates fluctuate on the million notional amount of the contract 
at october  and october   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in net variable rate financial instruments which were sensitive to interest rate risk 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in either or
