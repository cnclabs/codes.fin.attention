cash flows generated by these entities  combined with the issuance of commercial paper  long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures  to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions  and to repurchase shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
cash flows generated from operating activities  our primary source of liquidity  are principally from premiums  fee income and investment income 
any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
the level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases 
this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses  the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes  which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs 
in  a hypothetical unexpected increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately million 
change in capital structure 
on october   we announced that we may increase the debt component of our capital structure to the percent range of debt to total capital 
effective with our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of and share repurchases through year end  the debt component of our capital structure increased to 
refer to financing activities below for further detail of the debt issuances  including the february issuance 
these events increased our debt to total capital ratio and will reduce our weighted average total cost of capital 
this change will also increase our interest expense during  and thereafter as applicable 
as a result of this announcement on october   standard poor s s p downgraded our senior debt rating one notch from a to a and our commercial paper rating one notch from a to a 
s p maintained our outlook at stable for both our senior debt and commercial paper 
on january   moody s downgraded our senior debt rating to baa and returned our outlook to stable 
moody s affirmed our commercial paper rating at p with a stable outlook 
on january   fitch downgraded our senior debt rating to a with a stable outlook and maintained our commercial paper rating at f with a stable outlook 
the interest rates on our debt and commercial paper did not change as a result of the change in debt ratings 
we believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders equity  while maintaining appropriate liquidity 
operating activities net cash flows from operating activities totaled billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
cash from operating activities in decreased from by million  or  due to a reduction in working capital cash flows of billion partially offset by an increase of million in net income 
the decrease in working capital cash flows was driven by lower medical costs payable growth primarily related to ovations medicare programs as the operating cash flows benefited from the initial establishment of the medical costs payable balance related to the medicare part d program  fewer income tax refunds received in as well as larger income tax payments and the timing of certain government payments and receipts 
overall  our receivables and related days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of these governmental timing differences  while our commercial business receivables remained relatively flat 
investing activities net cash flows used for investing activities totaled billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively

financing activities net cash flows used for financing activities totaled billion for net cash flows from financing activities totaled million and million for and  respectively 
debt transactions 
in february  we issued a total of billion in senior unsecured debt  which included million of floating rate notes due february  million of fixed rate notes due february  billion of fixed rate notes due february and billion of fixed rate notes due february the floating rate notes are benchmarked to the london interbank offered rate libor and had an initial interest rate of 
on the same date  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are benchmarked to the libor on the february and february notes with an aggregate notional amount of approximately billion 
in november  we issued million of zero coupon notes due november these zero coupon notes are original issue discount notes with an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of approximately billion and an accretion yield of 
these notes have a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes at the accreted value at certain annual dates in the future  beginning on november  in november  we issued a total of billion in senior unsecured debt  which included million of fixed rate notes due november  million of fixed rate notes due november  million of fixed rate notes due november and million of fixed rate notes due november these notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under section of the securities act of act 
in january  we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the act 
we expect to complete the exchange in february in june  we issued a total of billion in senior unsecured debt  which included million of floating rate notes due june  million of fixed rate notes due june and million of fixed rate notes due june the floating rate notes due june are benchmarked to the libor and had an interest rate of at december  these notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under section of the act 
in january  we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the act 
we expect to complete the exchange in february in march  we issued a total of billion in senior unsecured debt to refinance outstanding commercial paper 
we issued million of floating rate notes due march  million of fixed rate notes due march  million of fixed rate notes due march and million of fixed rate notes due march the floating rate notes due march are benchmarked to the libor and had an interest rate of and at december  and  respectively 
pacificare had approximately million par value of convertible subordinated debentures convertible notes which were convertible into approximately million shares of unitedhealth group s common stock and million of cash as of december  in december  we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture governing the convertible notes 
the compensation consisted of the present value of interest through october   the earliest mandatory redemption date  plus a pro rata share of million 
on january   approximately million of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer  for which we issued million shares of unitedhealth group common stock  valued at million  and cash of million and amended the indenture governing these notes 
during  approximately million of convertible notes were tendered for conversion  for which we issued  shares of unitedhealth group common stock  valued at approximately million  and cash of approximately million 
in september  we notified the remaining holders of our intent to fully redeem all outstanding convertible notes on october   the earliest redemption date 
as of october   all convertible notes were tendered pursuant to this redemption notice 
hedging activities 
to more closely align interest costs with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalent and investment balances  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from fixed rates to variable rates 
the interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of billion as of december   with variable rates that are benchmarked to the libor 
as of december   the aggregate asset  recorded at fair value  for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately million 
these interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges and are accounted for using the short cut method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  whereby the hedges are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value  and the carrying value of the long term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
since these amounts completely offset  we have reported both the swap asset and the debt liability within debt in our consolidated balance sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from to 
stock repurchases 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common stock repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices  subject to certain restrictions on volume  pricing and timing 
during  we repurchased million shares which were settled for cash on or before december  at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
during  we repurchased million shares which were settled for cash on or before december  at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
as of december   we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares 
we expect to repurchase approximately billion of our common stock in capital resources as of december  and  we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our debt to total capital ratio was and as of december  and  respectively 
commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities up to days 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  debt ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and market conditions 
we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 
however  a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 
see cautionary statements for additional information 
cash and investments 
we maintained a strong liquidity position  with cash and investments of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
total cash and investments increased by billion since december   primarily due to strong operating cash flows  the issuance of debt  and proceeds received from common stock issuances related to exercises of share based awards  partially offset by common stock repurchases  repayments of debt  capital expenditures  and funds paid to centers for medicare medicaid services cms under the medicare part d program 
as further described under dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
at december   approximately billion of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use  including acquisitions and common stock repurchases 
shelf registration 
in february  we filed a universal s shelf registration statement with the sec registering an unlimited amount of debt securities 
ratings 
currently  our senior debt is rated a with a stable outlook by s p  a with a stable outlook by fitch  and baa with a stable outlook by moody s 
our commercial paper is rated a with a stable outlook by s p  f with a stable outlook by fitch  and p with a stable outlook by moody s 
debt covenants 
our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper  debt and shareholders equity below 
we were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of december  on august   we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our senior unsecured notes due march  alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities 
this followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
bank credit facilities 
in november  we entered into a billion day revolving credit facility in order to expand our access to liquidity 
the credit facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under this bank credit facility 
in may  we amended and restated our billion five year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program 
we increased the credit facility to billion and extended the maturity date to may as of december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
in october  we entered into a billion day revolving credit facility 
effective august   we elected to reduce the amount of this facility to billion 
this credit facility expired on october  dividend restrictions 
we conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
in and  based on the previous years statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amounts of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval were billion and billion  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the company s regulated subsidiaries paid approximately billion and billion in dividends to their parent companies  including approximately million and million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators  respectively

we believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote 
calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term 
for variable rate obligations  we used the rates in place as of december  to estimate all remaining contractual payments 
includes unamortized discounts from par values 
includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services  including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty 
excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at december  estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity 
under our reinsurance arrangement with oneamerica financial partners  inc oneamerica these amounts are payable by oneamerica  but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay 
we have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from oneamerica in our consolidated financial statements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin 
since the timing of future settlements are uncertain  the long term portion has been classified as thereafter 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
includes remaining capital commitments for equity investment funds and the investment commitment related to the pacificare acquisition discussed below 
includes future payments to optionholders related to the application of section a  as well as obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and charitable contributions related to the pacificare acquisition discussed below  which have been classified as thereafter due to uncertainty regarding payment timing 
the table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in march  at the time we occupy the facility  and extend over a year period with total estimated lease payments of million 
in conjunction with the pacificare acquisition we committed to make million in charitable contributions for the benefit of california health care consumers  which has been accrued in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have committed to specific projects totaling approximately million of the million charitable commitment at december   of which million was paid 
additionally  we agreed to invest million in california s health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the california marketplace  of which million was invested at december  the timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion subject to the advice and oversight of the local regulatory authorities  however  our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of the investment commitment remains in place for years after funding 
the unfunded charitable commitment and investment commitment have been included in the above table 
at december   we had pending cash acquisitions 
see note of notes of the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
we do not have any other material contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
medicare part d pharmacy benefits contract beginning january   the company began serving as a plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with cms 
the company contracts with cms on an annual basis 
under medicare part d  members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium  typically with an initial annual deductible  coinsurance of for the member and for the company up to an initial coverage limit of  of annual drug costs  no insurance coverage between  and  except the member gets the benefit of the company s significant drug discounts  and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of  covered approximately by cms  by the company and by the member up to an annual out of pocket maximum of  the company s contract with cms includes risk sharing provisions  wherein cms retains approximately to of the losses or profits outside a pre defined risk corridor 
the risk sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the company in its initial contract application 
contracts are generally non cancelable by enrollees  however  enrollees may change plans during an annual enrollment period each year 
as a result of the medicare part d product benefit design  the company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs early in the contract year 
while the company is responsible for approximately of a medicare part d beneficiary s drug costs up to  the beneficiary is responsible for of their drug costs from  up to  at the company s discounted purchase price 
consequently  the company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs in the first half of the contract year as compared with the last half of the contract year  when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the  initial coverage limit 
the uneven timing of medicare part d pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of the year that entitle the company to risk share adjustment payments from cms 
accordingly  during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk share receivable from cms in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
this represents the estimated amount payable by cms to the company under the risk share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period 
those losses are typically expected to reverse in the second half of the year 
total premium revenues from cms related to the medicare part d program and all other medicare related programs were approximately of our total consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended december  as of january   certain changes were made to the medicare part d coverage by cms  including the initial coverage limit increased to  the catastrophic coverage begins at  the annual out of pocket maximum increased to  the risk share provisions take effect if actual costs are more than above or below expected costs 
cms retains to of the losses or profits outside this risk corridor 
these changes result in an increase in the amount of losses or profits that we may realize from this contract in as the amount of risk retained by cms has diminished 
aarp we provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp 
these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare aarp medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance  health insurance focused on persons between to years of age  and other products supplemental health insurance program 
under the supplemental health insurance program  we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk 
we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings 
premium revenues from our portion of the aarp supplemental health insurance program were approximately billion in  billion in and billion in the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp medicare supplement insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf 
the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue  medical costs  investment income  administrative expenses  member service expenses  marketing expenses and premium taxes 
underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders  unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf 
to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf  we would have to fund the deficit 
any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract 
to date  we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits 
as further described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract 
under separate trademark license agreements with aarp  we sell aarp branded medicare prescription drug benefit plans and medicare advantage plans 
we pay aarp a license fee for the use of the trademark and member data and assume all operational and underwriting risks 
on october   we entered into new agreements with aarp which amended our existing arrangements 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  health care professional contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care professional and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can be up to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
historically  the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than of annual medical costs  less than of annual earnings from operations and less than of medical costs payable 
in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us as of the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
we do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors 
accordingly  for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control  as well as through a review of near term completion factors 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in factor increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in factor increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical cost payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in medical costs pmpm trend data used in developing medical cost payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period  one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period 
the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations favorable development increase decrease to medical costs a medical costs earnings from operations in millions as reported as adjusted b as reported as adjusted b c  c  c a the amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year 
b represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development 
c not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in will change as our december  medical costs payable estimate develops throughout our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding the aarp business  earnings from operations would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as of december   we had long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets and property  equipment and capitalized software  of billion 
we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability  we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows  which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
investments as of december   we had approximately billion of investments  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary  based on analysis of relevant factors  we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
we analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
see cautionary statements for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation 
legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report and is incorporated by reference herein 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as of december   we had an aggregate billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk

cautionary statements relating to our historical stock option practices matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices  including regulatory inquiries  litigation matters  and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in early  our board of directors initiated an independent review of the company s historical stock option practices from to the independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the company independent committee with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors 
on october   we announced that the independent committee had completed their review of the company s historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the non management directors of the company 
as a result of our historical stock option practices  we restated our previously filed financial statements  we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters  and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges  the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
regulatory inquiries as previously disclosed  the sec and the us attorney for the southern district of new york are conducting investigations into the company s historical stock option practices and the company has received requests for documents from the minnesota attorney general and various congressional committees in connection with these issues and the company s executive compensation practices 
we have not resolved these matters 
we cannot provide assurance that the company will not be subject to adverse publicity  regulatory or criminal fines  penalties  or other sanctions or contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters 
in addition  we may be subject to additional regulatory inquiries arising out of the review of the independent committee  the review of a special litigation committee  consisting of two former minnesota supreme court justices  appointed by our board of directors to review claims asserted in federal and state shareholder derivative claims relating to our historical stock option practices special litigation committee  and the related restatement of our historical financial statements 
regulatory inquiries may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business

litigation matters we and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action  an employment retirement income security act of  as amended erisa class action  and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historical stock option practices 
we also have received shareholder demands relating to those practices 
in addition  following our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our senior unsecured notes due march  alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands 
in addition  we may be subject to additional litigation  proceedings or actions arising out of the independent committee s review  the special litigation committee s review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements 
litigation regulatory proceedings or actions may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential additional cash and noncash charges while we believe we have made appropriate judgments in our restated financial statements in determining the financial impacts of our historical stock option practices  we cannot provide assurance that the sec will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impacts  including the adjustments that we made based on our determination of the measurement dates for our historical stock option grants 
if the sec disagrees with our financial adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements  we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  other adjustments for non operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option related matters arising under litigation and the above referenced regulatory reviews  the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material 
cautionary statements relating to our business if we fail to effectively estimate and manage our health care costs  the profitability of our risk based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products comprise approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences 
our revenue on medicare policies is based on bids submitted in june the year before the contract year 
we base the premiums we charge and our medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period  however  medical cost inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding 
if these estimates prove too low  they will have a negative impact on our future results 
if we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in federal and state regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
the broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations  as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions  including integration of certain acquisitions 
delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past  and may do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  medical malpractice litigation  consumer driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms  confidentiality of health information  and government sponsored programs 
for example  from time to time  congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted  could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa 
additionally  there have been legislative attempts to limit erisa s preemptive effect on state laws 
if adopted  such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
in addition  the health care industry is subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services  requiring us to change our products and services  or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
in august  we entered into a multi state national agreement with regulatory offices in states relating to the legacy unitedhealthcare fully insured commercial business 
the agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations  including claims payment accuracy and timeliness  appeals and grievances resolution timeliness  health care professional network service  utilization review  explanation of benefits accuracy  and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance 
the agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to august and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through december on a prospective basis  the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee  whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states 
we must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement  or be subject to fines and penalties 
we are also involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these regulatory activities include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the us department of justice  us attorneys  the sec and other governmental authorities 
reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions  which can result in the assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business  loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
for example  in  the california department of managed health care and the california department of insurance examined our pacificare health plans in california 
as a result of these examinations  the california department of managed health care has assessed a penalty of million related to its findings 
the california department of insurance  however  has not yet levied a financial penalty related to its findings 
in addition  public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price  damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 
our business providing pbm services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the pbm industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in connection with the pacificare merger  we acquired a pbm business  prescription solutions 
we also provide pbm services through unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions 
prescription solutions and unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions are subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
in the event a court were to determine that our pbm business acts as a fiduciary under erisa  we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies  preferred drug listings and drug management programs  contracting network practices  specialty drug distribution and other transactions 
our pbm business also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 
we also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy  including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate 
for our health care services segment  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services 
for our prescription solutions business  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of other businesses 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier or health care professional arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals  physician groups and other care professionals in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
if we do not complete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services  if membership does not increase as we expect  if membership declines  or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
a reduction or less than expected increase in medicare and medicaid program funding and or our failure to retain and acquire medicare  medicaid and state medicaid children s health insurance programs schip enrollees could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
we participate as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  and various medicaid and schip programs and receive revenues from the medicare  medicaid and schip programs to provide benefits under these programs 
our participation in these programs is through bids that are submitted periodically 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms 
funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities 
a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our ability to retain and acquire medicare  medicaid and schip enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors 
under the medicaid managed care program  state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs 
if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts  we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans 
under the medicare part d program  to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members  our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold  which is set by the government after our bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold  we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us 
for example  we lost approximately  of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members in because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government 
in general  our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors bids and positioning are different than anticipated  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or otherwise  our financial results could be materially affected 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices and services 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional 
to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
further  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and in health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa 
hipaa also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates as such term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
in addition  despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
compliance with any privacy proposals  requirements  and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us or by one of our vendors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and results of operations 
our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
under our agreements with aarp  we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and non members 
one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarp branded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and non members 
our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers 
the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including  depending on the agreement  a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of the company  material changes in the medicare programs  material harm to aarp caused by the company  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  meet our corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  and diversity commitments  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to various litigation actions  which  if resolved unfavorably to us  could result in substantial monetary damages 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees  customers  and contracted and non contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 
we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks 
although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages in some circumstances  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters  however  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving systems and regulatory standards  and changing customer patterns 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
in addition  failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products  our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired  our results of operations  shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 
due largely to our recent acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   representing approximately of our total assets 
if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance 
we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated 
a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts  or  in some states  any amount 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
downgrades in our debt ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders 
downgrades in our ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results  business and prospects 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments  acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions 
if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results 
fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position 
volatility in interest rates affects our returns on  and the market value of  fixed income and short term investments  which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at december  in addition  defaults by issuers  primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds  who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments  which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 
we also invest a smaller proportion of our investments in equity investments  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions  and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices 
the company s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt 
approximately billion of our investments at december  were debt securities 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely align the fixed interest rates of our long term debt with the variable rates of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  approximately billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and billion had fixed rates as of december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
at december   we had million of equity investments  a portion of which were held in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio
