item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and formulates over the counter products  prescription drugs  and dietary supplement products that use our patented cdt technology 
our drug delivery business generates royalty revenue from cdt based sales in the dietary supplement markets 
however  we will continue to incur significant net losses as we advance preclinical research and clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our product candidates  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support commercialization of our potential products 
our results of operations going forward will be dependent on our ability to commercialize our products and technology and generate royalties  development fees  milestone  and similar payments 
while our strategy includes a significant commitment to research and development activities in connection with the growth of our drug delivery platform  we do not expect to initiate significant new programs unless we obtain additional sources of funding 
we have generated substantially all of our working capital through the sale of equity securities 
on december   we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
purchasers of our stock also received warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable for five years 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately million 
on april   we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after placement agent fees of approximately  and other direct and incremental offering costs 

table of contents on november   the securities and exchange commission declared effective our registration statement that we filed using a shelf registration process 
under this process  we may offer from time to time in one or more offerings common stock and or warrants to purchase common stock at an aggregate public offering price of up to million 
as of december   approximately million remained available for issuance under this shelf registration statement which expires in november critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
all professional accounting standards effective as of december   have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from collaborative agreements  licensing fees  and from the assignment of developed and patented technology 
we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of revenue to recognize each period 
revenue under collaborative arrangements may take the form of up front payments  payments for milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  and licensing payments 
we recognize license revenue from intellectual technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
up front payments 
up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized as licensing fees on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  we make an estimate of the time required to achieve that goal considering our experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
we review the basis of our revenue recognition and adjust it as necessary based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
license fees 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
royalty income 
royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products and revenue is calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development income 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when the milestone has been achieved  as long as the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  there was substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone  and the payment is non refundable 
each milestone event must have substance  and must represent the achievement of specific defined goals 
reimbursements of research and development expenses we incur in connection with collaborative agreements are recognized as revenue at the time these amounts are determined to be measurable  reliable  and collectable 
our judgment in determining the collectability of amounts due impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
credit worthiness and collectability are assessed  and when a party is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
we also assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and use estimates and judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of up front payments  license fees  research and development income  and royalty income revenue to be recognized each period 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we issued warrants in a private placement financing which contain registration rights where significant liquidated damages could be required to be paid to the holder of the instrument in the event a registration statement covering the resale of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants fails to remain effective for a preset time period 
we account for these warrants at fair value in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s stock 
the black scholes option pricing valuation model is used to determine the fair value of these warrants 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and risk free interest rates 
deferred taxes valuation allowance we make estimates and use our judgment in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we may consider any potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which we made such determination 
at december   we had recorded full valuation totaling approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 
change in accounting for fair value of warrants to purchase common stock we have previously classified warrants we issued as a part of our february   private placement as a liability because we agreed to pay liquidated damages to warrant holders in the event that the effective sec registration statement registering the resale of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants does not remain effective 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf  which provides guidance on the impact the registration rights have on the classification of the warrants 
based on the guidance of the fsp  we now evaluate separately the warrants and the registration rights obligations and we reclassified the fair value of the warrant liability to stockholders equity on january  the amount we reclassified was  which was based on the fair value of the warrant liability at december  the fair value of the entire arrangement at inception was  the difference between the fair value of warrant liability at inception and december   was  however  we previously reclassified  as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
the adoption of fsp eitf had no effect on our net loss 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of  compared to million for the same period in royalty revenue from our cdt based product sales to the dietary supplement markets increased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in largely as a result of royalties generated through our alliance with perrigo 
the increase in royalty income during from our alliance with perrigo was offset by a decrease in research and development income due to the termination of our agreement with wyeth consumer healthcare in march royalty payments from perrigo are based solely on perrigo s net profits of cdt based products which involve uncertainties and are difficult to predict 
revenues from perrigo declined in the second half of primarily as a result of the discontinuation of one of our products at a large customer 
however  we expect sales to increase in as the product will be reintroduced at the large customer in  and as a result of increasing sales of our calcium product was introduced in late revenues from nutraceutix will decline in  as a result of the termination of the license agreement on december  licensing fees increased in due to the recognition of the outstanding balance of deferred licensing revenue

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this slight increase was primarily due to a  increase in our outside manufacturing  supplies and clinical trial expenses  and a  increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits 
these increases were offset by a reduction of  in license expense associated with amendments to our license agreements with temple university and archer daniels midland company in in august  we amended our license agreement with temple university to reduce the royalty rate for prescription drugs under the salt patent

table of contents unrealized gain on the fair value of warrants liability was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of  for the same period in the unrealized gain represented the change in fair value of the liability associated with warrants issued in connection with our february private placement 
the fair value was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the gain and loss recorded in and  respectively  resulted from a decline and increase in the fair value of our common stock during the respective years 
the increase in interest income was attributable to higher cash balances and interest rates 
net loss net loss increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to our higher operating expenses  including costs associated with the amendments to our license agreements with temple university and adm  and non cash share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r 
the impact of these items on net loss was offset by increases in revenue and other income 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of working capital compared to million as of december  we have accumulated net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  including million and million in net proceeds from our registered direct offerings in december and april  respectively  and million from our private placement in february net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million in compared to million in we used cash of million for operating activities in  which was million less than the amount used for operations during expenditures during this period decreased as a result of reduced general and administrative expenses  which was offset by increased marketing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was  in  compared to million in  primarily due to the decreased application of maturing short term investments 
we expect our operating losses and negative cash flow to continue as we continue preclinical research and clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  and develop our product candidates 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at planned levels through early we plan to continue the costly process of simultaneously conducting clinical trials and preclinical research for multiple product candidates 
we will need to raise additional capital to fund operations  continue research and development projects  and commercialize our products 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
we anticipate that we will need to seek additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or other sources of financing during the issuance of a large number of additional equity securities could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders and could cause a decrease in the market price for shares of our common stock  which could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the issuance of equity securities 
if we are unable to obtain necessary additional financing  our ability to run our business will be adversely affected and we may be required to reduce the scope of our development activities or discontinue operations 
as of december   our commitments to make future payments under long term contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total year to years to years more than years operating leases term loan total we have certain material agreements with our manufacturing and testing vendors related to our ongoing clinical trial work associated with our development programs 
contract amounts are paid based on materials used and on a work performed basis 
generally  we have the right to terminate these agreements upon days notice and would be responsible for services and materials and related costs incurred prior to termination

on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf opinion related to eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the task force reached a consensus that a collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves two or more parties  all of which are both a involved as active participants in a joint operating activity that is not conducted primarily through a separate legal entity and b exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the joint operating activity 
this issue also addresses i the income statement classification by participants in a collaborative arrangement for transactions with third parties and transactions between the participants and ii financial statement disclosures 
the consensus on eitf issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
entities should apply the consensus retrospectively to all periods presented for only those collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date  unless it is impractical to do so 
we will adopt this new accounting pronouncement effective january   and do not anticipate any material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

eitf is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we will adopt this new accounting pronouncement effective january   and do not anticipate any material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
