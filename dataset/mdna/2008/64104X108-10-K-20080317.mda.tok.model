item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings disclosure statement and risk factors 
overview we are a global provider of information technology  or it  services and end to end business solutions designed to help clients improve their competitiveness and effectiveness 
end to end business solutions encompass all stages of a client s business process and incorporate all technologies and it services related to that process 
our portfolio of solutions and services includes outsourcing  system integration and application development  software and consulting  and quality assurance and training 
the primary industries  or verticals  we serve include government and defense  financial services  life sciences and healthcare  telecommunications and utilities  and independent software vendors  or isvs 
we have operations in countries across north america  europe and asia 
we combine our deep vertical expertise and strong technical capabilities to provide a complete range of high quality services on a global scale 
by integrating our local and international personnel in focused business and project teams  this global delivery model leverages our corporate knowledge and experience  intellectual property and global infrastructure to develop innovative solutions for clients across the geographies and verticals we serve 
we complement this global delivery model with our offshore delivery capabilities to achieve meaningful cost reductions or other benefits for our clients 
our revenues increased to million for  from million for net income decreased to million for  from million for  primarily as a result of fourth quarter charges in respect of the arbitration settlement agreement signed in january with a former client with whom we were in dispute over a contract issue  representing million  the strength of the rupee versus the dollar  representing million  expenses related to our management transitions of million  a third quarter expense associated with our arbitration process which delayed our ability to provide the solution at issue to another client and resulted in cancellation of the purchase  representing million  and losses from our united kingdom operations of million  partially offset by a strong contribution to net income from our nesspro global business of million and a reduction in financial expense  representing million 
our revenue growth is attributable to a number of factors  including acquisitions we made  increases in the number and size of projects for existing clients  and the addition of new clients 
our client base is diverse  and we are not dependent on any single client 
in  no client accounted for more than of our revenues and our largest twenty clients together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for  the 
table of contents percentage of our revenues derived in aggregate from agencies of the government of israel was 
existing clients from prior years generated more than of our revenues in our backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this million increase in our backlog was due primarily to new bookings 
we achieve backlog through new signings of it services projects and outsourcing contracts  including for new and repeat customers 
we recognize backlog as revenue when we perform the services related to backlog 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  it professionals 
of the  employees  approximately  were in israel   were in india   were in europe  were in north america and were in the asia pacific region 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and which could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from contracts for system integration and application development services  outsourcing  consultation  quality assurance and training services as well sales of third party software licenses 
we provide services on either a fixed price or time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as services are performed based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated billing rates 
we also charge our clients for certain costs and expenses  such as the installation of hardware and cost of subcontractors 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term development projects 
such projects that require significant customization  integration and installation are recognized in accordance with sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenues related to these contracts using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs expected upon completion 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the resources and time required to fulfill the contracts obligations including work effort and subcontractors 
we rely on our experience from other projects in making these estimates  and  in addition  use our internal project management and financial systems to track and manage the projects 
employees and project managers regularly submit updates to these systems  which are then used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
these systems  which are updated on a regular basis by inputs from employees and project managers estimates  produce analyses and are used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
historically  our estimates have been indicative of our actual results  however  there have been a few cases where we had to adjust assumptions  primarily regarding work effort 
we generally recognize revenues on a gross basis  representing the entire amount  because we bear the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and have latitude in establishing product pricing above specific minimums 
management determines whether we bear the risks and rewards of ownership based on relevant sale contract terms 
whenever the majority of contract terms indicate that we bear the risks and rewards  revenues are recognized on a gross basis 
for most software license sales and hardware sales  we record revenues on a net basis  based on management s determination that majority of contract terms indicate that we do not bear the risks and rewards related to such contracts 

table of contents for arrangements that involve multiple revenue activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products and services  management allocates the associated consideration to the separate activities based on their relative fair values 
in order to determine the fair values of the different activities covered by each agreement  management applies standard pricing used for products and services in similar arrangements and hourly rates based on similar activities we have performed for other clients 
our revenue recognition approach for software licensing requires that  in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition as amended  four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the credit worthiness of each client based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in each financial period  we estimate the likelihood of collecting every receivable and record a cumulative allowance 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license and service sales  maintenance agreements  customer contracts and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and discount rate 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on adoption and at least annually thereafter or between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital for the reportable unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill 
realizability of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived tangible and intangible assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying 
table of contents amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in measuring the recoverability of assets  we are required to make estimates and judgments in assessing our forecast and cash flows and compare that with the carrying amount of the assets 
additional significant estimates used by management in the methodologies used to assess the recoverability of our long lived assets include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long tem growth rates  market acceptance of products and services  and other judgmental assumptions  which are also affected by factors detailed in the risk factors section of this annual report 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our long lived assets 
tax accounting we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations 
the effective tax rate was  and for  and our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
legal contingencies we are the defendants in various lawsuits  including employment claims and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our business 
in determining whether provisions should be recorded for pending litigation claims  we assess the allegations made and the likelihood that we will successfully defend ourselves 
when we believe that it is probable that we will not prevail in a particular matter  we then estimate the amount of the provision required based in part on our legal counsels advice

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer  who evaluates our performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit 
on january   we completed the reorganization of our operations into operating segments 
on january   we expanded our managed strategic services mss segment to include the non financial services portions of ness ibs  a component of our other segment  and changed the name of mss to ness north america  and we moved the ness uk organization from our other segment to our ness europe segment

segment operating profit is defined as income from operations excluding unallocated headquarters costs 
expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling  general  administrative and delivery costs 
certain general and administrative expenses and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management believes they are not directly attributable to any specific segment 
accordingly  these expenses are categorized as unallocated expenses and adjusted against our total income from operations 
additionally  our management has determined that it is not practical to allocate certain identifiable assets by segment  when such assets are used interchangeably among the segments

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the company beginning january  the fasb issued a fasb staff position to defer the effective date of sfas for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we do not expect the adoption will have material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value

r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no

minority interests will be recharacterized as non controlling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change of control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to non controlling interests will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk instruments or purchase hedging or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts and do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we have direct operations in different countries and commercial relationships in many other parts of the world 
our foreign operations contract with clients in their applicable local currencies or dollars 
as a result  we are subject to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates in those countries where we conduct business 
our earnings are predominantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the indian rupee 
thus  an increase of in the value of the indian rupee relative to the us dollar in would have resulted in a decrease in the us dollar reporting value of our operating income in by million  while a decrease of in the value of the indian rupee relative to the us dollar in would have resulted in an increase in the us dollar reporting value of our operating income in by million 
in order to minimize the effect of such movements on our earnings  we entered into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure against foreign currencies which differ 
table of contents from the local functional currencies 
in the future  we may enter into additional forward foreign currency exchange or other derivatives contracts to further hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
in the future  we may be subject to interest rate risk on our investments  which would affect their carrying value
