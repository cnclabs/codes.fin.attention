refer to forward looking statements cautionary language on page i and risk factors that may affect future performance beginning on page  for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks  and assumptions associated with these statements 
executive overview the company operates primarily in the aerospace and defense industry and its principal business is providing aircraft maintenance and modification services to military customers 
the company s services are provided under traditional contracting agreements that include fixed price  time and material  cost plus and variations of such arrangements 
the company s revenue and cash flows are derived primarily from services provided under these contracts  and cash flows include the receipt of milestone or progress payments under certain contracts 
during the third quarter of  the company sold its pemco world air services  inc pwas subsidiary to was aviation services  inc  an affiliate of sun capital was 
the company recorded a gain of million  net of tax  related to the sale of pwas 
the sale of pwas allowed the company to pay off its revolving credit facility  treasury stock term loan and bank term loan the bank debt with wachovia bank and compass bank 
in addition to eliminating the bank debt  the sale provided approximately million of cash for future working capital needs 
as part of the transaction in which the company sold pwas to was  the company changed its name from pemco aviation group  inc to alabama aircraft industries  inc pwas historically comprised substantially all of the css 
the historical financial results of pwas have been presented in the company s consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
on september   the company sold the assets and operations of pemco engineers  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company pemco engineers which  are presented in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations  pemco engineers was previously included in the mcs segment 
as discussed in detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s financial condition and prospects have been adversely impacted by several extraordinary events in connection with the us air force usaf kc pdm program as a subcontractor to the boeing company and the related recompetition for the new kc contract award 
in summary  from may through june  the company worked in cooperation with boeing to submit a proposal on the new kc contract under a memorandum of agreement with boeing moa 
after filing an initial proposal with the usaf  which included critical financial and operational information on the company s kc program  the company believes boeing breached the moa due to the usaf s reducing the number of aircraft in the request for proposal 
as part of the company s teaming arrangement with boeing on the existing kc contract  the company had already spent several million dollars to meet boeing s new requirement that the company adopt its kc methodology 
the company requested  and the government agreed  to open the competition to additional potential suppliers 
aaii birmingham developed an independent proposal which was submitted to the usaf in september a request for a final proposal revision was released by the usaf in mid january  to which the company responded on february  the company s proposal for the kc pdm program was unsuccessful as the contract was awarded to boeing in september the company filed a protest with the government accountability office gao and the contract was stayed for days pending the results of the protest 
on december  the gao upheld in part the company s protest on the basis that the usaf failed to conduct a proper analysis of boeing s cost price proposal for realism or potential risk 
the usaf filed a request for reconsideration on january   which was denied by the gao on february  on march   the usaf advised the company that in response to the recommendation by the gao it had completed additional review  documentation and a new award decision and that the company s proposal was not selected for award 
company officials attended a debriefing from the usaf on the new award decision on march  the company filed a protest on the new award decision on march  as to the usaf s lack of proper evaluation to meet gao recommendations and sudden post award change of work scope under the contract recompete 

table of contents in order to adjust for and mitigate the effects of the past events discussed above  the company has taken several significant steps 
on november  the company officially qualified with the small business administration as a small business for military contracts 
the company believes that this will provide vital opportunities for defense contracts which were previously unavailable 
management has also taken significant steps to reduce costs including headcount reductions  administrative cost reductions  freezing the defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees as of december   eliminating salary increases for and restructuring the medical and dental benefit plans 
negotiations are in process with the union for similar cost reductions 
in addition  the board of directors  in a unified move to support the company  has agreed to a reduction in all board fees for if the new protest does not result in a positive outcome for the company  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and prospects  materially harm the company s business and impair the value of its common stock 
the company and boeing continue to be teamed on the kc bridge contract for which the usaf exercised a second six month option to extend through september  there are no assurances that the company will receive more than the three aircraft already inducted during these extensions of the kc bridge contract 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as a result of the awarding of the kc contract to the boeing company and the lack of other long term contracts in conjunction with the sale of pwas  which generated significant pretax income during and  there is insufficient evidence for the company to conclude as of december  that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets recorded by the company would be realized 
during  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset accounts which substantially increased the reported income tax expense in results of operations twelve months ended december  versus twelve months ended december  the table below presents major highlights from the years ended december  and excluding the results of discontinued operations  except for net income 
in millions change revenue gross profit operating loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations before taxes loss from continuing operations net income ebitda from continuing operations the company defines operating loss from continuing operations  as shown in the above table  as revenue less cost of sales  less selling  general  and administrative expenses 

table of contents ebitda from continuing operations for the years ended december  and was calculated using the following approach in millions loss from continuing operations interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations the company presents earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  more commonly referred to as ebitda  because its management uses the measure to evaluate the company s performance and to allocate resources 
in addition  the company believes ebitda is an important gauge used by commercial banks  investment banks  other financial institutions  and current and potential investors  to approximate its cash generation capability 
accordingly  the company has included ebitda as part of this report 
the depreciation and amortization amounts used in the ebitda calculation are those that were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in this report 
due to the long term nature of much of the company s business  the depreciation and amortization amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations will not directly match the change in accumulated depreciation and amortization reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
this is a result of the capitalization of depreciation expense on long term contracts into work in process 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
ebitda as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the table below presents the highlights of revenue from continuing operations by operating segment for the years ended december  and in millions change change gss mcs eliminations total the million decrease in revenue at the gss was primarily due to decreases in deliveries of kc aircraft  offset by increases in c and p deliveries 
the kc pdm program  which accounted for of gss revenue in  allows for the company to provide services on pdm aircraft  drop in aircraft  and other aircraft related areas 
revenue from the kc program decreased million during during  the company delivered pdm aircraft and two drop ins  compared to pdm aircraft and no drop ins during year over year the company realized an increase in revenue per pdm aircraft delivered in due to higher pricing on each aircraft delivered 
partially offsetting the decrease in gss revenue was an increase in revenue of million under contracts to perform non routine maintenance work on other aircraft  primarily c aircraft 
revenue increased as a result of more c aircraft in process during which increased the amount of non routine services provided to the program 
the company delivered no us coast guard uscg c aircraft during compared to two uscg c s during for depot level maintenance 
revenue from the uscg program decreased million due to this decrease in deliveries 
revenue for the p program increased million in due to the delivery of five p s during versus delivery of three p s during 
table of contents cost of sales decreased million to million in from million in cost of sales decreased at a slightly lower rate than revenue because of the fixed expenses related to operating the birmingham  alabama facility 
cost of sales was adversely affected in by million of losses on the p contract  million of losses on the usaf c contract and a charge of million related to freezing the defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees 
cost of sales was adversely affected in by million of losses on the p contract  million of losses on the usaf c contract and million of losses on the uscg contract 
gross profit at gss decreased from million to million due to decreased deliveries of kc aircraft 
overall  the company s gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in is primarily due to the decline in revenue from the kc program 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percent of revenue from continuing operations  sg a expenses increased to in from in the increase in sg a expense as a percent of revenue from continuing operations is primarily attributable to the reduction in kc revenue which was offset by cost reductions to improve the profitability of the company 
during  the company recorded income tax expense for continuing operations of million 
income tax expense for was significantly affected by a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets of million which was recorded due to the uncertainty of future taxable income as a result of the lack of significant long term contracts 
during  the company recorded income tax benefits at an effective rate of 
the company s effective tax rate is impacted by the allocation of taxable income  losses or gains between alabama and california 
revenue at mcs decreased million during versus primarily due to the termination of a large missile program in late in addition  revenue in was adversely affected because revenue on work performed on several of the larger mcs programs has been deferred due to the timing of revenue recognition milestones  the timing of receiving additional funding on projects and the timing of award fee recognition 
gross profit for the mcs decreased from million in to million in for these same reasons 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased to million in from million in the css experienced large growth in cargo conversion revenue and maintenance  repair and overhaul revenue 
the increase in volume of business increased capacity utilization at the company s former dothan  alabama facility  supplemented by work performed in mainland china 
the improvements in volume and utilization led to lower cost and increased profitability on all lines of work 
consolidated unallocated corporate sg a expenses  interest expense and income taxes during  the company incurred million of corporate sg a expenses that previously had been allocated to pwas for segment reporting purposes 
during  the company incurred million of corporate sg a expenses that previously had been allocated to pwas and pemco engineers for segment reporting purposes 
under accounting principles generally accepted in united states  these allocated amounts are recorded in continuing operations rather than discontinued operations 
total interest expense  including amounts in discontinued operations million  increased to million in from million in interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher rates on variable interest rate loans resulting from amending existing credit agreements and additional debt incurred on february  gain on sale of discontinued operations the company recorded a pretax gain of million for the sale of pwas in the third quarter of the company recorded million in tax expense on the gain due to differences in the gain on the sale for financial reporting purposes and income tax reporting purposes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity 
in thousands  except ratios december  december  change cash working capital current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations long term debt and capital lease obligations stockholders equity debt to equity ratio x x x working capital the company has no current arrangements with respect to sources of additional financing  and its negative results of operations in prior years and the current lack of long term contracts  exacerbated by the current state of the credit markets  will likely make it more difficult and expensive for the company to raise additional capital that may be necessary to continue its operations 
the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash on hand  cash flows from operations primarily from collection of accounts receivables and conversion of work in process inventory to cash and potential borrowing capability through lenders 
principal factors affecting the company s liquidity and capital resources position include  but are not limited to  the following results of operations  the results of the company s protest of the us air force usaf award of the kc contract to the boeing company  collection of accounts receivable  funding requirements associated with the company s defined benefit pension plan  settlements of various claims  and potential divestitures 
the company anticipates that cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations  make minimal capital expenditures and make scheduled payments on debt obligations for the next twelve months 
however  the company is proposing and is expecting to propose on several programs in the next twelve months 
if the company is successful in winning some or all of these programs  additional financing may be needed to fund working capital requirements related to the buildup of accounts receivable and inventory on the projects 
moreover  the company does not have sufficient cash to make the required contributions to its defined benefit pension plan without negatively impacting the cash and liquidity of the company by the end of therefore  the company applied on february  to the internal revenue service for a waiver of contributions to its defined benefit pension plan through december  without a waiver of contributions  the company would be required to contribute approximately million for the plan year by september  contribution calculations for the plan year have not been completed 
the company currently estimates that the quarterly payments for the plan year will be approximately million to million with the first quarterly payment due april  several events could significantly impact the generation  availability and uses of cash over the next twelve months including whether the company is successful in its protest of the usaf award of the kc contract to the boeing company  whether the company is granted a waiver of contributions to its defined benefit pension plan through december   whether the company sells its subsidiary  space vector corporation  in whether the company is able to win additional contracts  including in part as a result of qualifying with the small business administration as a small business under certain north american industry classification system codes  and whether the company is able to get additional funding from lenders to fund working capital increases needed if additional contracts are won 

table of contents there are no assurances that the company will be successful in any of these respects and negative outcomes could adversely impact the company s ability to meet financial obligations as they become due

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management use judgments to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
as a result  there is some risk that reported financial results could have been materially different had different methods  assumptions  and estimates been used 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity as used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue at the gss is derived principally from aircraft maintenance and modification services performed under contracts or subcontracts with government and military customers 
the gss recognizes revenue and associated costs under such contracts on the percentage of completion method as prescribed by statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts generally provide for routine maintenance and modification services at fixed prices detailed in the contract 
any nonroutine maintenance and modification services are provided based upon estimated labor hours at fixed hourly rates 
the company segments the routine and the nonroutine services for purposes of accumulating costs and recognizing revenue 
for routine services  the company uses the units of delivery method as the basis to measure progress toward completion  with revenue recorded based upon the unit sales value stated in the contract and costs of sales recorded based upon actual unit cost 
an aircraft is considered delivered when work is substantially complete and acceptance by the customer has occurred by execution of a form dd for nonroutine services  the company uses an output measure based upon units of work performed to measure progress toward completion  with revenue recorded based upon the stated hourly rates in the contract and costs of sales recorded based upon estimated average costs 
the company considers each task performed for the customer as a unit of work performed 
revenue and costs of sales are recognized upon completion of all performance obligations in accordance with the contract 
such work is performed and completed throughout the pdm process 
the mcs derives a portion of its revenue from cost reimbursement types contracts accounted for under the principles prescribed by sop and from sales of precision parts and components 
revenue on cost reimbursable contracts is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of estimated fee earned 
for certain other fixed price 
table of contents contracts  revenue is recognized when performance milestones have been achieved in accordance with contract terms 
revenue related to sales of individual components and parts is recognized upon delivery to the customer  and when the product price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks and estimating contract revenues and costs 
the company employs various techniques to project contract revenue and costs which inherently include significant assumptions and estimates 
contract revenues are a function of the terms of the contract and often bear a relationship to contract costs 
contract costs include labor  material  an allocation of indirect costs  and  in the case of certain government contracts  an allocation of general and administrative costs 
techniques for estimating contract costs impact the company s proposal processes  including the determination of pricing for routine and nonroutine elements of contracts  the evaluation of profitability on contracts  and the timing and amounts recognized for revenue and cost of sales 
the company provides for losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which management determines that the estimated total costs under the contract will exceed the estimated total contract revenues 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and any revisions are charged or credited to operations in the period in which the change is determined 
an amount equal to contract costs attributable to claims is included in revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is required in determining the potential realization of claim revenue and estimating the amounts recoverable 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimates required in these processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could result from the use of different assumptions or if the underlying conditions were to change 
in addition  contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion  units of delivery method may result in material fluctuations in revenue and profit margins depending on the timing of delivery and performance  the relative proportion of fixed price  cost reimbursement  and other types of contracts in process  and costs incurred in their performance 
for additional information regarding accounting policies the company has established for recognizing revenue  see revenue recognition in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the specific identification method 
this method involves subjectivity and includes an evaluation of historical experience with the customer  current relationship with the customer  aging of the receivable  contract terms  discussions with the customer  marketing  and contracts personnel  as well as other available data 
given the nature of the gss and mcs business and customers  write offs have historically been nominal 
gss and mcs customers are primarily the us government or its prime contractors 
inventory reserves the company regularly estimates the degree of technological obsolescence in its inventories and provides inventory reserves on that basis 
though the company believes it has adequately provided for any such declines in inventory value to date  any unanticipated change in technology or potential decertification due to failure to meet design specification could significantly affect the value of the company s inventories and thereby adversely affect gross profit and results of operations 
in addition  an inability of the company to accurately forecast its inventory needs related to its maintenance obligations could adversely affect gross profit and results of operations 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
machinery  equipment and improvements and impairment machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
in the case of leasehold improvements  the useful life is the shorter of the lease period or the economic life of the improvements 
the company estimates the useful lives based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
should the actual useful lives be less than estimated  additional depreciation expense or recording a loss on disposal may be required 
the company reviews machinery  equipment and improvements for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and performs impairment tests on groups of assets that have separately 
table of contents identifiable cash flow 
the company compares the carrying amount of the assets with the undiscounted expected future cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  assets classified as held and used are written down to fair value and are depreciated over their remaining useful life  while assets classified as held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell 
the actual fair value may differ from the estimate 
pension and postretirement plans the company maintains pension plans covering a majority of its employees and retirees  and postretirement benefit plans for retirees that include health care benefits and life insurance coverage 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs income are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets  assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees  and an annual rate of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare benefits 
each of these assumptions is based upon the company s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual asset returns for the company pension plans significantly below the company s assumed rate of return would result in lower net periodic pension income or higher expense in future years 
actual annual rates of increase in the per capita costs of covered postretirement healthcare benefits above assumed rates of increase would result in higher net periodic postretirement benefit costs in future years 
insurance reserves the company is partially self insured for employee medical coverage and workers compensation claims 
the company records a liability for the ultimate settlement of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date based upon estimates provided by the companies that administer the claims on the company s behalf 
the company also reviews historical payment trends and knowledge of specific claims in determining the reasonableness of the reserve
