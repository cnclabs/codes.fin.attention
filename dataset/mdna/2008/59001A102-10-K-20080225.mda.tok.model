item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions the industry continues to be challenged by the difficult homebuilding market downturn 
based on u 
s 
census bureau data  single family home starts in the united states dropped to their lowest level since and for  there were fewer than  units sold  a decrease from their annualized peak in january although inventory of new homes available for sale at december  has dropped to below  units in the united states for the first time since late  this balance still represents months supply 
demand for homes continues to be low due to the lack of consumer confidence and the reduced availability of mortgage financing as a result of the tightening of underwriting standards and a weakening of credit markets 
based on research conducted by inside mortgage finance publications  total mortgages originated in decreased approximately from  with decreases ranging from for alt a  subprime and arm originations for the same time period 
for us  as well as for the industry as a whole  excess new and existing home supply  including those homes available as a result of increased foreclosure activity  has led to increased competition and margin compression 
we believe that home buyers are and will continue to defer purchasing decisions until they believe the price declines have reached bottom 
additionally  for those buyers motivated to take advantage of current competitive pricing conditions  the tightening of mortgage financing  as well as difficulty in selling their existing homes  are causing high cancellation rates and lower net orders 
as the competitive pressures in the industry have increased  homebuilders have offered additional incentives and discounts  which has exacerbated the industry s performance 
summary company results our results for the year ended december  reflect this deterioration in the homebuilding and credit industries over the past several quarters 
total home closing revenue was billion for the year ended december   decreasing from billion for and from billion in we incurred a net loss for of million compared to earnings of million in and million in the net loss was primarily due to million pre tax of goodwill related impairments and million pre tax of real estate related impairments recorded in we incurred million of real estate impairments in  and none in additionally  lower average home prices from competitive pressures and the increased use of incentives over the last two years lowered gross margins generated on home closings to in  from and  respectively  in and at december   our backlog of approximately million was down from billion at december  our december  backlog was billion 
fewer home sales  compounded by increased price concessions and incentives  were primarily responsible for these declines 
our average sales price for homes in backlog decreased from  at december  to  at december  and  at december  our cancellation rate on sales orders was  and  respectively  as a percentage of gross sales  for the years ended december   and we expect that cancellation rates will begin to stabilize as the excess supply of home inventory is absorbed and home prices return to normalized levels 
company actions and positioning in response to industry conditions  we are focusing on the following initiatives consolidating overhead functions at our divisions to reduce our general and administrative cost  reducing unsold home inventory and significantly limiting construction of speculative homes  reducing our total lot supply by renegotiating or opting out of lot purchase and option contracts  reducing our inventory levels of unsold homes caused by late stage cancellations by focusing our sales efforts on those homes  reducing direct construction costs by renegotiating with our subcontractors where possible  stopping or limiting spending for mid to long range land development projects  increasing sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic  monitoring our customer satisfaction scores and making improvements based on the results of these surveys  and reducing our debt levels and interest cost 
in september  we amended our credit facility  which matures in although the amendment permanently decreased our capacity under the credit facility from million to million  it allows for a reduction in the minimum interest coverage ratio  our most restrictive covenant  providing additional flexibility to sustain ourselves during the downturn and take advantage of opportunities as the industry emerges from its recession 
during the fourth quarter of  we paid down a substantial amount of the debt under our credit facility from cash generated by operations  reducing the outstanding balance from million at september  to million at december  despite current market conditions  we believe we are positioned to weather the current homebuilding industry downturn  and to take advantage of opportunities as the market improves 
continuing population growth in our key regions  our supply of inventory of entitled land in desirable locations  and regulations that constrain the development of raw land in many of these key markets  favor our geographic position 
coupled with this strong inventory position  we believe that our product diversification  respected brands  solid balance sheet and management experience position us for future growth when the homebuilding market stabilizes 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations  particularly as related to our ability to accurately estimate stock based compensation  accruals  or impairments of real estate or goodwill that could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  are as follows revenue recognition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize revenue from home sales when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community 
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual lots on a relative value basis 
the costs of these lots are transferred to homes under construction when construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community are allocated on a relative value basis to the remaining homes in the community 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
therefore  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 
typically  our building cycle ranges from four to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the entitled land and continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary  based on the size of the community and the associated absorption rates 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby also extending the lives of certain communities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
requires that impairment charges are to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis 
our analysis is completed on a quarterly basis at community level  therefore  changes in local conditions may effect one or several of our communities 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
existing and continuing communities when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from existing communities are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are deemed not fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
the fair value of the communities assets is determined using various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models with impairments charged to cost of home closing in the period during which the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
our key estimates in deriving fair value are i home selling prices in the community adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace  and iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned 
option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing communities section above  we determine if the contributions to be generated by our future communities are acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that the communities are still profitable and generating acceptable margins  the assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we determine to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
we may also elect to continue with a project that may not be generating an accounting profit due to expected future cash flow that may be generated or other factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land real estate inventories and real estate related joint venture investments 
additionally  we wrote off million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer feasible 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our operations in each state are considered a reporting unit 
the fair value of reporting units is determined using various valuation methodologies  including discounted future cash flow models and enterprise value computations 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
if goodwill is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds implied fair value of that goodwill 
inherent in our fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of our analysis 
in addition  to the extent that there are significant changes in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our goodwill has been assigned to reporting units in different geographic locations 
therefore  potential goodwill impairment charges resulting from changes in local market and or local economic conditions or changes in our strategic plans may be isolated to one or a few of our reporting units 
however  a widespread decline in the homebuilding industry or a significant deterioration of general economic conditions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of several or all of our reporting units 
during  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units based on a discounted projection of future cash flows  supported with a market based valuation of our company as a whole  and concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for our reporting units 
based on these results  the goodwill balance was impaired million in  resulting in a full write down of all of our remaining goodwill 
there were no such impairments in or see note for additional information 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our contracts generally require subcontractors to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are generally responsible for such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover potential costs for materials and labor as they relate to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are determined based on our and industry wide historical data and trends with respect to product types and geographical areas 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting to of a home s sale price 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by million in while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
all of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because the criteria for consolidation set forth in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r have not been met 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as loss earnings from unconsolidated entities  net 
we use our business judgment to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of  or have a controlling interest in  an unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include the profit loss sharing terms of the entity  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
as of december   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not have a controlling interest  and our ownership interest exceeds 
at december   our equity investments of million related to unconsolidated entities with total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these investments 
we also enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we analyze these agreements under fin r to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity vie  if applicable  using a model developed by management 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies do not impact our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance  if based on the evidence available  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in making the assessment under the more likely than not standard  appropriate consideration must be given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods by jurisdiction  unitary versus stand alone state tax filings  the company s experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unutilized  and all tax planning alternatives that may be available 
in making the determination of whether we are in a cumulative loss position under sfas no 
 we use a a four year measurement period and base the determination on net income or loss before income taxes for the current and prior three years 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million of which million related to the net state deferred tax asset after a valuation allowance of million 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net federal deferred tax asset of million will be fully realized and does not require a valuation allowance 
at the state level  a valuation allowance was determined to be necessary due to the magnitude of loss in non unitary states  no carry back of loss being allowed at the state level  and shorter carry forward periods in a few of the states where we are doing business 
share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock nonvested shares outstanding under two stock compensation plans 
per the terms of these plans  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
additionally  no options granted under the plans may be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
thereafter  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
prior to january   we accounted for stock option awards granted under our compensation plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
share based employee compensation expense was not recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to january   as our stock options had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock on the date of the grant and therefore  no intrinsic value 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  our compensation expense recorded since january  includes both charges related to the vesting of options and restricted stock granted since the adoption of sfas no 
r as well as compensation cost related to the unvested portions of options granted prior to january  for all compensation cost recorded  fair value of the options was determined using the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgements 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding

companywide 
home closing revenue decreased to billion in  as compared to our company record revenue of billion in the sharp decline in the homebuilding market throughout late and translated to a  unit decrease in home closings and an decrease in average sales price in as compared to these decreases reflect our higher cancellations  resulting in lower net sales  as well as the increased use of discounts and incentives  which further impacted our sales prices 
home closing revenue increased to a company record of billion in from billion in the factor primarily leading to this increase was the strong demand and pricing power relating to sales orders  which were realized in the closings 
average selling prices on homes closed rose from to and we benefited from an increase in the number of homes closed in to  from  in west 
the continued deterioration of the homebuilding market was most evident in our west region  which experienced a dramatic market correction from the peak of the market up cycle in although our cancellation rate in for the region of as a percent of gross sales slightly improved from the rate in and the companywide average of  the slower closing volumes and increased use of incentives led to a decrease in closing revenue to million for california in the difficult market conditions are also evident in the decrease in california s home closing volume of  and the decrease in average sales price of  per home in  as compared to in  the west region experienced a revenue decline 
as some markets in the western united states were first to feel the impacts of the downturn in the housing markets  closings in in both dollars and volume reflected our reduced pricing power and high cancellations  particularly in california 
the decrease in california home closing revenue to million in compared to million in reflects a decrease in the number of homes closed and a decrease in the average selling price of homes closed 
in nevada  strong sales performance in early resulted in the number of homes closed increasing in  producing home closing revenue of million  an increase of compared to central 
in  the declines in arizona were partially offset by the increased results in texas and colorado 
arizona s million decrease in home closings reflects the current oversupply of homes inventory in the local market as well as the inability of move up buyers to sell their existing homes or willingness to commit to a new home purchase as they are not yet comfortable that the market has reached a bottom 
texas has experienced an increase in closing revenue of  due to an increase in average sales price  partially offset by closed units decreasing only homes to  in as compared to  primarily due to a strong backlog and relative stability in sales volumes during colorado has also increased its closings to units at an average price of  in versus units and  average sales price in as it ramps up its startup operations from in  sales mix and strong orders were the primary drivers behind the overall increased results in the central region 
home closing revenue increased million to billion as compared to billion in both arizona and texas had a year of record closings in  with  and  homes closed  respectively  increases of and over additionally  average sales price increases of and  respectively  in arizona and texas in as compared to further contributed to the year s strong performance 
east 
during  we began to wind down our ft 
myers operations  which was the primary cause of the million reduction in home revenues and unit reduction in closings in as compared to additionally  the average sales price in orlando our other florida market is traditionally lower than in ft 
myers  which  combined with the additional use of discounts  resulted in an decrease in average sales price in versus during  we closed homes  generating revenue of million 
the increase in revenue is due to both increased volume and the higher average sales price of  as compared to  in  although activity only reflects closings since the date of the respective florida acquisitions 
home orders 
companywide 
home orders for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include orders contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
throughout  the uncertainty in the market was evident through lower sales volume  which was further exacerbated by high cancellation rates driven by consumer uncertainty and lower sales prices  generated by increase in incentives and discounts in an attempt to find the local market s niche 
in  we sold  homes as compared to  in the prior year  with a decrease in average sales price to  our cancellation rate  as a percentage of gross sales  was  compared to in  in and our historical average of to 
in  we took home orders for  homes  a decrease of compared to the  home orders in primarily due to the decline in demand in many of our homebuilding markets  partially offset by home sales at new communities  which increased by to actively selling communities at december  west 
our west region continues to be the most impacted by the homebuilding downcycle 
consumer confidence in california and nevada is still low  and homeowners are hesitant to commit to a home purchase until they feel that their new home will not lose value 
additionally  sub prime market failures and resulting tighter underwriting standards are also making it more difficult for buyers to qualify for mortgages to purchase their new home and for move up buyers to sell their existing homes 
all of these factors contributed to the million decline in sales volume to million in as compared to million in  with fewer homes and a lower average sales price 
our west region posted significantly weaker order volume in  decreasing in the value of home orders  with our fourth quarter order value for this region also falling  reflecting the continued slowing from the unusually robust sales pace seen in previous years in these markets 
central 
the central region experienced a million decline to billion of sales in as compared to billion in this decline is primarily due to million and unit decline in arizona and a million and unit decline in texas in versus although texas has been experiencing recent declines in sales volume and average selling prices  as it did not participate in the market upcycle in recent years  its overall decreases have been relatively minimal to date 
in  a weaker housing market in arizona contributed to a decrease in the value of home orders in arizona 
while average sales price per home held steady due to changes in sales mix offsetting price decreases  the number of home orders declined  to  for the region  reflecting the deterioration in the local market from the strong demand a year earlier 
in texas  despite a very competitive market  we experienced moderate demand in all of our markets and received orders for  homes valued at billion in  increases of and  respectively  compared to  home orders with a value of million in additionally  the central region increased its number of actively selling communities to as of december   as compared to a year ago  also offsetting slower sales and high cancellations 
east 
our sales volume increased by homes to million as compared to million in the increase is mainly due to improved performance in our central florida operations  which opened three new communities during the year 
we also had slightly positive sales volumes in ft 
myers as compared to negative full year sales units and dollars in in  the number of home sales in florida decreased by orders to units worth million  a and decrease over this decrease is due to the extremely difficult market conditions in ft 
myers naples  where demand and pricing power have declined at a faster pace than the rest of the nation 
order backlog 
companywide 
our backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
as discussed  the homebuilding downturn and resulting decreasing pricing power  higher cancellation rates and the closing all contributed to a or million decrease in our backlog to million as compared to billion in the decrease is attributed to both the lower volume of backlog homes to  units in versus  units in and the lower average sales prices of  in  a decrease from our backlog was billion at december   a decrease of compared to billion at december  and was comprised of  homes  a decrease compared to december  our homes in backlog at december  reflect an average sales price of  a decrease of compared to  at the same time a year ago 
these decreases are primarily the result of declining housing markets in many of our markets  as reflected by decreased pricing power and higher cancellation rates  coupled with record closings in west 
as noted previously  our west region s poor sales volumes and weak local homebuilding markets translated to a or million decrease in backlog dollars to million as of december  the homebuilding market continues to be very challenging in california and nevada  and we do not anticipate relief in the current market conditions until the existing supply of new and existing home inventory is absorbed 
in  the west region experienced a decrease in dollar backlog as compared to in california  we had a decrease in the dollar value of backlog of  reflecting weaker demand in the fourth quarter  while nevada s backlog units represent an decrease over the prior year 
high cancellation rates were a primary factor causing the reduced backlog 
central 
the central region backlog decreased  units and million to  units and million at december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to unit declines of and from to in texas and arizona  respectively  as well as decreases in average sales price  mostly from the decrease in average sales price in arizona during the period 
as of december   the central region had  homes in backlog  a decrease of over in arizona  the number of homes in backlog decreased and the value of those homes decreased 
these results were partially offset by texas  where homes in backlog increased to  from  at december  with an increase of in value to million 
east 
backlog at december  was million and homes  and decreases from  respectively 
as mentioned above  the wind down of operations in ft 
myers  coupled with modest decreases in the rest of florida  were the primary cause for these declines 
we ended with homes in backlog in florida with a value of million  decreases of and  respectively  from the poor homebuilding market conditions and high cancellation rates  particularly in ft 
myers naples  were the main cause for these declines 
other operating information years ended december  in thousands home closing gross loss profit west home closing gross loss profit percent of home closing revenue central home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue east home closing gross loss profit percent of home closing revenue total home closing gross profit percent of home closing revenue home closing gross profit 
companywide 
home closing gross profit represents home closing revenue less cost of home closings  including impairments 
cost of home closings include land and lot development costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  impact fees  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
home closing gross profit percentage decreased to in as compared to in  primarily as a result of real estate related impairments 
the gross margins of were comprised of home closings generated by sales in mid to late and early during the homebuilding market boom and therefore  were less impacted by the homebuilding cycle downturn  although they do include some real estate related impairments 
home closing gross profit for of million includes million related to real estate related impairments 
in  we recorded million of such impairments 
these impairments were recorded as part of our quarterly review of the fair value of our real estate assets and the determination that the acquisition of certain properties under contract was no longer economically viable 
excluding these charges  gross margins were million  or for  and million  or in going forward  we believe that as prices continue to reflect the current state of the homebuilding industry  our margins will remain at levels lower than the historically high levels experienced during the last two years 
in addition  home closings in communities that have been previously impaired  which have sub standard margins  will continue to negatively impact our average gross margin percentages 
in recent quarters  we have also increased the number  type and amount of incentives we offer  as reflected by lower average sales prices in our backlog 
the types of incentives we offer vary from market to market  community to community and model to model and may include a discount on home price  free or discounted upgrades and options  and the payment of a portion of the buyer s closing costs 
continuing incentives  which impact sales prices  can also be expected to have an adverse effect on our gross and net margins over the next several quarters 
our companywide gross profit of is basis points below our gross profit of 
our gross profit included real estate inventory impairments and write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs of million  which is of total home closing revenue 
excluding such charges  our and margins are relatively comparable as many of the closings reflect the favorable pricing conditions of  when many of these homes were sold 
west 
our west region experienced a significant drop in home closing gross profit to a gross loss of million for  due to real estate related impairments and the continuing trends of lower average sales price of closed homes driven by weak demand  as previously discussed 
gross profit was million in  a difference of million 
the region recorded million and million of real estate related impairments for and  respectively  which impacted home closing gross margins 
excluding these impairments  gross margin would have been and for the same periods 
for  home closing gross profit decreased basis points over to 
the margins reflect our declining pricing power and increased use of incentives in  coupled with home construction costs holding steady when compared to the robust homebuilding environment of margins in were further impacted by inventory impairments and write downs of options and pre acquisition costs 
the west region recorded million of impairment and write downs  reducing the gross profit margin by 
central 
the central region s home closing gross profit for decreased basis points  as compared to in despite these decreases  margins in this region remained positive due to the minimal impairments recorded in texas 
the decrease is attributed to both the decrease in pricing power in arizona  as well as the shift in the region s mix to texas closings  as texas  which has historically had lower home gross margins  continues to become a more significant portion of the region s  and of the company s  total sales and closings 
we expect to have lower gross margins throughout the central region also recorded million of real estate related impairments that impacted home closing gross margins in  compared to million in the impairment charges reduced gross margin by and basis points in and  respectively 
the central region experienced a basis point increase in gross profit percentage in to as compared to this increase is due primarily to the mix of homes sold in arizona  with higher margin communities contributing a larger percentage of the sales 
the central region also recorded million of impairments and write downs as discussed above 
east 
this region  like the west  experienced a home closing gross loss when compared to a year ago  with a gross loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to gross profit of million for the prior year 
the home closing gross losses are due to million of real estate related impairments during the impairment charges in the prior year were million 
excluding these impairments  gross margin would have been and for the region for and  respectively 
the gross margins in were also impacted by the difficult market conditions experienced in ft 
myers naples 
the east region had home closing profit of during the basis point decline is due to both the inventory impairments recorded during  as well as the weakened homebuilding market  particularly in ft 
myers naples  where significant price concessions and sales incentives were utilized in order to remain competitive in the local market 
total impairments and write downs aggregated to million during  of the region s home closing revenue for the year 
years ended december  in thousands commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total closing revenue benefit provision for income taxes dollars percent of earnings before provision for income taxes commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  as a percentage of home closing revenue  increased to for from for these increases are primarily the result of a basis point increase in our commission costs as a percentage of closing revenue due to the larger number of homes sold with the participation of outside commissioned sales agents 
this increase also reflects additional costs incurred for increased sales and marketing efforts across our markets  as well as a larger number of model homes resulting primarily from a increase in community count to at december  versus at december  commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  increased as a percent of home closing revenue to in from in this increase was primarily due to the weakened housing markets  which resulted in the increased involvement of external real estate agents who are paid a higher commission than our internal sales force  and additional sales and marketing efforts targeted at improving our competitiveness in this challenging market 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in to million as compared to in our balance includes million related to tender offer costs associated with the cancellation of certain employee and director stock options  and million of severance and related costs 
the balance includes million of severance costs  primarily from the resignation of our former co ceo 
excluding these charges  our general and administrative expenses were and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the current year s general and administrative costs reflect our concentrated efforts to control overhead expenses  a million reduction in dollars of administrative expenses in as compared to the reductions are mostly due to lower salaries and compensation expense resulting from decreases in employee head count and other cost cutting measures 
general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue in from in the increase is primarily attributed to million pre tax of charges related to severance costs and stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  which contributed an additional basis points 
during we completed two acquisitions in florida 
these acquisitions  along with our growth in our existing markets  necessitated an expansion of our corporate infrastructure capabilities  such as accounting  internal audit  human resources  legal and information technology to prudently manage the growth of the company 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we incurred a million loss on extinguishment of debt relating to our bond refinancing  the proceeds of which were used to repurchase pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate was for  compared to for this change in our effective tax rate during compared to was attributable to a current year decrease in the allowable tax deduction for domestic manufacturing  a reduction adjustment made to a prior year domestic manufacturing deduction due to the carry back of our current federal pretax loss  decreases in unrecognized tax benefits  and decreases in state tax benefits for the current year due to the valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets 
income taxes decreased to million in from million in as a percent of pre tax earnings  taxes were in  down from in the slight decrease in is primarily attributed to an increase in the deduction related to qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  a reduction in the amount of non deductible executive incentive compensation  and the impact of incentive stock options under sfas no 
r  which was implemented at the beginning of goodwill and related impairments in  we wrote off million of our goodwill and related intangible assets as a result of the weakened homebuilding market and accounting valuation techniques that incorporate the declining stock prices in deriving the fair values of our reporting units 
these charges resulted in a complete write down of all of our remaining goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital in were operating expenses  lot development  home construction  income taxes  investments in joint ventures  land and property purchases  and the payment of various liabilities 
we use a combination of borrowings and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outflows prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cost associated with home and land construction has been previously incurred 
we believe that we have strict controls and a defined strategy for companywide cash management  particularly as related to cash outlays for land and inventory development 
although we had million of cash used by operating activities for full year  we generated over million of positive operating cash flows in the second half of  demonstrating our strict adherence to our tight cash control procedures  particularly in light of current market conditions 
the negative cash flow in the first half of was primarily due to lot inventory purchases and unsold inventory construction and carry costs 
we amended our credit facility in september this amendment provided covenant relief under our interest coverage ratio  our most restrictive covenant  creating additional flexibility to weather these difficult financial times 
however  the amendment also permanently decreased our capacity under the credit facility  which expires in  to million  from million 
if we continue to experience the continuing declines throughout our industry  we may not have sufficient liquidity under our credit facility 
additionally  if our financial condition deteriorates due to a worsening in the homebuilding industry or other factors  we may continue to be challenged to meet our covenants and we may be required to further modify the facility and assess the viability of other methods of raising equity and or debt capital 
our goal is to have adequate liquidity during the current market decline and emerge with enough resources to take advantage of opportunities when the market turnaround begins 
there can be no assurances  however  that if needed  we will be able to obtain such modifications or raise such capital on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
unsecured revolving credit facility in september  we amended our credit facility to i reduce the total facility size to million from million  ii modify the applicable interest rate by to basis points  depending upon our leverage ratio as defined  iii reduce the interest coverage ratio as defined for a period of up to nine consecutive quarters below to interest coverage reduced interest coverage period  and iv to further reduce the interest coverage ratio for a period of up to three consecutive quarters to a minimum of to interest coverage within the nine consecutive quarters partial suspension period 
in addition  during the period when the interest coverage ratio is below to  the individual quarterly interest coverage ratio cannot be less than to for more than four consecutive quarters 
during any period where the interest coverage ratio is below to  the leverage ratio as defined cannot exceed to  and the leverage ratio decreases further as the interest ratio decreases below to for each four trailing four quarter period 
the leverage ratio during the partial suspension period cannot be greater than to 
during the reduced interest coverage period  we are prohibited from paying dividends  buying back company stock or prepaying any senior or subordinated notes 
after the september amendment  the credit facility had key financial and other covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million plus of net income earned after december  plus of the aggregate net increase in tangible net worth resulting from the sale of capital stock and other equity interests as defined  prohibiting our ratio of indebtedness including accrued expenses to tangible net worth from being greater than to requiring us to maintain a ratio of ebitda including interest amortized to cost of sales to interest incurred as defined of at least to subject to reduction during the reduced interest coverage period  prohibiting the net book value of our land and lots where construction of a home has not commenced to exceed of tangible net worth plus of the aggregate outstanding and prohibiting the net book value of our raw land where grading or infrastructure improvements have not begun to exceed of tangible net worth  limiting the number of unsold housing units and model units that we may have in our inventory at the end of any fiscal quarter as follows unsold homes cannot exceed the greater of of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date or of the number of unit closings within the two fiscal quarters ending on such date  and model homes cannot exceed of the number of home closings within the four fiscal quarters ending on such date  and prohibiting us from entering into any sale and leaseback transaction  excluding the sale and leaseback of model homes 
in may  we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity to may  and make changes to certain covenants and definitions  including i changing certain aggregate asset type limitations within the borrowing base  ii increasing the minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement to million plus of consolidated net income as defined for each full fiscal quarter ending after december   plus an amount equal to of the aggregate increases in consolidated tangible net worth as defined after december  by reason of the issuance and sale of equity interests  plus an amount equal to the net worth of any person who becomes a guarantor after december  by reason of merger or acquisition and iii changing the covenants relating to restrictions on the total land and unsold units that we may own 
in june  we amended our credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity by million to million and to make certain other minor changes 
the increase in capacity was made pursuant to an accordion feature contained in the credit agreement 
this accordion feature allows us to request from time to time an aggregate increase of up to million in the maximum borrowing commitment 
each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request we make 
in addition  any increase in the borrowing capacity pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions  including the absence of an event of default 
in may  we amended and restated our credit facility to i increase the borrowing capacity from million to million  and ii extend the term from may to may at december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility  and approximately million was outstanding in letters of credit that collateralize our obligations under various land purchase  land development and other contracts 
in addition  we had approximately million in surety and performance bonds outstanding at december   and after considering our most restrictive bank covenants and borrowing base limitations  we had an additional million of our current bank facility available to borrow at that date 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed a million offering of senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued at par  and their associated proceeds were used to pay down our credit facility 
the covenants related to these senior subordinated notes are substantially similar to the covenants of our senior notes discussed below 
senior notes in march  we completed the private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the indenture which governs the senior notes contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants in the indenture that governs our existing senior notes discussed below  except that  among other things  the new indenture does not require us to maintain a certain level of minimum tangible net worth  provides that the exceptions to the limitation of the amount of additional indebtedness we may acquire with respect to purchase money indebtedness is unlimited  and with respect to other indebtedness is million  provides that the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make is limited to million plus i of net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  increases the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the new indenture  and provides for a suspension of certain covenants if the new senior notes have investment grade ratings  as defined in the indenture  including covenants relating to change of control  limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interest and certain limitations on investments and asset sales 
senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the indenture for our senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including covenants limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facility  most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness up to million  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  requiring us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  and placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with the credit facility and senior and senior subordinated note covenants 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for all outstanding balances on our senior and senior subordinated notes 
see part ii  item for additional discussions regarding our share repurchase program 
land option and purchase contracts we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
currently  our slower sales rate is causing us to take certain actions  including purchasing lots in advance of corresponding sales  re negotiating the takedown schedules  and discontinuing lot purchases and forfeiting the related non refundable option deposit 
during the first two quarters of  we purchased almost  lots for a price of approximately million 
in the latter half of  we executed on our goal to reduce lots under control and manage takedowns and only acquired approximately  lots for about million  a million reduction from the first six months of the year 
at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash along with approximately million in letters of credit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes  and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years principal  senior and senior subordinated notes interest  senior and senior subordinated notes unsecured revolving credit facility other borrowing obligations interest  other borrowing obligations operating lease obligations liabilities related to real estate not owned fin obligations including interest and penalties total as a part of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties  the monthly payments for which are typically calculated by applying a libor based rate to the agreed upon basis of the leased asset 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  at december  and  approximately and million of these transactions were included in our balance sheet as model home inventory with a corresponding debt balance  which is included in the other borrowings category above 
other payments relating to all other model home leases and other operating leases are included in the operating lease obligations category 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or seasonality we typically experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirement 
historically  we sell more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half  which results in more working capital requirements and home closings in the third and fourth quarters 
we expect this seasonal pattern to continue  although it may be affected by the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry 
recent accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and libor lending rates 
at december   we had million drawn under our credit facility that would be subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed rate debt is made up primarily of million in principal of our senior notes  million in principal of our senior notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate borrowings until we would be required to repay such debt 
the following table presents our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value 
information regarding interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity and average interest rates for the year ended december  follows december  for the years ended december  fair value at december  thereafter total dollars in millions fixed rate a average interest rate n a variable rate b b b c average interest rate n a a fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   is based on quoted market prices by independent dealers 
b balance relates to our on balance sheet model home lease program 
although we have no legal obligation to repay this amount  generally accepted accounting principles require we include this liability and a related asset in our consolidated financial statements 
the lease payments required under this program are based on the outstanding principal amount at approximately of such amount per annum 
c million relates to our revolving credit facility which carries a variable interest rate of libor plus per annum or prime 
although there is no readily available public market for this debt  we approximate that its fair value is between of its stated amount 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs
