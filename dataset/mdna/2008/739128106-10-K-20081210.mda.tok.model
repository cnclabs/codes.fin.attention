overview we develop  design  manufacture and service custom engineered to order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes 
headquartered in houston  texas  we 
table of contents serve the transportation  environmental  energy  industrial and utility industries 
our business operations are consolidated into two business segments electrical power products and process control systems 
effective september   we changed our fiscal year end from october to september therefore  our consolidated operating results and cash flows for the year ended september   are compared to the operating results and cash flows for the months ended september  on august   we purchased certain assets related to the ansi medium voltage switchgear and circuit breaker business of ge s consumer industrial unit 
the operating results of the power vac product line are included from that date and are included in our electrical power products business segment 
the power vac medium voltage switchgear product line enhances our product portfolio  comes with a large installed base and has broad customer support across utility  industrial and commercial markets 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a year supply agreement in which ge is obligated to purchase from powell subject to limited conditions for exceptions all of its requirements for ansi medium voltage switchgear and circuit breakers and other related equipment and components 
the power vac product line  together with our long term commercial alliance with ge  has expanded our position in the marketplace and enabled us to reach a broader market and gain access to new customers 
we completed the relocation of the power vac product line from west burlington  iowa  to our facilities in houston  texas  during fiscal year throughout fiscal  we experienced strong market demand for our products and services 
new investments in oil and gas infrastructure  as well as new investments by municipal and transit authorities to expand and improve public transportation  were key drivers of increased business activity in fiscal customer inquiries  or requests for proposals  continued to strengthen throughout fiscal years and this increase in customer inquiries led to increased orders in fiscal year and  accordingly  a strong backlog of orders entering into fiscal year results of operations twelve months ended september  fiscal compared to twelve months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues increased as we have responded to strong market demand by increasing our capacity and throughput 
domestic revenues increased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as a large international project was substantially completed in fiscal the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily due to higher levels of energy related investments  principally oil and gas projects

backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have maintained a positive liquidity position 
working capital increased to million at september   compared to million at september  this increase in working capital resulted primarily from increases in inventory and accounts receivable due to increased demand for our products and services 
as of september   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at september  we have a million revolving credit facility in the us and an additional million approximately million revolving credit facility in the united kingdom  both of which expire in december as of september   there was approximately million borrowed under these lines of credit

this amendment also increases the applicable interest rate by to basis points 
the amendment also raised the baseline amount for the minimum tangible net worth covenant to million from million 
additionally  this amendment extends the expiration of the amended credit agreement by one year  to december  
table of contents operating activities during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted as accounts receivable and inventories increased due to higher volume as a result of demand for our products and services 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
in all years  cash was principally used to fund growth in accounts receivable  inventories and costs related to projects which could not be billed under the contract terms 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of our capital expenditures were used to continue the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system erp system  and the expansion of two of our operating facilities 
we incurred approximately million in fiscal at our electrical power products operations and million in fiscal  related to the implementation of the erp system 
the majority of our capital investments were used to improve our capabilities to manufacture switchgear and electrical power control rooms  as well as investments in the erp system mentioned above 
in  investing activities included cash expenditures of million for the acquisition of the power vac product line from ge which does not include the total million purchase price payable over months and million for the acquisition of the services business in louisiana previously described 
there were no proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal proceeds from the sale of fixed assets provided cash of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal and were primarily from the sale of idled manufacturing facilities and equipment 
there were no net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities in fiscal or net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities were million in fiscal marketable securities were sold to finance working capital requirements of the business in fiscal financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal the primary source of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to borrowings on the us revolving line of credit  which is used to fund operations and capital expenditures and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal the primary use of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to payments on the us revolving line of credit 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal was proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
long term capital operating as of september  debt lease lease payments due by period obligations obligations obligations total less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations 
table of contents other commercial commitments the following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event in thousands as of september   letters of payments due by period credit less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of september   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
we also had performance and maintenance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at september  performance and maintenance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook for fiscal our backlog of orders going into fiscal is approximately million  a million increase over the beginning backlog of orders going into fiscal backlog growth has been driven by strong market demand in petrochemical  utility and transportation markets 
additionally  our recent acquisitions have strengthened our strategic position in the electrical power products market and expanded our product offering in the utility  industrial and commercial markets 
we have enhanced our capabilities with the addition of medium and low voltage iec switchgear  intelligent motor control systems and power distribution solutions 
the acquired power vac switchgear product line has a large installed base and a broad customer support across utility  industrial and commercial markets 
these recent acquisitions provide us with a significantly broader product portfolio and have enhanced our capabilities to meet market demands around the world 
we believe that our expanded product portfolio and new channels to new markets have strengthened us in our electrical power products business and positioned us for continued growth 
growth in demand for energy is expected to continue over the long term 
new infrastructure investments will be needed to ensure the available supply of petroleum products 
new power generation and distribution infrastructure will also be needed to meet the growing demand for electrical energy 
new power generation plants will also be needed to replace the aging facilities across the united states  as those plants reach the end of their life cycle 
a heightened concern for environmental damage  together with the uncertainty of gasoline prices  has expanded the popularity of urban transit systems and pushed ridership to an all time high  which will drive new investment in transit infrastructure 
opportunities for future projects continue  however  the timing of many of these projects is difficult to predict 
the current worldwide financial crises have reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many industrial business operations worldwide 
recent financial market conditions have significantly increased the volatility of currency and commodity markets 
this uncertainty may defer or delay commitments for new infrastructure projects that are in our opportunity pipeline 
the investment in working capital needed to produce our backlog varies and is impacted by the type of projects and the billing and payment terms on each project 
the increase in volume over the last three years has increased our investment in working capital 
as projects are completed and customer payments are received  cash flow from the projects is recovered 
while we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing revolvers should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future  the current financial crises could have an adverse effect on our business 
we will continue to actively monitor the collection of accounts receivable and investments in inventories to enhance our operating cash flow 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets  and ongoing threats to other financial institutions  us legislation was enacted for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets 
since 
table of contents enactment of the legislation  the capital markets have continued to experience extreme volatility and the credit markets have not yet shown any significant increase in the availability of credit 
there can be no assurance what impact this legislation ultimately will have on financial markets 
if actions taken to provide stabilization to the financial markets and increasing availability of credit are unsuccessful  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation we have experienced significant price volatility related to raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel  during the past three years 
fixed price contracts can limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
we anticipate that the volatility in commodity prices could impact our operations in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as provided by the american institute for certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed primarily based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance 
table of contents is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the review for impairment of these long lived assets takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but instead requires a test for impairment to be performed annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that an impairment could exist 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
warranty costs we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical rates applicable to individual product lines 
in addition  specific provisions are made when the costs of such warranties are expected to exceed accruals 
we use past experience and historical claims to determine the estimated liability 
actual results could differ from our estimate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of september   because we believe that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on october  
table of contents fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the positions 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
hedging activities sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  requires that each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability and measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income loss from continuing operations or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether the derivative qualifies for fair value or cash flow accounting treatment 
at september   we had no derivative instruments in place

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
at september   million was outstanding  bearing interest at approximately per year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of approximately  while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the euro 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars and a portion of our credit facility is payable in british pound sterling 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract by contract basis to avoid a negative effect on profit margin 
while we may do so in the future  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity risk in fiscal we continue to experience price volatility with some of our key raw materials and components 
fixed price contracts may limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
fluctuations in commodity prices may have a material impact on our future earnings and cash flows 
market risk we are also exposed to general market and other risk and its potential impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if our customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions 
our customers are typically oil and gas producers  oil and gas pipelines  refineries  petrochemical plants  electrical power generators  public and private utilities  co generation facilities  mining metals  pulp and paper plants  transportation systems  governmental agencies and other large industrial customers 
we maintain on going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to payment status  change orders and billing terms in an effort to monitor collections of amounts billed
