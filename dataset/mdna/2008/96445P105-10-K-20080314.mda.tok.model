critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period

net assets of collateralized financings during through  uac securitization corporation uacsc  a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of uac  purchased receivables from off balance sheet securitizations that were eligible for clean up calls 
these receivables were re securitized through non recourse collateralized financing issuances 
the associated future cash flows from these receivables were subject to the same master trust account provisions as the securitizations called 
to finance the securitized receivable acquisitions  collateralized financings were used  secured by the respective portfolios of the acquired receivables and related restricted cash accounts 
timely payments of principal and interest on the non recourse collateralized financings were insured by surety policies 
such obligations were also cross collateralized through the master trust agreement 
net interest cash flows in excess of expense were payable to the master trust account and expensed as charge to master trust  net 
on december   uac prepaid in full the collateralized financing debt of the securitized finance receivables using cash collateral of the individual securitizations and cash in the master trust account 
upon completion of the prepayment of this debt  the securitization agreements and the master trust account agreement were terminated and the receivable collateral is now owned outright by uacsc 
valuation of beneficial interest in master trust the master trust agreement established that all excess cash from securitizations was to be deposited in the master trust account 
once prescribed cash reserve levels were met  cash would be released to uac from the master trust account 
this future cash flow was reported as beneficial interest in master trust 
in determining the fair value of the beneficial interest in master trust  estimates were made for the future prepayments  rates of gross credit losses and credit loss severity  and delinquencies as they impacted the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows from the master trust 
the average of the interest rates on the receivables exceeded the interest rates on the securities issued in the securitization 
this excess cash was held by the master trust account and released based on reserve requirements of the master trust 
these estimated cash flows from the master trust were then discounted to reflect the present value 
with the prepayment of the collateralized financing debt and the subsequent termination of the securitization agreements and the master trust account agreement  these cash restrictions are no longer in effect 
allowance for loan losses finance receivables provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
the allowance for loan losses is established systematically by management based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
coastal credit reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date 
assumptions regarding credit losses are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumptions increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations 
coastal credit believes that the existing allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb inherent finance receivable losses 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on white river s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and their ability to not allow an ownership change to occur for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance has been derived pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and reduces the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized see note 
on august   white river acquired coastal credit  an established  profitable operating business within uac s historical line of business 
with this acquisition  it is now likely that some of the deferred tax assts will be realized by white river 
as part of the acquisition purchase accounting  the taxable income of coastal credit was estimated and partially offset by the taxable loss of uac and corporate expenses of white river for the remainder of tax year and the following five years 
the results of these estimates were a reduction in the valuation allowance of million at august  this adjustment to the valuation allowance was offset by a reduction to goodwill as part of the purchase of coastal credit 
during white river continued to evaluate its future taxable income based on the successful integration of coastal credit and various other events that occurred during as a result of this evaluation  white river determined that it is more likely than not that the federal deferred tax assets will be realized resulting in the reversal of the corresponding valuation allowance 
the reversal of the valuation allowance for the federal and state net operating loss carryforward contributed to the income tax benefit of million for the twelve months ended december  white river reviews the valuation allowance based on the estimated taxable income and will make adjustments as required 
these future adjustments will be recorded as a component of income tax expense benefit 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in income from the prior year is primarily due to the following an income tax expense of million for compared to and income tax benefit of million for the income tax benefit for was primarily a result of the reversal of the majority of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  a decrease in accretion income from beneficial interest in master trust during  the near elimination of gain from deficiency sale and litigation settlement as a result of a lack of such transactions occurring during as compared to  a million increase in provision for estimated credit losses during discussion of results the following table presents consolidating financial information for white river for the periods indicated for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin deficit after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other revenues expenses income loss before income taxes for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin deficit after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other revenues expenses income before income taxes the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated interest on receivables decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest on receivables increased million due to a larger average finance receivable balance of million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  interest on receivables from uac declined million due to a decline in the average receivable balance to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  from the liquidation of securitization receivables 
accretion and other interest decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result from a decrease in accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the balance of other comprehensive income has continued to decline as income is accreted 
this will result in the continued decline in future accretion income 
the individual components of accretion and other interest income are shown in the following table in thousands years ended december  uac discount accretion for beneficial interest in master trust interest on cash balances accretion and other interest income interest expense decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in average line of credit and subordinated debentures of million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
uac interest expense decreased by million due to the decrease in interest expense and accretion expense from the uac creditor notes payable that were acquired by white river and  to a greater extent  the decrease in the average collateralized financings of to million during the year ended december  from million during the same period ended december  interest expense of corporate and other was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in interest expense from the secured note payable that was paid in full on october  provision for estimated credit losses was million compared to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for estimated credit losses is charged to income to bring coastal credit s allowance for estimated credit losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
for coastal credit  the provision for estimated credit losses was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit has seen increases in delinquency rates in the latter half of as a result of this delinquency  coastal credit s net charge offs increased during the fourth quarter  but day delinquency decreased to at december  compared to at september  in addition  coastal credit increased its allowance reserves to of receivables  net of unearned income  during the forth quarter this activity resulted in the increase of coastal credit s provision for estimated credit losses 
uac recorded recovery for estimated credit losses of million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change in recovery for estimated credit losses is a result of declining defaulted receivables during the charge to master trust  net was a million charge for the year ended december  compared to a million credit for the year ended december  charge to master trust is expense related to future transfers of funds to the master trust from securitized finance receivables of uac 
the million decrease in charge to master trust is related to the sale of deficiency receivables  the sale of receivables that filed for chapter bankrupt protection  and settlement proceeds recorded as other income during compared to only a small sale of deficiency receivables during with the clean up call of all securitizations on december  and termination of the master trust agreement  there will be no future charge to master trust  net activity 
loss from extinguishment of debt was million for the year ended december  the loss during is related to the settlement distribution white river paid to uac creditors who sold their general unsecured claims and subordinated notes during there was no activity during gain from deficiency sale and litigation settlement was  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this gain is the result of the sale of receivables that filed chapter bankruptcy protection  and the funds received from a legal settlement during and the uac sale of deficiency receivables during and other income expense was an expense of million compared to an income of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other income is primarily the result of refunds of dealer rebates from charged off and prepaid finance contracts and collections of previously charged off balances net of expenses 
salaries and benefits decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit contributed million to this decrease 
there was no significant change in salaries and benefits for uac and corporate and other during these periods 
operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit operating expenses remained relatively unchanged between these periods 
uac operating expenses decreased million as a result of the continued liquidation of its assets 
corporate and other operating expenses increased million between these periods 
these corporate and other expenses were primarily professional fees 
third party servicing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  uac is the only segment that incurs this expense 
this decrease is the result of the ongoing liquidation of the uac receivable portfolio during uac pays a monthly servicing fee per active receivable 
as the number of receivables decreased as the result of the liquidation of receivables  the third party servicing expenses decreased 
bankruptcy costs are professional fees and expenses associated with the bankruptcy proceedings of uac 
these costs were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
uac is the only segment that incurs these costs which were for the purpose of assisting the reorganized company in complying with its bankruptcy plan 
future bankruptcy costs were eliminated with the closure of the bankruptcy case on january  income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  prior to  any income tax provision benefit in the year was offset by an increase decrease in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of december   white river had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million 
net operating losses may be carried forward up to years for federal income tax purposes 
white river s earliest net operating losses available for carryforward were generated in the tax year ended june   and will expire if not used prior to the tax year ending december  with the acquisition of coastal credit on august   white river acquired a historically profitable subsidiary that enabled white river to recognize a portion of the net operating loss nol carryforwards 
during white river continued to evaluate its future taxable income based on the successful integration of coastal credit and various other items that occurred during this evaluation determined that it is more likely than not that the federal deferred tax assets will be realized resulting in the reversal of the corresponding valuation allowance 
the reversal of the valuation allowance for the federal and state net operating loss carryforward contributed to the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the availability of these tax benefits would be jeopardized if an ownership change as defined in irs regulations governing nol carryforward limitations were to occur in the future with respect to white river 
in general  an ownership change occurs when  as of any testing date  the aggregate of the increase in percentage points of the total amount of a corporation s stock owned by each percent shareholder within the meaning of the nol carryforward limitations whose percentage ownership of the stock has increased as of such date over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by each such percent shareholder at any time during the three year period preceding such date  is more than percentage points 
in general  persons who own or more of a corporation s stock are percent shareholders  and all other persons who own less than of a corporation s stock are treated together  as a single  public group percent shareholder  regardless of whether they own an aggregate of of a corporation s stock 
calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to inherent uncertainty 
this uncertainty results from the complexity and ambiguity of the nol carryforward limitations as well as the limitations on the knowledge of a publicly traded corporation concerning the ownership of  and transactions in  its securities 
white river is not aware of any facts indicating that an ownership change has occurred with respect to white river 
financial condition as of december  and securitized finance receivables  net securitized finance receivables  net were million at december  on december   uac prepaid in full the collateralized financing debt of the securitized finance receivables using cash collateral of the individual securitizations and cash in the master trust account 
upon completion of the prepayment of this debt  the securitization agreements and the master trust account agreement were terminated and the receivable collateral is now owned  outright  by uac

uac finance receivables  net increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  coastal credit finance receivables  net increased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a significant number of contracts acquired by coastal credit are contracts made with borrowers who are in the united states military 
as of december   of the coastal credit receivables were with borrowers who are in the united state military as compared to as of december  coastal credit believes that having in the portfolio a significant percentage of contracts for which the borrowers are united states military personnel contributes to lower payment delinquency and greater collection personnel efficiencies 
coastal credit requests that all borrowers who are in the military use the military allotment system to make payments on their contracts 
under this allotment system  the borrower authorizes the military to make a payroll deduction for the amount of the borrower s monthly contract payment and to direct this deduction payment to coastal credit on behalf of the borrower 
delinquency of payments on contracts paid by allotment historically has been less than delinquency of payments on contracts not paid by allotment 
as a result  the collection effort associated with the military contracts requires substantially less time  allowing coastal credit s collection staff to focus on an increasing number of non military contracts 
throughout  the percentage of contracts made with borrowers who are in the united states military has declined due to the deployment of troops abroad 
until these deployments are reduced  it is likely that coastal credit will continue to see a decline in contracts with military personnel 
as of december   coastal credit s finance receivables consisted exclusively of contracts acquired by coastal credit without credit recourse to the dealer 
although all the contracts in coastal credit s portfolio were acquired without credit recourse  each dealer remains liable to coastal credit for liabilities arising from certain representations and warranties made by the dealer with respect to compliance with applicable federal and state laws and valid title to the vehicle 
coastal credit s policy is to only acquire a contract after the dealer has provided coastal credit with the requisite proof that coastal credit will have a first priority lien on the financed vehicle  that the borrower has obtained the required collision insurance naming coastal credit as loss payee and that the contract has been fully and accurately completed and validly executed 
coastal credit typically buys contracts on an individual basis and occasionally considers portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
beneficial interest in master trust beneficial interest in master trust was million at december  uac used a discount rate to value the beneficial interest in master trust as of december  on december   uac prepaid in full the collateralized financing debt of the securitized finance receivables using cash collateral of the individual securitizations and cash in the master trust account

upon completion of the prepayment of this debt  the securitization agreements and the master trust account agreement were terminated 
collateralized financings were million at december accrued interest payable accrued interest payable was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of i the prepayment in full of the secured note payable on october   ii the prepayment in full the collateralized financing debt of the securitized finance receivables on december  and iii the elimination of accrued interest payable for creditor notes payable as a result of the early adoption of sfas no

 the fair value opinion for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

any accrued interest as a result of interest expense from creditor notes payable is included in the fair market valuation of creditor notes payable 
creditor notes payable creditor notes payable was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was the result of continued repayment of principal in accordance with the uac bankruptcy plan

liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the cash sent to the master trust account in accordance with the master trust agreement of uac partially offset by a reduction of interest expense as a result of a lower average line of credit balance for as compared to and the prepayment of the secured note payable and subordinated debentures during net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of a reduction in the principal collection and recoveries on securitized finance receivables 
in addition  the purchases of finance receivables declined during as a result in a reduction of the number of loans acquired by coastal credit during   as compared to   this activity was partially offset by the collection on beneficial interest in master trust 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this change is primarily the result of a decline in the principal payments on collateralized financings as they continued to liquidate during compared to partially offset by the prepayment of the secured note payable and subordinated debentures during at december   white river and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december coastal credit has a revolving credit facility from a lending institution with a maximum borrowing limit of million 
this facility increased from million during july the maturity date on the line of credit was extended to december  effective january  and the interest rate was reduced to the london interbank offered rate libor plus from libor plus 
as of december   coastal credit had million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility as compared to million as of december  there was million and million available in excess of the amount utilized at december  and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of coastal credit 
in addition  white river has provided an unconditional corporate guaranty 
coastal credit must maintain specified financial ratios within guidelines established by the lender

in the event of a significant pay down or an earlier retirement of the revolver commitment  coastal credit would sustain certain prepayment penalties 
this facility limits distributions coastal credit may make to white river to of coastal credit s net income in addition to permitted payments on subordinated debt including white river debt guaranteed by coastal credit 
coastal credit prepaid in full its subordinated debentures during april and may coastal credit had million of subordinated debentures outstanding at december  interest on the debentures was payable quarterly at a fixed rate of interest of per annum 
at december   approximately of the holders of subordinated debentures were related parties 
uac s sources of liquidity are limited and consist of cash on hand  escrowed cash for operations  funds from consolidated operations and cash collections of the liquidating finance receivables 
white river  as owner of the substantial majority of uac s notes and claims outstanding under the plan of reorganization  is entitled to distribution of the substantial majority of these cash flows as they are realized by uac 
however  the realization of such projected cash flows is dependent upon the performance of the underlying auto receivable portfolios and the effective servicing of such receivables 
in particular  if gross defaults  recoveries on defaulted receivables or prepayments on such receivables are less favorable than the rates projected by management  uac s realization of such cash flows will be reduced or delayed relative to such projections 
such reduction may be material
