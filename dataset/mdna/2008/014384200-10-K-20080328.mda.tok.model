item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a the company s md a is comprised of significant accounting estimates made in the normal course of its operations  overview of the company s business conditions  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations 
the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or the company s significant accounting estimates identified are  revenue recognition  accounts receivables and inventory valuation 
the company is disclosing segment information for two segments 
the company has historically considered its operations to be comprised of one business segment 
however  due to the significance of its external sales of prepreg in the first quarter of  a trend which management believes will continue  the company believes its business to be comprised of two operating segments  composite products and composite materials 
the company began reporting two segments for the first quarter of composite products is comprised sales of golf shafts  hockey sticks and other composite products 
composite materials is comprised of external sales of prepreg products in the forms of uni tapes  fabrics and film adhesives along with contributions from its interest in cft 
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies  which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer certain of our customers the right to return shafts for breakage within a limited time after delivery 
we track such shaft breakage returns  and we record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns at the time sales are made 
the company believes that any shafts returned for breakage will be returned within three years of the initial sale of the shaft 
the company estimates in regards to total actual returns  that will be returned in the first year after sale  in the second year after sale and the remaining in the third year after sale  assuming a mid year convention 
the company s breakage return rate has been between and breakage returns divided by sales dollars for the past ten years 
the company has historically utilized a four year moving average of the breakage return rate to record its estimated liability 
the four year average utilized in the accrual estimate as of december  is 
the company s breakage return rate has declined over the past years 
the highest four year average over the past ten years has been 
if the company were to use in estimating its liability as of december   it would have the effect of increasing the liability by approximately  which would be recorded in cost of goods sold 
while breakage returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  by reviewing all amounts owed to the company and focusing on those amounts that are greater than days past due 
the company reviews the customers that have amounts greater than days past due and where appropriate  establishes a reserve for the receivable amount that company deems to be at risk in collecting 
as of december   the company estimated this amount to be approximately  if the company were to reserve for the total amount greater than days past due  it would increase the allowance by approximately  which would be recorded in administrative expense 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
management of the company  including but not limited to  representatives from manufacturing  sales  accounting and officers review the inventory reserve methodology quarterly and when appropriate  establish additional reserves or reduce existing reserves 
the company s reserve methodology consists of the following reviewing on hand inventories of all of its finished goods shafts and comparing inventories to historical sales trends and anticipated sales forecasts 
a reserve is established for all shafts that are deemed to be obsolete 
in some cases a reserve of or may be established to discount the product to its estimated realizable value 
raw materials are reviewed based upon estimated future production and when appropriate  reserves are established 
shafts that are designated for rework parts that need additional work are reviewed and when appropriate reserves are established 
the final analysis is to review inactive inventory  and apply reserves to parts that were not included in the other analyses and have been inactive in the system for a period of twelve months 
the company s average reserve percentage compared to gross inventory has been approximately for the past five years 
in the past five years  the highest reserve percentage was approximately and the lowest reserve percentage was approximately 
the company s reserve percentage as of december  is 
see the estimated impact below to cost of goods sold  utilizing the different reserve rates above amounts below in thousands highest average lowest gross inventory as of    reserve rate estimated reserve    recorded reserve as of    impact to costs of goods sold  in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure that our forecasts of future product demands are reasonable  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
the company continues to look at ways of minimizing its inventory levels and to be more efficient 
as the company continues to try to reduce its carrying levels of its work in process and finished goods inventory  it should have the effect of further reducing the amount of its inventory reserves 
overview business conditions composite products the composite products segment is mainly comprised of graphite golf shafts and  to a lesser extent  hockey sticks  see discussion below regarding the company s decision to exit the hockey business 
the graphite shaft market consists of customized oem production shafts  both premium and value and aldila branded and co branded shafts 
the company sells customized oem production and co branded shafts directly to its oem customers and sells aldila branded shafts through the oem custom stock and custom fit programs and to distributors 
the company has re emerged over the past couple of years as an innovator in the branded segment of the business  in which shafts tend to sell at higher prices and have higher gross margins than the customized oem production shafts sold to club manufacturers 
the company introduced the aldila nv in  featuring the company s exclusive micro laminate technology 
the nv has had numerous tour victories 
the company introduced nv line extensions in  including the nvs  nv protopype  pink nv  nv irons and nv hybrid shafts 
the company began shipping its newest shaft offering the vs proto and the vs proto hybrid in the vs proto was used by the winner of the us open and is quickly becoming aldila s single most popular shaft model on tour 
the vs proto is a high performance shaft featuring carbon nanotubes as well as aerospace carbon fibers and aldila s exclusive high performance resin system 
in addition  the company unveiled the new vs proto hybrid shaft for high end hybrid clubs 
aldila has enjoyed tremendous success on tour over the last two years 
in  pga  lpga and nationwide tour professionals using aldila shafts won a total of tour events 
during the season  tour professionals using aldila shafts won events on the pga tour and nearly fifty percent of all the events on the nationwide tour 
the recently introduced aldila dvs  along with the vs proto and the nv  continue to be among the leading wood and hybrid shaft series on the pga and nationwide tours 
aldila shafts were also the most popular shafts for woods and hybrid clubs at every major championship on the pga tour in aldila shafts were used by the winner of the masters and the us open as well as the winner of the world golf championship accenture match play championship  three of the year s first limited field events for the world s top players 
aldila staff member  paula creamer won the sbs open and led the us women s team to victory in the solheim cup playing her pink nv woods 
aldila was also the shaft of choice for the majority of players in both woods and hybrids at the pga club professional championship 
leading amateurs are also using aldila shafts more than any other graphite shaft brand 
at the us men s amateur  aldila was the leading shaft choice for hybrids 
during the us public links championship  aldila was the most popular wood and hybrid shaft 
aldila was also the leading shaft at the ncaa division men s championship in both woods and hybrids and the leading driver shaft at the ncaa women s championship 
in  aldila shafts were included on the golf digest hot list and won golf tips magazine s technology award 
aldila hybrid shafts achieved the highest test score for the golf magazine club test 
forty club testers evaluated hybrid clubs for golf magazine and clubs featuring aldila hybrid shafts received the highest rating in every category for hybrid clubs 
overall  the aldila shafts helped give the testers the best feel  playability  forgiveness and distance with their hybrids compared to the competition 
the company believes that it will continue to be successful in the branded segment and has focused its marketing and advertising effort in support of this business 
the company tries to maintain a broad customer base in both the oem production shaft and branded shaft market segments and competes aggressively with foreign based shaft manufacturers for oem production shafts and branded shafts 
however  the company s sales have tended to be concentrated among a limited number of major club companies  thus making the company s results of operations dependent on those customers  their continued willingness to purchase a significant portion of their shafts from the company  and their success in selling clubs containing the company s shafts to their customers 
in  net sales to acushnet company  ping and callaway golf  represented  and of the company s net sales  respectively  and the company anticipates that these companies will continue  collectively  to represent the largest portion of its sales in although it is generally difficult to predict in advance the success of any particular club or of any particular manufacturer  the company believes that it is protected to some extent from normal periodic fluctuations in sales among the various golf club companies by virtue of the broad depth and range of its customer base 
golf club companies regularly introduce new clubs  frequently containing innovations in design 
sometimes these new clubs achieve dramatic success in the marketplace  thus increasing the overall volatility of club sales among the major companies 
while the company seeks to have its shafts represented on as many major product introductions as possible  it can provide no assurance that its shafts will be included in any particular hot club or that sales of a hot club that does not include the company s shafts will not have a negative impact on the sales of those clubs that do 
the company s sales could also suffer a significant drop off from period to period to the extent that they may be dependent in any period on sales of one or more hot clubs  which then tail off in subsequent periods and at the same time  new offerings fail to achieve a high level of new sales sufficient to exceed or replace the previous sales levels of hot clubs 
during the s  the graphite golf shaft industry became increasingly competitive  placing extraordinary pressure on the selling prices of the company s golf shafts and adversely affecting its gross profit margins and level of profitability 
the company s average selling price decreased by from december  through december  the pressure was mainly attributed to the increased competition for oem production shafts  and a shift of our customers away from branded shafts to customized oem production shafts 
beginning in  the company was able to achieve higher average selling prices as it enjoyed increasing success in the branded segment of the business 
in late  the company began to offer its oem customers co branded shafts for their stock offerings 
the introduction of co branded shafts and the continued success in the branded segment had the effect of increasing the company s average selling prices over prior years 
the company s average selling price increased by approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable period in however  the company s average selling price decreased by for the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period in as the company s branded and co branded shafts typically sell at higher selling prices than oem production shafts  a significant change in product mix in any one period will have the effect of increasing or decreasing the average selling price of shafts sold 
in addition  increases in carbon fiber prices passed on to its customers could also have the effect of increasing average selling prices in the future 
the company s response to the pricing pressure it faced during the s  and continues to face in the oem production shaft segment  has been to vertically integrate  reduce its cost structure and to focus on continued penetration of the branded and co branded shaft segments 
the vertical integration began in when the company started manufacturing prepreg  the principal raw material in the manufacture of graphite golf shafts  at its facility in poway  california 
see composite materials 
in addition to the company s efforts to reduce its costs through vertical integration  the company also reduced its cost structure by shifting more of its shaft production to lower cost labor markets  such as mexico  china and in  vietnam 
in addition to golf shafts  the company also manufactured hockey sticks for one customer 
the company began manufacturing and selling hockey sticks in the company had not seen a significant increase in sales of hockey sticks and was not satisfied with the status of its hockey business during the current year and as such  discontinued this product line in the second quarter of the decision to exit this product line has not had a material impact on the company s earnings and allows the company to focus on its more profitable product lines and businesses 
composite materials the composite materials segment is comprised of external sales of prepreg  film adhesives  fabrics and other materials and the contribution provided by the company s owned interest in cft 
the company sold its interest in cft to sgl on november  as such  the composite materials segment will not benefit from future contribution from cft 
the company historically has not tracked inter segment sales and has always looked at the contribution provided by composite materials based upon the external sales of materials 
the company records all shared costs to composite products and allocates certain costs for segment reporting  such as shipping  purchasing and other administrative costs based upon the net revenues of each segment 
costs that are specific to one segment are charged directly to the respective segment 
the company began to manufacture composite materials in initially  the prepreg produced was mainly consumed by the composite products segment 
the company s external sales of prepreg and other materials have increased over the past several years 
sales of prepreg as a percentage of net sales were for versus for the company has spent a significant amount of money over the past several years to increase the capacity of its prepreg operations in support of its external sales of prepreg and composite products operations 
in the second half of  the company purchased a second resin filmer 
the addition of a second resin filmer provides additional supply of resin film  which is one of the key raw materials in the production of prepreg 
the increase in resin film capacity has enabled the company to add additional capacity to the company s prepreg composite manufacturing operations as well as provide increased capacity for film products 
in addition  it provides capacity protection should the company encounter problems with its other resin filmer 
the company completed the installation of its sixth prepreg tape line in late  which enables it to support anticipated growth for shaft and prepreg sales 
in addition  the company installed a wide tape line during the fourth quarter of and that has become operational during the first quarter of this will add further capacity to support anticipated growth in this business segment 
the company continues to look for opportunities to sell its prepreg and film adhesive products to other fabricators of products manufactured from composite materials 
the company has achieved some success in these areas and management believes that growth opportunities in these areas will continue to exist 
in addition  management believes that vertical integration through its prepreg operation has been successful to date and is allowing the company to maintain  or in some cases enhance  its competitive position with respect to the major united states golf club companies that are its principal customers 
in addition to vertical integration through prepreg  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber in  which is a significant raw material used in the prepreg production process 
during and through the first ten months of  the company used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of prepreg used for graphite shaft production 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl carbon fibers and composites  inc sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
on november   sgl purchased the remaining of cft from the company 
as part of the sale  the company signed a five year supply agreement with cft  which allows the company to purchase up to  pounds of carbon fiber in year and  pounds of carbon fiber in years results of operations compared to net sales chg chg composite products    composite materials    total net sales    net sales decreased by million for from the decrease in sales was attributed to a decrease in composite product sales  which were partially offset by an increase in composite materials sales 
the company s average selling price of golf shafts decreased by for and overall units declined by for as compared to the decrease in composite products sales were attributed to decreases in sales of branded and oem shafts  while co branded shaft sales remained relatively flat for as compared to branded golf shaft sales declined by and oem golf shaft sales declined by 
branded and co branded golf shaft sales declined to of composite products sales in from in the decreases in branded shaft sales were attributed to a relatively weak demand of driver club units  which represent the best opportunities for branded shaft products 
the company has seen increased competition in this segment of shafts 
although  the company s branded shaft sales have decreased year over year  the company s branded shafts are still performing well on the professional golf tours  indicated by the fact  that the company won the shaft count at this years four major golf championships 
in addition to the decreases in shaft sales  sales of composite hockey sticks decreased by for as compared to the company discontinued the manufacture of composite hockey sticks during the second quarter of and exited that product line 
composite materials sales increased by million  or a increase 
composite materials have increased to approximately of the company s consolidated net revenues 
the company believes that these sales will continue to increase and has completed the installation of a wide prepreg tape line in the fourth quarter of  which will be operational towards the end of the first quarter of to support this anticipated growth
