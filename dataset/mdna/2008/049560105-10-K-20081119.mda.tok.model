item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements  the impact of recent economic conditions on our customers  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  regulatory trends and decisions  including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in texas  adverse weather conditions  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas  the capital intensive nature of our gas distribution business  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events  and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  especially those discussed in item a above  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered through rates 
discontinuing the application of sfas could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our natural gas distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities  which are subject to refund 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility company s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments  but they provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline  storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 
operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers 
operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes 
table of contents in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of natural gas sales to residential  commercial  industrial  municipal and other customers 
for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices  customer deposits and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
financial instruments and hedging activities we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk 
additionally  we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 
we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by sfas  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement 
we determine fair values primarily through prices actively quoted on national exchanges  which we believe correspond to the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 
we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value in those limited circumstances where external sources are not available 
values are adjusted accordingly to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
fair value estimates also consider the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short term capital markets  which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements in our natural gas marketing segment 
the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 
changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 
financial instruments associated with commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment  our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices 
we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage  fixed price forward contracts and financial instruments  primarily over the counter swap and option contracts  in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season 
the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a 
table of contents component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 
our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
we also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline  storage and other segment 
as a result of these activities  our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments  we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index  with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins 
we have elected to exclude this spot forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair value hedges 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
over time  we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
we have elected to treat fixed price forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales 
as such  these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges in accordance with sfas financial instruments associated with interest rate risk we periodically manage interest rate risk  typically when we issue new or refinance existing long term debt 
currently  we do not have any financial instruments in place to manage interest rate risk 
however  in prior years  we entered into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 
we designated these treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement was 
table of contents initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision 
we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long lived assets is at risk 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
through fiscal  we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june measurement date 
effective october   we changed our measurement date to september the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

table of contents we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year 
as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year 
typically  our accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline  as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills 
gas stored underground  particularly in our natural gas distribution segment  typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 
during the current year  prices for several world energy commodities rose to historic levels  most significantly seen in unprecedented oil prices 
while natural gas prices did not reach historic levels  they were impacted by financial speculators and large hedge fund trading  particularly during the summer months 
as a result  our natural gas distribution segment s cost of natural gas per mcf sold increased percent to for the current fiscal year compared with in the prior fiscal year 
despite these higher prices  we experienced lower price volatility  which reduced our natural gas marketing segment s opportunity to earn arbitrage gains 
although gas costs do not directly impact our natural gas distribution gross profit margin  higher natural gas prices could cause our natural gas distribution customers and customers served by our other operating segments to conserve  or in the case of industrial customers  switch to less expensive fuel sources 
further  higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
we normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our working capital needs and growth 
however  recent adverse developments in global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the short term capital markets  including the commercial paper market  to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
despite these conditions  we believe the amounts available to us under our credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital needs for fiscal year 
table of contents consolidated results the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september   and for the fiscal year ended september in thousands  except per share data operating revenues gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income earnings per diluted share historically  our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
regulated operations contributed percent  percent and percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years   and our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows for the fiscal year ended september in thousands natural gas distribution segment regulated transmission and storage segment natural gas marketing segment pipeline  storage and other segment net income the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations for the fiscal year ended september in thousands  except per share data regulated operations nonregulated operations consolidated net income diluted eps from regulated operations diluted eps from nonregulated operations consolidated diluted eps year over year  net income during fiscal increased seven percent 
net income from our regulated operations increased percent during fiscal the increase primarily reflects a net million increase in gross profit resulting from our ratemaking efforts  coupled with higher per unit transportation margins and an percent increase in consolidated throughput in our atmos pipeline texas division 
these increases were partially offset by a four percent increase in operating expenses 
net income in our nonregulated 
table of contents operations experienced a percent decline as less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our asset optimization margins 
however  higher delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized margins partially offset this decrease 
the percent year over year increase in net income during fiscal reflects improvements across all business segments 
results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas distribution segment  including the implementation of wna in our mid tex and louisiana divisions coupled with increased throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our north side loop project and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal the decrease in net income from our nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile natural gas market  which reduced delivered gas margins despite a percent increase in sales volumes 
however  our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization margins  primarily in the pipeline  storage and other segment 
other key financial and significant events for the fiscal year ended september  include the following for the fiscal year ended september   we generated million in operating cash flow compared with million for the fiscal year ended september   primarily reflecting the unfavorable timing of gas cost collections from our customers and cash payments to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
capital expenditures increased to million during the fiscal year ended september  from million in the prior year 
the increase primarily reflects an increase in compliance spending and main replacements in our mid tex division  spending in the natural gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading initiative and spending for two nonregulated growth projects 
we repaid million of long term debt during the fiscal year ended september  compared with a net reduction of long term debt of million during the prior year 
the decreased payments during the current year reflect regularly scheduled maturity payments compared with the prior fiscal year  which reflect the repayment of million of unsecured floating rate senior notes with million of net proceeds received from the issuance of ten year senior notes 
we maintained our capitalization ratio within our targeted range of to percent despite higher short term borrowings under our existing year credit facility to fund seasonal natural gas purchases at higher prices 
see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas 
the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup 
therefore  increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise 
table of contents fees and gross receipts taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
timing differences exist between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes 
the effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods of volatile gas prices  particularly in our mid tex division 
these timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net income  however  these amounts should offset over time with no permanent impact on net income 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
finally  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september  and are presented below

table of contents the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september  and the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 
for the fiscal year ended september change in thousands mid tex kentucky mid states louisiana west texas mississippi colorado kansas other total the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a million net increase in rates 
the net increase in rates primarily was attributable to the mid tex division which increased million as a result of its grip filing  the previous and current year mid tex rate cases and the absence of a one time grip refund that occurred in the prior year 
the current year also reflects million in rate increases in our kansas  kentucky  louisiana  tennessee and west texas service areas 
in addition  the prior year includes a million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not recur in the current year 
gross profit also increased approximately million from revenue related taxes primarily due to higher revenues  on which the tax is calculated  in the current year compared to the prior year 
this increase  partially offset by a million period over period increase in the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income  resulted in a million increase in operating income  when compared with the prior year 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income  increased by a net million 
the net increase was primarily reflected in our operation and maintenance expense  excluding the provision for doubtful accounts  which increased million compared with the prior year 
the increase principally reflects higher employee and administrative costs in addition to increased natural gas odorization and fuel costs attributable to higher commodity prices 
the increase in operation and maintenance expense also reflects the absence in the current year period of a nonrecurring million deferral of hurricane related operation and maintenance expenses in the prior year 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended september   which reflects our continued effective collection efforts  despite a percent rise in our average cost of gas per mcf sold 
as a result of these efforts  our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal operating expenses for the prior year also include a million noncash charge associated with the write off of software costs 
the decrease in operating expenses attributable to the lower provision for doubtful accounts and the absence of the prior year charge were offset by the aforementioned increase in franchise and gross receipt taxes 
miscellaneous income the increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the recognition of a million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division during the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents interest charges interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment decreased million due to lower average outstanding short term debt balances in the current year compared with the prior year 
regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of inventory on hand 
similar to our natural gas distribution segment  our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas 
however  natural gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve  which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline 
further  as the atmos pipeline texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our mid tex division  the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september  and are presented below 
for the fiscal year ended september change in thousands  unless otherwise noted mid tex division transportation third party transportation storage and park and lend services other gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income gross pipeline transportation volumes mmcf consolidated pipeline transportation volumes mmcf the million increase in gross profit primarily was attributable to a million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our and grip filings and an million increase from transportation volumes 
consolidated throughput increased percent primarily due to increased transportation in the barnett shale region of texas 
the improvement in gross profit also reflects increased service fees and per unit transportation margins due to favorable market conditions which contributed million 
new compression 
table of contents contracts and transportation capacity enhancements also contributed million 
in addition  sales of excess gas increased million compared to the prior year 
operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs 
natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through aem  which aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
to facilitate this process  we utilize proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments 
as a result  our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 
our asset optimization activities seek to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control 
we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 
we also seek to participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
through the use of transportation and storage services and financial instruments  we also seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
aem continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed 
therefore  aem may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time 
if aem elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas  it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments 
if aem elects to defer the withdrawal of gas  it will reset its financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and execute new financial instruments to offset the original financial instruments 
we use financial instruments  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities 
these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled 
once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled  the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 
aem also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities 
changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 

table of contents due to the nature of these operations  natural gas prices have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations 
within our delivered gas activities  higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
higher gas prices  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
within our asset optimization activities  higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment 
increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices  which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities 
however  increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september  and are presented below 
gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities  which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 
unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
generally  if the physical financial spread narrows  we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses 
if the physical financial spread widens  we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal year ended september change in thousands  unless otherwise noted realized margins delivered gas asset optimization unrealized margins gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income gross natural gas marketing sales volumes mmcf consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes mmcf net physical position bcf the million decrease in our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit primarily reflects a million decrease in realized asset optimization margins 
as a result of less volatile natural gas market conditions experienced during the current year  aem regularly deferred storage withdrawals and reset the 
table of contents associated financial instruments to increase the potential gross profit it could realize from its asset optimization activities in future periods 
as a result  aem recognized settlement losses without corresponding storage withdrawal gains during the current year 
additionally  aem experienced increased storage fees charged by third parties during the current year 
in the prior year  aem was able to recognize arbitrage gains as changes in its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans had a significantly smaller impact than in the current year 
the decrease in realized asset optimization margins was partially offset by a million increase in realized delivered gas margins 
the increase reflects both increased sales volumes and increased per unit margins 
gross sales volumes increased eight percent compared with the prior year 
the increase in sales volumes reflects the successful execution of our marketing strategies 
our per unit margin increased percent  which reflects increased basis gains on certain contracts coupled with improved marketing efforts 
excluding the impact of these basis gains  our per unit margins increased seven percent in the current year 
gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a million increase in unrealized margins attributable to a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices 
the change in unrealized margins also reflects the recognition of previously unrealized margins as a component of realized margins as a result of injecting and withdrawing gas and settling financial instruments as a part of aem s asset optimization activities 
operating expenses increased million primarily reflecting a million increase associated with property taxes coupled with a million increase in other administrative costs 
economic gross profit aem monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit  before associated storage fees  that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments 
this economic gross profit  combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement is referred to as the potential gross profit 
the following table presents aem s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit at september   and associated net net physical economic gross unrealized gain potential gross period ending position profit loss profit bcf in millions in millions in millions september  september  september  potential gross profit represents the increase in aem s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned 
this amount does not include storage and other operating expenses and increased income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount 
therefore  it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income 
there is no assurance that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 
we consider this measure a non gaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forward looking storage injection withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information 
this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone 
as of september   based upon aem s planned inventory withdrawal schedule and associated planned settlement of financial instruments  the economic gross profit was million 
this amount will be reduced by million of net unrealized gains recorded in the financial statements as of september  that will reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying financial instruments are settled 
therefore  the potential gross profit was million at september  
table of contents the economic gross profit is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot ensure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september  will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  our earnings could be adversely impacted 
assuming aem fully executes its plan in place on september   without encountering operational or other issues  we anticipate the majority of the potential gross profit as of september  will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal with the remainder recognized over the remaining months in fiscal pipeline  storage and other segment our pipeline  storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc aps  atmos energy services  llc aes and atmos power systems  inc  which are each wholly owned by aeh 
aps owns and operates a mile pipeline located in new orleans  louisiana 
this pipeline is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana and for aem 
however  it also provides limited third party transportation services 
aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana 
we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 
finally  beginning in fiscal  aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business 
as of september   these activities were limited in nature 
aps also engages in limited asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls 
most of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the company and have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 
generally  these arrangements require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements 
aes  through december   provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations  other than the mid tex division 
these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices 
effective january   our shared services function began providing these services to our natural gas distribution operations 
aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions  and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 
through atmos power systems  inc  we have constructed electric peaking power generating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 
results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and  similar to our natural gas marketing segment  volatility in the natural gas markets 
additionally  this segment s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities

the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in throughput and the impact of having wna coverage for more than percent of our residential 
table of contents and commercial customers  partially offset by an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs and lower irrigation margins discussed below 
the impact of higher throughput and greater wna coverage increased gross profit by million 
included in this amount was a million increase associated with the implementation of wna in our mid tex and louisiana divisions beginning with the winter heating season 
as a result of the mid tex rate case  our gas distribution gross profit increased by million compared to the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in mid tex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the transportation rates for certain customer classes 
the mid tex rate case also required the refund of million collected under grip  which reduced gross profit in the current year 
favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased gross profit by million  primarily due to an million increase in grip related recoveries and a million increase from our rate stabilization clause rsc filings in our louisiana service areas 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in gross profit associated with regulatory rulings in our tennessee  louisiana and virginia jurisdictions 
offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in revenue related taxes 
due to a significant decline in the cost of gas in the current year period compared with the prior year period  franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in gross profit decreased approximately million  however  franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes  other than income decreased million  which resulted in a million increase in operating income when compared with the prior year period 
natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs 
the remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in pass through surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were fully recovered by the end of fiscal and during fiscal operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income  and impairment of long lived assets  increased to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  operation and maintenance expense  excluding the provision for doubtful accounts  increased million  primarily due to increased employee and other administrative costs 
these increases include the personnel and other operating costs associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our pipeline  storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january  partially offsetting these increases was the deferral of million of operation and maintenance expense in our louisiana division resulting from the louisiana public service commission s ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal and in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease primarily was attributable to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices 
in the natural gas distribution segment  the average cost of natural gas for the fiscal year ended september  was per mcf  compared with per mcf for the year ended september  depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the fiscal year ended september  compared with the prior year period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service during fiscal additionally  the increase was partially attributable to the absence in the current year period of a million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in the prior year period arising from the mississippi public service commission s decision to allow certain deferred costs in our rate base 
operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  included a million noncash charge associated with the write off of costs for software that will no longer be used

liquidity and capital resources our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the liquidity needed to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs 
additionally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 
we normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our working capital needs and growth 
however  recent adverse developments in global financial and credit markets  including the recent failure of a major investment bank and the bailout of or merger between several large financial institutions  have made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the short term capital markets  including the commercial paper market  to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
consequently  as of september   we had borrowed million directly under our five year committed credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to fund most of our working capital 
until recently  our five year committed credit facility allowed us to borrow up to million 
however  one lender with a share of the commitments has ceased funding under the facility 
this has effectively limited the amount that we can borrow to approximately million 
the amounts borrowed under the credit facility have been primarily used to purchase large volumes of natural gas in preparation for the upcoming winter heating season 
although our natural gas marketing operations have not been impacted directly in a significant manner yet  continued disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect the availability of the uncommitted demand credit facility on which such operations substantially relies to conduct its business 
a significant reduction in such availability would mean that the company would need to provide extra liquidity to support the activities of our natural gas marketing business and other nonregulated businesses 
our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh 
we have historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a short term million committed credit facility that must be renewed annually 
there were no borrowings under this facility as of september  in october  we replaced this facility upon its termination with a new facility that will allow borrowings up to million and expires in october additionally  as more fully described in note  the borrowing costs under the new facility will be significantly higher than under the prior facility 
we believe the amounts available to us under our existing and new credit facilities coupled with operating cash flow will provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for our services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors 
cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income  working capital changes  particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 
for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  operating cash flows were million lower in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease primarily reflects an increase in cash required to collateralize risk management liabilities in our natural gas marketing segment  which reduced operating cash flow by million and the unfavorable timing of gas cost collections in our natural gas distribution segment  which reduced operating cash flow by million 
fiscal year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which increased operating cash flow by million 
additionally  improved management of our deferred gas costs balances increased operating cash flow by million 
finally  increased net income and other favorable working capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash flow 
partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in customer collections of million due to the decrease in the price of natural gas during the fiscal year 
fiscal year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices 
year over year  unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by million 
partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories million 
additionally  favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in margin accounts and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
cash flows from investing activities in recent fiscal years  a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects  our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a timely return on our investment 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in fiscal primarily reflects an increase in compliance spending and main replacements in our mid tex division  spending in the natural gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading initiative and spending for two nonregulated growth projects 
the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects  which were completed during the fiscal third quarter 
cash flows from financing activities for the fiscal years ended september  and  our financing activities provided million and million in cash compared with cash of million used for the fiscal year ended september  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows during the fiscal years ended september  and  we increased our borrowings under our short term facilities by million and million whereas during the fiscal year ended 
table of contents september  we repaid a net million under our short term facilities 
net borrowings under our short term facilities during fiscal and reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices 
we repaid million of long term debt during the fiscal year ended september   compared with million during the fiscal year ended september  and million during the fiscal year ended september  the increased payments during fiscal reflect the repayment of our million unsecured floating rate senior notes discussed below 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due the effective interest rate of this offering  inclusive of all debt issue costs  was percent 
after giving effect to the settlement of our million treasury lock agreement in june  the effective rate on these senior notes was reduced to percent 
we used the net proceeds of million  together with million of available cash  to repay our million unsecured floating rate senior notes  which were redeemed on july  in december  we sold million shares of common stock in an offering  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce our short term debt 
during the fiscal year ended september   we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and the increase in dividends paid over the prior year reflects the increase in our dividend rate from per share during fiscal to per share during fiscal  combined with a million increase in shares outstanding due to new share issuances under our various equity plans 
during the fiscal year ended september  we issued million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  we granted million shares of common stock under our long term incentive plan to directors  officers and other participants in the plan

these facilities included a five year million unsecured facility expiring december  a million unsecured day facility expiring october  and an million unsecured facility expiring march however  one lender with a share of the commitments under our million and million facilities has ceased funding under these facilities 
further  in october  we replaced our million facility at its termination with a new million unsecured day facility 
after giving effect to these changes  the amount available to us under our committed credit facilities was million 
as of september   we had no outstanding letters of credit under these facilities 

table of contents aem has an uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to million 
as of september   the amount available to us under this credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit  was million 
borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when and as needed basis at the discretion of the banks 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
however  we believe these credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  our fiscal capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
shelf registration on december   we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue  from time to time  up to million in new common stock and or debt securities available for issuance 
as of september   we had approximately million available for issuance under the registration statement 
due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement  we are permitted to issue a total of approximately million of equity securities and million of senior debt securities 
in addition  due to restrictions imposed by another state regulatory commission  if the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade from either standard poor s corporation bbb  moody s investors services  inc baa or fitch ratings  ltd 
bbb  our ability to issue any type of debt securities under the registration statement would be suspended until an investment grade rating from all three credit rating agencies was achieved 
credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors services  inc moody s and fitch ratings  ltd 
fitch 
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows s p moody s fitch unsecured senior long term debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f currently  with respect to our unsecured senior long term debt  s p maintains its positive outlook and fitch maintains its stable outlook 
moody s recently reaffirmed its stable outlook 
none of our ratings are currently under review 
however  a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies 
this would mean even more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
the highest investment grade credit rating for s p is aaa  moody s is aaa and fitch is aaa 
the lowest investment grade credit rating for s p is bbb  moody s is baa and fitch is bbb 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating 
there can be

our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
we intend to maintain our capitalization ratio in a target range of to percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets

aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and less than bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 

table of contents with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
risk management activities we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution  natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument 
substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices

the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
our total net periodic pension and other benefit costs remained relatively unchanged during the current year period when compared with the prior year period as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  were consistent with the prior year 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
at our june  measurement date  the interest rates were consistent with rates at our prior year measurement date  which resulted in no change to our percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal net periodic and post retirement cost 
in addition  our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at percent 
the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
in the period leading up to our june  measurement date  these interest rates were increasing  which resulted in a basis point increase in our discount rate used to determine our fiscal net periodic and post retirement cost to percent 
this increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses 
this favorable impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent  which has the effect of increasing our pension and postretirement benefit costs 

table of contents pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
during fiscal and fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million and million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees 
these contributions achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for plan years and during fiscal  we did not contribute to our pension plans 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal effective october   the company adopted the requirement under sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  that the measurement date used to determine our projected benefit and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement costs must correspond to a fiscal year end 
in accordance with the transition rules  the fiscal expense will be based upon market conditions as of september  as of september   interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates  which will impact our fiscal net periodic pension and postretirement costs  were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of june   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
accordingly  we increased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to 
we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at percent  despite the recent decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation 
although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined  the impact of this decline is mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost 
accordingly  asset gains and losses are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan  our largest funded plan 
accordingly  we expect our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in fiscal despite the recent decline in the fair value of the plans assets  we were not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal however  based upon market conditions subsequent to september   the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the pension protection act ppa  we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the plans in fiscal further  we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds 
however  we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions 
with respect to our postretirement medical plans  we anticipate contributing approximately million during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

table of contents recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
therefore  our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 
natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term 
table of contents interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during we also assess market risk for our fixed rate long term obligations 
we estimate market risk for our long term obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease  the fair value of our long term obligations would have increased by approximately million 
as of september   we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
