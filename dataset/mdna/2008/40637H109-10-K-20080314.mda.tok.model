item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risks related to our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products targeting the extracellular matrix for the drug delivery  oncology and dermatology markets 
our existing products and our products under development are based on intellectual property covering the family of human enzymes known as hyaluronidases 
hyaluronidases are enzymes proteins that break down hyaluronic acid which is a naturally occurring substance in the human body 
our technology is based on our proprietary recombinant human ph enzyme  or rhuph  a human synthetic version of hyaluronidase that degrades hyaluronic acid  a space filling  gel like substance that is a major component of tissues throughout the body  such as skin and bone 
the ph enzyme is a naturally occurring enzyme that digests hyaluronic acid to temporarily break down the gel  thereby facilitating the penetration and diffusion of other drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle 
it also degrades the cumulus matrix surrounding oocytes eggs facilitating in vitro fertilization  or ivf 
our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing the company  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking product development for our existing products and a limited number of product candidates 
we have two marketed products cumulase  a product used for ivf  and hylenex  a product 
table of contents used as an adjuvant to increase the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs and fluids 
currently  we have only limited revenue from the sales of cumulase and hylenex  in addition to revenues from collaborative agreements with baxter healthcare corporation  or baxter  and f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd and hoffmann la roche  inc  collectively roche 
revenues from product sales depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our product candidates 
all of our product candidates are in the research  pre clinical  or clinical stage 
it may be years  if ever  before we are able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to generate meaningful revenue from the sale of these product candidates 
we have incurred net operating losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we currently have an effective universal shelf registration statement which will permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of additional equity or debt securities 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock pursuant to this registration statement or in connection with other transactions  or even the potential for such sales through the exercise of currently outstanding warrants  could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
in the future  we may issue additional options  warrants or other derivative securities convertible into our common stock to fund the continued development of our product candidates and for other general corporate purposes 
current products and product candidates we have two marketed products and multiple product candidates targeting several indications in various stages of development 
the following table summarizes our lead clinical products and product candidates product indication brief description development status cumulase in vitro fertilization marketed hylenex agent for drug and fluid infusion marketed chemophase chemoadjuvant for superficial bladder cancer phase i iia enhanze technology agent for enhanced drug delivery phase i proprietary ph oncology  metabolism pre clinical proprietary non ph oncology  dermatology pre clinical cumulase is an ex vivo used outside the body formulation of rhuph to replace the bovine enzyme currently used for the preparation of oocytes prior to ivf during the process of intracytoplasmic sperm injection  in which the enzyme is an essential component 
we launched cumulase in the european union and the united states in june hylenex is a human recombinant formulation for rhuph to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids 
when injected under the skin or in the muscle  hyaluronidase can digest the hyaluronic acid gel  allowing for temporarily enhanced penetration and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids 
we received approval from the food and drug administration  or fda  for hylenex in december in february  we entered into an expanded collaboration agreement with baxter under which baxter fills and finishes hylenex and holds it for subsequent distribution 
chemophase  our lead oncology product candidate  is an investigative chemoadjuvant designed to enhance the transport of chemotherapeutic agents to tumor tissue  potentially increasing diffusion in tissues without affecting vascular permeability 
chemophase is being developed for potential use in the treatment of patients with superficial bladder cancer 
in april  we commenced patient enrollment in our chemophase phase i iia clinical trial 
in september  we completed enrollment in our phase i iia clinical trial 
enhanze tm technology  a proprietary drug enhancement system using rhuph  is our broader technology opportunity that can potentially lead to proprietary partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies 
we are currently seeking partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that market or develop drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the subcutaneous or intramuscular routes that could benefit from this technology 
in december  we signed our first enhanze technology partnership with roche 
in september  we signed our second enhanze technology partnership with baxter 

table of contents collaborative agreements roche agreement in december  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement the roche agreement with roche for enhanze technology 
under the terms of the roche agreement  roche obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph and up to thirteen roche target compounds resulting from the collaboration 
roche paid us million as an initial upfront license fee for the application of rhuph to three pre defined roche biologic targets 
pending the successful completion of a series of clinical  regulatory  and sales events  roche will pay us further milestones which could potentially reach a value of up to million 
in addition  roche will pay us royalties on product sales for these first three targets 
over the next ten years  roche will also have the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional ten targets to be identified by roche  provided that roche will be obligated to pay continuing exclusivity maintenance fees to us in order to maintain its exclusive development rights for these targets 
for each of the additional ten targets  roche may pay us further upfront and milestone payments of up to million per target  as well as royalties on product sales for each of these additional ten targets 
additionally  roche will obtain access to our expertise in developing and applying rhuph to roche targets 
in addition  in december  an affiliate of roche purchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate of approximately million 
baxter agreements in september  we entered into an enhanze technology license and collaboration agreement the gammagard license with baxter 
under the terms of the gammagard license  baxter obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with a current baxter product  gammagard liquid tm 
under the terms of the agreement  baxter made an initial upfront payment of million to us 
pending successful completion of a series of regulatory and sales milestones  baxter may make further milestone payments totaling million to us 
in addition  baxter will pay royalties on the sales  if any  of the products that result from the collaboration 
the gammagard license is applicable to both kit and co formulation combinations 
baxter will assume all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs under the gammagard license  while we will be responsible for the supply of the rhuph enzyme 
in addition  baxter has certain product development and commercialization obligations in major markets identified in the gammagard license 
in february  we amended certain agreements with baxter for hylenex and entered into a new agreement  collectively the baxter agreements  for kits and co formulations with rhuph under the terms of the baxter agreements  baxter paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of million and  pending the successful completion of a series of regulatory and sales events  baxter will make milestone payments to us which could potentially reach a value of up to million 
in addition  baxter will make payments to us based on the sales of products covered under the baxter agreements 
in february  baxter prepaid million of such product based payments in connection with the execution of the baxter agreements 
in january  baxter prepaid another million of such product based payments and is obligated to prepay million of additional product based payments on or prior to january  baxter will also now assume all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs of the products covered by the baxter agreements 
we will continue to supply baxter with the api for hylenex  and baxter will prepare  fill  finish and package hylenex and hold it for subsequent distribution 
in addition  baxter will obtain a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with baxter hydration fluids and generic small molecule drugs  with the exception of combinations with i bisphosphonates  as well as ii cytostatic and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents  the rights to which have been retained by us 
in addition  in february  an affiliate of baxter purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately million 
additionally  baxter will make product based payments on the sales  if any  of the products that result from the collaboration 
revenues revenues from product sales depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our products and product candidates 

table of contents revenues from license and collaboration agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
non refundable upfront fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreement  assuming we meet certain criteria 
royalty revenues from the sale of licensed products are recognized upon the sale of such products 
during and  we entered into the roche agreement  the baxter agreements and the gammagard license  which consist of non refundable upfront license fees  reimbursements of research and development services  various clinical  regulatory or sales milestones and future product based or royalty payments  as applicable 
due to our ongoing involvement obligations under the agreements  we recorded the non refundable upfront license fees as deferred revenues 
such revenues are being recognized over the terms of the underlying agreements 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  and freight costs associated with the sales of cumulase  and the api for hylenex 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  clinical trials  facility costs  and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates 
since our inception in through  we have incurred research and development expenses of million 
from through  approximately of our research and development expenses were associated with the research and development of our recombinant human ph enzyme used in our cumulase and hylenex products  and approximately of our research and development expenses were associated with the development of our chemophase product candidate 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining fda approval  our reliance on third parties  and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our chemophase product candidate for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially if we are able to advance our chemophase product candidate and our other product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success  and total costs vary widely 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing chemophase  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate and other market and regulatory developments 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  or if  our chemophase product candidate  or any of our other product candidates  will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our chemophase product candidate  or any of our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  accounting and legal fees  other professional services expenses  marketing expenses  as well as other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
we anticipate continued increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as our operations continue to expand 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable fees at the inception of the agreements  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales revenues from the sale of cumulase are recognized when the transfer of ownership occurs which is upon shipment to the distributors 
we are obligated to accept returns for product that does not meet product specifications 
historically  we have not had any product returns  therefore  no allowance for product returns has been established 
under the terms of the baxter agreements  we supply baxter the api for hylenex at our fully burdened cost plus a margin 
baxter fills and finishes hylenex and holds it for subsequent distribution  at which time we ensure it meets product specifications and release it as available for sale 
because of our continued involvement in the development and production process of hylenex  the earnings process is not considered to be complete 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and related product costs on the api for hylenex until the product is filled  finished  packaged and released 
in addition  we receive product based payments upon the sale of hylenex by baxter  in accordance with the terms of the baxter agreements 
product sales revenues are recognized as we earn such revenues based on baxter s shipments of hylenex to its distributors when such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
in february  baxter prepaid million of such product based payments which was deferred and is being recognized as earned 
in january  baxter prepaid another million of such product based payments and is obligated to prepay million of additional product based payments on or prior to january  revenues under collaborative agreements revenues from collaborative and licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
nonrefundable upfront payments  in which we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
in february  we entered into the baxter agreements which consist of nonrefundable upfront license fees  reimbursements of research and development services  various clinical  regulatory or sales milestones and product based payments 
due to our ongoing involvement obligations  the nonrefundable upfront license fee received in february under the baxter agreements was deferred and is being recognized over the term of the agreement 
in september  we entered 
table of contents into the gammagard license with baxter 
under the terms of that agreement  baxter made an initial upfront payment of million  which is being deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the fees are nonrefundable and our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
reimbursements of research and development services are recognized as revenue during the period in which the services are performed 
royalties to be received based on sales of licensed products by our collaborators incorporating our products are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements 
share based compensation we account for share based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which we adopted effective january   including the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab we use the fair value method to account for share based payments with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods were not revised for comparative purposes 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience and those of our peer group 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
clinical trial and contract research expenses research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations  and other vendors that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on 
table of contents contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates accordingly on a prospective basis 
in addition  we have several contracts that extend across multiple reporting periods  including our largest contract representing a million research contract for the management of a toxicology study 
we recognize expenses as the services are provided pursuant to management s assessment of the progress that has been made to date 
such contracts require an assessment of the work that has been completed during the period  including measurement of progress  analysis of data that justifies the progress and management s judgment 
based on our experience and management s intimate involvement with these outsourced contracts  it is reasonably likely that we may experience a variance in our estimate of the work completed 
a variance in our estimate of the work completed in our largest contract could increase or decrease our operating expenses by approximately  which would not represent a material change to historically reported results of operations 
inventory inventory consists of our cumulase product and our api for hylenex 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production  work in process  and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at actual cost 
inventory is reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete items 
if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii item of this report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap

share based compensation through  we accounted for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method and recorded no stock based compensation for options granted to employees 
effective at the beginning of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  and elected to adopt the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires us to use a fair valued based method to account for share based compensation 
accordingly  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 
total compensation cost for our share based payments for the year ended december  was million 
sg a expense and research and development expense for the year ended december  included share based compensation of  and  respectively 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
interest income interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due to higher interest income as a result of maintaining higher average cash balances during net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was due to an increase in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million versus million as of december   an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from the net proceeds from the sale of common stock to new river management v  lp new river for approximately million in the second quarter of  approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock to an affiliate of baxter in february  and million of initial upfront payments from baxter during of which million was recorded as deferred revenue as of december   offset by our net cash used in operations and for the purchase of property and equipment for the year ended december  a member of our board of directors  randal j 
kirk  is an affiliate of new river 
additionally  we received cash of approximately million related to the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year ended december  operating activities net cash used by operations was  during the year ended december  compared to million of cash provided by operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to the million increase in the total net loss for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was due to the million initial up front payment received from roche in of which million was recorded as deferred revenue as of december  
table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this was due to the increased purchase of property and equipment during net cash used in investing activities was  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this was due to the increased purchase of property and equipment during financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we sold million shares of our common stock to new river for an aggregate price of approximately million 
in february  an affiliate of baxter purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million 
additionally  we received approximately million and million in net proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  in december  we sold common stock for approximately million  net of issuance costs 
additionally  we received approximately million in net proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises during the year ended december  we expect our cash requirements to increase significantly as we continue to increase our research and development for  seek regulatory approvals of  and develop and manufacture our current product candidates 
as we expand our research and development efforts and pursue additional product opportunities  we anticipate significant cash requirements for hiring of personnel  capital expenditures and investment in additional internal systems and infrastructure 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the research  development  manufacture  regulatory and market acceptance of our product candidates  if any  and the resources we devote to researching  developing  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our product candidates 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we anticipate cash expenses of approximately million to million  depending on the progress of various pre clinical and clinical programs and the timing of our manufacturing scale up 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of the roche and baxter collaborations and the sale of our common stock to new river 
we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  the exercise of our callable warrants  strategic collaboration agreements  debt financing  or any combination of the foregoing 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
which initially allowed us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities 
we have previously sold common stock under this registration statement for an aggregate of approximately million  so we currently have the ability to issue debt and equity securities for an aggregate of million 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate for our anticipated needs or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or delay the launch of our product candidates 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non 
table of contents exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license payments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for outsourced research and development services for our various pre clinical and clinical programs  for the manufacturing of our products for clinical and commercial use  and other recurring purchases and services made in the normal course of business 
as of december   we had no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities  the number and scope of our research activities  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain product discovery and development collaborations  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other highly liquid investments
