overview since its inception in september  neurogen has been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
the company has not derived any revenue or earnings from product sales and has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues or earnings 
revenues to date have come from six collaborative research agreements  one license agreement and one technology transfer agreement 
during  the company incurred significant expenses in conducting clinical trials and other development activities  such as formulation testing and toxicology studies for adipiplon  the company s lead compound for insomnia formerly ng  aplindore to be tested in phase trials for restless legs syndrome and parkinson s disease and ngd  the company s lead compound in its obesity program 
adipiplon is currently in phase testing for the treatment of insomnia  and preparations are underway for phase and testing in anxiety and schizophrenia 
if adipiplon and aplindore continue to progress in further studies for any of these indications without the company partnering the programs  clinical trial and other development expenses will continue to increase 
the actual amount of these development expenses will be determined by the results of each study in all of the adipiplon and aplindore programs 
in december  neurogen and merck sharp dohme limited  a subsidiary of merck co  inc  merck entered into a collaboration agreement to discover and develop next generation drugs targeting the vanilloid receptor vr for the treatment of pain 
as of december   neurogen had received million for the purchase of  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock at the initiation of the agreement  million in total license fees  million in research funding  and million in milestones from merck 
in september  neurogen and merck agreed to amend the collaboration agreement to extend the initial three year research program component of their vr collaboration 
in may  merck exercised its right to end the research program component of the collaboration providing days advance written notice 
the research component of the collaboration agreement and the company s remaining obligations concluded on august  the conclusion resulted in the acceleration of recognition of previously unearned license and non substantive milestone revenue  which was fully recognized by august collaborative agreements have been and are expected to continue to be a source of funding for the company 
such arrangements not only drive current revenue through the recognition of upfront and subsequent license fees  research funding and potential milestone payments  but over the longer term these arrangements may have a significant impact on potential future product revenue and earnings in the form of royalties if the agreements result in successful drug development and commercialization 
the initiation  expiration and specific terms of such agreements have contributed to  and will continue to cause  significant fluctuations in the company s recognized revenues and losses 
the company will continue to seek early stage partnerships for some research and development programs  while it selectively retains the rights to other drug programs to more advanced stages before considering partnership arrangements 
the decision of whether and when to partner a program is based on an analysis of development risk  resources required to complete each regulatory stage  and the amount of immediate versus long term return that could be extracted at each stage of development 
critical accounting policies the preparation of neurogen s financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in the valuation of marketable securities and investments  evaluation of investments and other assets for other than temporary impairment  accruals  revenue recognition  collaboration costs  income taxes and stock compensation 
actual amounts and outcomes could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of neurogen s financial statements revenue recognition periodically  neurogen enters into collaborative research agreements that  among other things  generally provide for the funding to neurogen of specified projects and the granting to neurogen s partners of certain development and commercialization rights related to potential discoveries 
revenue under these arrangements 
table of contents typically includes upfront non refundable fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research  milestone payments upon occurrence of certain events and royalties on product sales  if ever 
revenue recognized from collaborative agreements is based upon the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when there is a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf the upfront license payment would be recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have standalone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations is not determinable  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
when it is determined that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  the company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the performance obligations are expected to be completed 
in addition  if the company is involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  an assessment is made as to whether the involvement in the steering committee constituted a performance obligation or a right to participate 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone event is deemed to be substantive after considering all of the following conditions the milestone payment is non refundable  the achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of the substantive milestone conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon the sale of related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the collaborative agreement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  the royalty payment would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed 
in the financial statements  license fees revenue includes up front  anniversary license payments and non refundable fees under collaborative research agreements 
research revenue includes research funding for the company s staffing on projects and milestone payments under collaborative agreements 
deferred revenue arises from the payments received for research and development to be conducted in future periods or for licenses of neurogen s rights or technology where neurogen has continuing obligations 

table of contents research and development expenses all research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  external research studies  laboratory supplies  and overhead facilities expenses 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
the company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each month for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  neurogen accrues an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective application and began recognizing compensation expense for the estimated fair value of all share based payment awards 
under the modified prospective method  the company valued and expensed new awards granted after december   based on their grant date fair values and vesting schedules 
awards that were granted prior to december  but that vested after december  were expensed utilizing the pro forma expense previously calculated under sfas no 
as of december   no liability awards have been granted 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for grants of stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognized no employee compensation expense for the options when the option grants had an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
the company reported the disclosures as required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the company primarily grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period of the award  which in most cases equals the vesting period 
the company has selected the black scholes method to estimate the fair value of options 
the company has also issued restricted stock to key executives  which has been and will continue to be recorded as expense over the vesting period based upon the market price of the stock at date of grant 
the company occasionally grants stock option awards to consultants 
as required by sfas no 
r  such grants continue to be accounted for pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
compensation expense is based upon the fair value of such awards over the performance period using the black scholes method 
management also evaluated the assumptions that underlie the valuation of share based payment awards 
following is a summary of some of the principal assumptions and classifications the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
in predicting the life of option grants  all stock options meet the definition of plain vanilla options under sab no 
with the exception of option grants to the board of directors  and therefore  the simplified method was used to calculate the term for grants other than the board of directors 
the expected term for board of directors grants was calculated based upon historical analysis 
the expected term used during was not significantly different from the expected term used when following the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 

table of contents forfeitures of options are estimated based upon historical data and are adjusted based upon actual occurrences 
the cumulative effect of restricted stock forfeitures was immaterial 
in predicting expected volatility  assumptions were based solely upon historical volatilities of the company s stock  over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
the company relies only on historical volatility since future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical 
under sfas no 
r  the company has separated optionees into two groupings based upon historical analysis of the exercise behavior of those groupings first  management and the board of directors  and  second  non management employees 
however  given the company s current use of the simplified method  the establishment of these groupings is not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of expense 
the risk free rate utilized when valuing share based payment arrangements is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option being valued 
management s selection of the valuation components such as the black scholes pricing method  interest rate and volatility are consistent with the approach utilized when reporting pursuant to the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
marketable securities the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale securities as defined by the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses have been determined by the specific identification method and are included in investment income 
classifications of the company s marketable securities as other than available for sale pursuant to sfas no 
would possibly result in material impacts to the valuation of the securities and investment income 
the fair value of these securities is subject to volatility and change 
marketable securities at each of december  and consisted of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt securities 
at december   maturities ranged from approximately one month to approximately years and at december  from approximately one month to approximately years 
the company has classified all marketable securities as current under accounting research bulletin arb no 
chapter  paragraph  restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
such guidance indicates that a current classification is appropriate for resources such as marketable securities representing the investment of cash available for current operations 
neurogen periodically reviews its marketable securities portfolio for potential other than temporary impairment and recoverability 
gross unrealized losses for all investments in an unrealized loss position totaled million on aggregate fair value of million as of december  the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
based on the contractual terms and credit quality of these securities  and current market conditions  the company does not consider it probable that any of them will be settled by the issuer at a price less than the amortized cost of the investments 
since the company believes it has the ability and intends to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be at maturity  and because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  income taxes the liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  is used to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credit carryforwards  and differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations or a credit to additional paid in capital 
as of january   the company adopted financial interpretation number fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the 
table of contents position 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
neurogen has never paid federal or state income taxes due to its history of net operating losses 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of january and december   the company had no accruals for interest or penalties related to income tax matters 
the company believes that only one tax matter has uncertainty and it relates to an anticipated refund from the state of connecticut 
connecticut tax law provisions allow certain companies to obtain cash refunds at an exchange rate of of their research and development credits  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
long lived assets in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides that a an impairment loss should only be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and b the measurement of impairment loss should be based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
it also provides that a long lived asset or asset group should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment has occurred 
in addition  it provides for the use of probability weighted cash flow estimates in the recoverability test 
the company performs an annual review for possible impairment indicators and  if any are noted  would then perform a more substantive review for potential impairment of the relevant long lived asset or asset group 
neurogen also assesses the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that neurogen considers important and which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 
if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  it will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
neurogen has not experienced a significant triggering event as of year end and  therefore  has not recorded any impairment charges related to its long lived assets 
to the extent the company was to experience a triggering event  the resulting analysis may require an impairment charge to its statement of operations 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future collaborative research agreements  the progress of the company s independent and partnered research and development projects  the size of the company s staff and the level of preclinical and clinical development spending on drug candidates in unpartnered programs 
neurogen believes its research and development costs may increase significantly over the next several years as its drug development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses would be expected to increase to support any expanded research and development activities 
years ended december  and operating revenues 
total operating revenues for were million compared to million in the million increase resulted primarily from the accelerated recognition of million in license and research revenue associated with the original license fee  three anniversary payments  and a non substantive milestone under the collaboration agreement with merck see research collaborations section below due to the conclusion of the 
table of contents research program component of the company s vr collaboration 
the increase from acceleration was offset by a decrease of million for the recognition of research revenue in associated with fte funding which was received and unearned at the end of the research program and the company s remaining obligations concluded as of august   and as such  remaining unearned revenue was recognized ratably over the period between may and august  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million compared to million in  which was a million or increase 
clinical trials and development expenses increased in several of the company s unpartnered programs 
in the company s adipiplon program for insomnia  outsourced clinical expenses increased by million from million in to million in for phase and phase trials

r  as well as a decrease of million in computer and research supplies expense 
the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
while the company maintains a system to record the level of staff time spent on each of its research and development projects  it does not maintain a historical cost accounting system with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate its research and development costs on a specific project by project basis 
a significant portion of the company s research and development expenses  such as laboratory supplies  travel  information systems and services and facilities costs  benefit multiple projects and are not individually tracked to a specific project 
further  the company s staff timekeeping system does not account for differences in compensation costs between lower level technicians and more senior scientists 
general and administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million as compared to million in the million increase was due primarily to increases in legal expenses of million  market research of million  patent expenses of million  equipment and supplies expenses of million  facilities expenses of million  and recruiting expenses of million

other income  net of interest expense 
other income  net of interest expense  was million in compared to million in the million decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments resulting from a lower average balance of marketable securities in compared to income tax benefit 
the company recognized connecticut income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively 
the and benefits were the result of connecticut legislation that allows the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years

liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december  and  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate were million and million  respectively 
a total amount of million of the marketable securities at december  had maturities beyond one year 
however  the company can and may liquidate such investments prior to maturity to meet its operating  strategic and or investment objectives 
the company s combined cash and other short term investments decreased in due to funding of operating expenses and payments on outstanding loans as described below 
additionally  the company raised approximately million in through the sale of equity securities 
the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future as a result of operating needs and financing events 
the company intends to use its cash to pursue the further development of compounds in human clinical trials  the capabilities of its drug discovery platform and to enhance its capacity to pursue new drug targets  as well as fund general and corporate overhead 
neurogen believes this may allow it to retain a greater portion of commercial rights  potentially establish more valuable partnerships  and retain greater control over the drug development process

evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the company reviewed its marketable securities portfolio  which consists of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations  for potential other than temporary impairment 
gross unrealized losses related to the company s investments totaled million an aggregate fair value of million for all investments in unrealized loss positions as of december  all marketable securities held at december  have been in a continuous loss position for twelve months or more and the related unrealized loss was million 
the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
unrealized losses related to securities that mature beyond the next twelve months  and that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more  amounted to million  or  of the total market value of such marketable securities as of december  the company has not recorded any losses for other than temporary impairment at this time  however  if interest rates rise and such unrealized losses become more significant  the company may record impairment losses 
in evaluating the unrealized losses  the company considered the nature of the investments  current credit ratings  maturity dates and the company s projected cash requirements 
financing activities neurogen s cash requirements to date have been met primarily by the proceeds of its equity financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative research  licensing or technology transfer arrangements  certain debt arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
the company s equity financing activities have included underwritten public offerings of common stock  private placement offerings of common stock and private sales of common stock in connection with collaborative research and licensing agreements

table of contents future liquidity neurogen has not derived any product revenues from product sales and does not expect to derive any product revenues for at least the next several years  if at all 
prior to deriving any such product revenues  the company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows that in the aggregate could exceed the company s existing cash resources 
until the company can generate significant cash from operations  it expects to continue to fund its operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of its equity securities or received under former collaboration agreements 
in addition  neurogen likely will need to finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements  project financing and or debt financing 
however  the company may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  the company cannot be sure that its existing cash and securities available for sale resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
although the company recognizes the need to raise funds in the near future  it may be unsuccessful in consummating any such transaction  or  if it did consummate such a transaction  that the terms and conditions of such financing will be favorable to the company 
the company believes that its current assets will not be sufficient to fund its planned operations in the independent auditor s report to the company s audited financial statements for the period ended december  indicates that there are a number of factors that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
having insufficient funds may require neurogen to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of its research or development programs  relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than it would otherwise choose  eliminate or defer the start of clinical trials or the chemical formulation and manufacturing efforts required to advance drug candidates  sell some or all of its capital assets and lease back a portion  pursue merger and acquisition strategies 
failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect the company s ability to operate as a going concern 
if the company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
other financing arrangements  such as project financings  may also have an equity component  also resulting in dilution to existing stockholders 
if the company raises additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict its ability to operate its business 
neurogen s ability to fund its operations until such time as it achieves sustainable revenues may depend on its ability to develop drug discovery programs of sufficient value to either partner the programs with pharmaceutical companies or raise capital through debt or equity financings 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s currently unpartnered programs in insomnia  anxiety  schizophrenia  parkinson s disease  rls  or earlier stage programs  such progress could lead to the opportunity to partner on terms which provide capital  revenues and cash flows to the company or the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if unpartnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
lack of progress  scheduling delays or failures in any of the company s major programs could significantly reduce the company s ability to access capital and cash available to fund its business 
these factors could also significantly increase the company s cost of capital and limit its ability to raise equity capital 
all of the company s compounds in development  whether in human clinical trials or not  will require significant additional research  development and testing before they can be commercialized 
furthermore  the scope  magnitude and timing of future research and development expenses  as well as anticipated project completion dates  are a series of steps  ranging from preclinical testing to clinical studies in humans 
each step in the process is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and cost for completion depends on the specific progress of each product being tested 

table of contents while the company cannot accurately predict the time required or the cost involved in commercializing any one of its candidates  new drug development typically takes many years and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 
in addition  developing new drugs is an extremely uncertain process where most candidates fail and uncertain developments such as clinical or regulatory delays  side effects  undesirable drug properties or ineffectiveness of a drug candidate would slow or prevent the development of a product 
if neurogen or its partner merck is unable to commercialize one or more of the drugs that may result from its development programs  the company may never achieve product revenues and may eventually be unable to continue operations 
this result would cause its stockholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 
neurogen s funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of the company s research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the timing of regulatory approvals  determinations as to the commercial potential of its proposed products  the status of competitive products  and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  manufacturing and marketing products

collaborations wyeth pharmaceuticals 
in november  neurogen acquired worldwide rights to aplindore  a small molecule partial agonist for the d dopamine receptor  from wyeth pharmaceuticals  a division of wyeth 
along with the initial million license fee paid upon signing  neurogen paid wyeth million for the shipment of compound material suitable for phase trials and is required to pay approximately million in annual maintenance fees upon the annual anniversaries of the effective date of the agreement until nda approval 
there is also potential for neurogen to pay milestone payments upon the successful achievement of clinical development and regulatory events and eventual commercialization in identified countries as well as royalties on worldwide sales

neurogen is scheduled to commence phase trials in parkinson s disease and rls with aplindore in early the compound was initially developed by wyeth for use in schizophrenia  and wyeth had studied the compound in six clinical trials involving over healthy volunteers and over schizophrenic patients 
merck 
in december  neurogen entered into a collaboration agreement with merck to research  develop  and commercialize small molecule medicines that work by targeting vr  a key integrator of pain signals in the nervous system 
in january  under the terms of the collaboration agreement  the company received a payment of million for license fees and sold to merck  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock for an additional million 
merck agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of discovery and research resources for an initial three year period and to pay additional license fees totaling million on the first three anniversary dates of the collaboration 
under the collaboration agreement  merck is responsible for funding the cost of development  including clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of collaboration products  if any 
merck will pay neurogen royalties based upon net sales levels  if any  for collaboration products 
the collaboration agreement provided merck the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional two years 
on september   neurogen and merck agreed by amending the collaboration agreement to extend the research program component of their vr collaboration 
under the amended collaboration agreement  merck had the option to end the research program component of the collaboration by providing days advance written notice to neurogen 
merck exercised this right  and notice was provided to neurogen on may  the research component of the collaboration agreement and the company s remaining obligations concluded on august  the conclusion resulted in the acceleration of revenue recognition of previously unearned license and non substantive milestone revenue  which was fully recognized by august  as of december   the company had received million of research funding from merck  two million license payments on the first and second anniversary dates of the collaboration in december and and one million license payment on the third anniversary date of the collaboration in december the company is eligible to receive milestone payments if certain compound discovery  product development or regulatory objectives are achieved through the collaboration

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
increasing interest rates have led to a decline in market values of fixed rate investments held as of december  the company considers such impairment as temporary because of its ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be at maturity 

table of contents the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands fair value of investments with expected maturities in the following years total fixed rate investments weighted average interest capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through collaborative partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies  which sometimes include an equity purchase by neurogen s partner 
another source of funding is further equity offerings to financial investors 
the ability of the company to raise funds in both of these cases  and the desirability of raising such funds  is dependent upon capital markets forces affecting the price of the company s stock 
these market forces  which fluctuate widely and frequently in the biotechnology capital markets  include both general market conditions and specific conditions  such as the stock performance of peer companies  rotation of funds from various market sectors  including sectors defined by market capitalization  stage of development or therapeutic focus and the activities of large holders of individual stocks 
because a significant majority of neurogen s stock is held by only a few institutions and the average trading volume of the stock is relatively low  changes in general or specific market conditions can significantly impact the stock price of the company
