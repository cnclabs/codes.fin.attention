item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
the company is a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its pharmacy  physician  and manufacturer customers  which currently are based primarily in the united states and canada 
the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers 
substantially all of the company s operations are located in the united states and canada 
the company also has a pharmaceutical packaging operation in the united kingdom 
on july   the company completed the spin off of its former institutional pharmacy business  pharmerica long term care long term care 
in connection with the spin off  the company continues to distribute pharmaceuticals to and generate cash flows from the disposed institutional pharmacy business 
the historical operating results of long term care are not reported as a discontinued operation of the company because of the significance of the continuing cash flows resulting from the pharmaceutical distribution agreement entered into between the disposed component and the company 
for periods prior to august   the company s operating results include long term care 
historically  the company has evaluated and reported gross profit  operating expense  and operating income margins as a percentage of operating revenue because the gross profit and operating expenses relating to bulk deliveries were negligible  as a majority of this revenue represented direct shipments from manufacturers to customers warehouses 
in fiscal  the company began to transition a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis to an operating revenue basis as a result of a new contract that the company signed with its largest customer 
as a result  the company s revenue from bulk deliveries in the future will be insignificant to its total revenue and  therefore  beginning in fiscal  the company began to report gross profit  operating expense  and operating income margins as a percentage of total revenue refer to summary segment information table on page 
acquisition on october   the company acquired bellco health for a purchase price of million  net of million of cash acquired 
bellco is a pharmaceutical distributor in the metro new york city area  where it primarily services independent retail community pharmacies 
the acquisition of bellco expanded the company s presence in this large community pharmacy market 
nationally  bellco markets and sells generic pharmaceuticals to individual retail pharmacies  and provides pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics 
bellco s revenues were billion in fiscal divestiture during fiscal  the company committed to a plan to divest its workers compensation business  pmsi 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company classified pmsi s assets and liabilities as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets and classified pmsi s operating results and cash flows as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements for the current and prior fiscal years presented 
previously  pmsi was included in the company s other reportable segment 
in october  the company completed the sale of pmsi for approximately million  net of a working capital adjustment  including a million subordinated note payable due from pmsi on the fifth anniversary of the closing date the maturity date  of which million may be payable in october  if pmsi achieves certain revenue targets with respect to its largest customer 
interest  which accrues at an annual rate of  will be payable in cash on a quarterly basis  if pmsi achieves a defined minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or will be compounded semi annually and paid at maturity 
additionally  if pmsi s annual net revenue exceeds certain 
table of contents thresholds through december  the company may be entitled to additional payments of up to million under the subordinated note payable due from pmsi on the maturity date of the note 
the company recorded a non cash charge of million in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of pmsi 
this charge  which is included in the loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september   was comprised of a million write off of pmsi s goodwill and a million charge to record the company s loss on the sale of pmsi 
the tax benefit recorded in connection with the above charge was minimal as the loss on the sale of pmsi will be treated as a capital loss for income tax purposes  and the company does not have significant capital gains to offset the capital loss 
reportable segments the company s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and other 
the other reportable segment includes the operating results of long term care  through the july  spin off date 
the operating results of pmsi  which was sold in october  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
pharmaceutical distribution during fiscal  the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment was comprised of four operating segments  which included the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc  the amerisourcebergen specialty group absg  bellco health bellco  and the amerisourcebergen packaging group abpg 
we recently completed our integration of bellco s separate operations within abdc and absg and as of september   the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment was comprised of three operating segments  which included abdc  absg and abpg 
servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel  the pharmaceutical distribution segment s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals  over the counter healthcare products  home healthcare supplies and equipment  and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers  including acute care hospitals and health systems  independent and chain retail pharmacies  mail order pharmacies  medical clinics  long term care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers 
abdc also provides pharmacy management  staffing and other consulting services  scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment  medication and supply dispensing cabinets  and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 
absg  through a number of individual operating businesses  provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology  and to other healthcare providers  including dialysis clinics 
absg also distributes vaccines  other injectables  plasma  and other blood products 
in addition  through its specialty services businesses  absg provides a number of commercialization services  third party logistics  group purchasing  and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers  as well as reimbursement consulting  data analytics  practice management  and physician education 
as previously noted  the dialysis related business of bellco has been integrated within absg as of september  abpg consists of american health packaging  anderson packaging anderson  and brecon pharmaceuticals limited brecon 
american health packaging delivers unit dose  punch card  unit of use  and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 
american health packaging s largest customer is abdc  and  as a result  its operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc 
anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 
brecon is a united kingdom based provider of contract packaging and clinical trials materials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 
other prior to its divestiture  long term care was a leading national dispenser of pharmaceutical products and services to patients in long term care and alternate site settings  including skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities and residential living communities 
long term care s institutional pharmacy business involved the purchase of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals  principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment  and the dispensing of those products to residents in long term care and alternate site facilities

table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue of billion in fiscal  which excludes bulk deliveries  increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due to growth in our pharmaceutical distribution segment  particularly within our abdc operating segment  and the bellco acquisition 
additionally  in the march quarter  we began to transition a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis to an operating revenue basis 
this business transition  which contributed of the operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended september   resulted from a new contract that we signed with our largest customer 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer  and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites ie  drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites ie  cross dock shipment 
bulk deliveries of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
this decline was due to the customer transition discussed above 
the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased  and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products  whether the products are drop shipped or shipped cross dock 
the company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer 
as a result  and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers 
total revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was driven by the pharmaceutical distribution segment  which received a contribution from the bellco acquisition 
gross profit of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
this decline was related to the other segment  as prior year s consolidated results included million of gross profit from the operating results of long term care through the july spin off date 
the other segment gross profit decrease was offset  in part  by the increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment s gross profit for the fiscal year ended september   primarily due to revenue growth  including the acquisition of bellco 
in fiscal and  we recognized gains of million and million  respectively  from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these gains  which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties  were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed and of gross profit in fiscal and  respectively 
the company is unable to estimate future gains  if any  it will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year  which included the operating results of long term care 
distribution  selling and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization dsad a of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
this decline was related to the other segment  as prior year s consolidated results included million of dsad a from the operating results of long term care and was partially offset by operating expenses of our recent acquisitions  primarily those of bellco

remaining unpaid amounts of million for employee severance  lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september  most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time  generally not in excess of months  while others may receive a lump sum payment 
operating income of million in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year due to the or million increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment s operating income  which was offset  in part  by a decrease of million in gains from antitrust litigation settlements  and an increase of million in facility consolidation  employee severance and other costs

interest income decreased substantially from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline of average invested cash and short term investments from million during the prior fiscal year to million during fiscal the decrease in invested cash and short term investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our use of cash for share repurchases  acquisitions  and capital expenditures  all of which  in the aggregate  exceeded our net cash provided by operating activities since the prior fiscal year 
our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon our borrowings  interest rates  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of  versus in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the company having benefited less in the current year from tax free investment income 
we expect our effective tax rate going forward will approximate the fiscal tax rate 
we adopted fasb s financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective october  the cumulative effect of adoption of this interpretation resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings 
the adoption of the provisions of fin no 
did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal income from continuing operations of million in fiscal decreased from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating income was offset by the increase in net interest expense and the increase in the effective income tax rate 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of increased from per share in the prior fiscal year

segment information pharmaceutical distribution pharmaceutical distribution total revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of abdc and the acquisition of bellco  which contributed of the total revenue increase 
during fiscal  of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison with the prior fiscal year results  sales to institutional customers increased primarily due to the acquisition of bellco the revenue of which is heavily weighted towards institutional customers and the strong growth of certain large customers 
sales to retail customers decreased primarily due to our decision not to renew a contract  effective january  with a large retail customer and the july  loss of certain business totaling approximately billion of annual revenue from a large retail drug chain customer 
abdc s total revenue excluding bellco increased by in fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to the increase in sales to certain of our large institutional customers  offset  in part  by the decline in retail customer revenue  as discussed above 
absg s total revenue excluding bellco of billion in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong double digit growth of its non oncology distribution businesses 
oncology distribution s revenue  which represents approximately of absg s total revenue  was flat compared to the prior fiscal year 
absg s revenue growth was affected primarily by declining anemia drug sales and by one of its large customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october the former customer contributed approximately million to absg s revenue in fiscal the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals  primarily injectibles  to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg also distributes vaccines  plasma  and other blood products 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes to this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 
revenue related to the distribution of anemia related products  which represented approximately of pharmaceutical distribution s total revenue in fiscal  decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
the decline in sales of anemia related products since the second half of fiscal has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment 
sales of oncology anemia related products represented approximately of total revenue in fiscal and decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs  including expanded 
table of contents warning and other product safety labeling requirements  more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis  and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use 
the us food and drug administration fda has announced that it is reviewing new clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and may take additional action with regard to these drugs 
in march  manufacturers of certain anemia products announced further labeling revisions to reflect additional safety information 
moreover  the fda announced on july  that it is ordering additional safety labeling changes related to the use of the drugs in the treatment of certain cancers 
as a result  we expect oncology related anemia drug sales to decline further in fiscal from our fiscal total 
cms has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future 
also  on july   cms announced it is considering a review of national medicare coverage policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or pre dialysis chronic kidney disease 
further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payors  including federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
our future revenue growth rate and or profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs 
we currently expect that our total revenue growth in fiscal will be between and  as this range reflects market growth of as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc  ims  the expected strong growth of certain of our large institutional customers  primarily within abdc  offset in part by the loss of certain business with a national retail chain customer to a competitor  effective july  sales to this chain customer approximated billion of total revenue in fiscal the pharmaceutical distribution segment s expected growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization  the introduction of new products  and higher pharmaceutical prices offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
the segment s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry sales in the united states  as estimated by ims  are expected to grow between and in and and between and during the five year period ending ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market  such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market 
the pharmaceutical distribution segment s future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates  changes in federal government rules and regulations  industry growth trends  such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers  and general economic conditions 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to revenue growth  growth of our generic programs  the acquisition of bellco  and strong brand name manufacturer price appreciation 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit in fiscal and was and  respectively 
fiscal gross profit benefited from gains of million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer an independent retail group purchasing organization and a major competitor and a million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier  and was offset  in part  by an million inventory write down of certain pharmacy dispensing equipment 
fiscal gross profit was impacted by absg s million charge relating to the write down of tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note of consolidated financial statements 
our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal lifo charge reflects greater brand name supplier price inflation  which more than offset the impact of price deflation of generic drugs 
during fiscal  inventory declines resulted in liquidation 
table of contents of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior fiscal year 
the effect of the liquidation in fiscal was to decrease cost of goods sold by million 
pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of billion in fiscal increased million or from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily related to the operating expenses of our recent acquisitions  primarily those of bellco 
additionally  operating expenses in fiscal were impacted by abdc impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling million  primarily due to abdc s decision to abandon the use of certain software which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project 
operating expenses in fiscal were also impacted by a million write down of intangible assets relating to certain smaller business units 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year due to improvements in operating leverage  primarily in abdc  where operating expenses declined despite an increase in total revenue  due to a more streamlined organizational structure within abdc and absg and the cost savings achieved resulting from our ce initiative

the operating results of pmsi  which was sold in october  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
intersegment eliminations these amounts represent the elimination of the pharmaceutical distribution segment s sales to the other segment 
abdc was the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to the other segment 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue of billion in fiscal  which excludes bulk deliveries  increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to increases in operating revenue in our abdc and absg operating segments  both of which are included in the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment 
our acquisitions contributed of the operating revenue growth in fiscal the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products

the abdc total revenue growth rate in fiscal benefited from increased sales to certain of its large customers and the revenue contribution resulting from the full year impact of its canadian acquisitions 
abdc s total revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by the company s decision not to renew a contract  effective january  with a large  low margin customer that contributed approximately billion of total revenue for abdc in fiscal and the july loss of two customer accounts that totaled billion of revenue in fiscal these customer accounts transitioned to another distributor after they were acquired by a company supplied by that distributor

the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in total revenue  an increase in compensation under our fee for service agreements  and the growth of our generic programs offset in part by competitive pricing pressures and absg s million charge relating to the write down of tetanus diphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note of the consolidated financial statements

the company s cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
during fiscal  inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year 
the effect of the liquidation in fiscal was to decrease cost of goods sold by million 
pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily related to our total revenue growth  operating expenses of our acquired companies  an increase in bad debt expense of million primarily related to the bankruptcy of a retail chain customer in our west region and an increase in share based compensation  and was partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses in fiscal decreased basis points from the prior fiscal year due to economies of scale realized as a result of the increase in operating revenue  productivity gains achieved throughout the company s distribution network as a result of our optimiz program and a decrease in employee incentive compensation  and was partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense and the operating costs of our recently acquired companies

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  the company considers a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  its customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables 
each of the company s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
the company writes off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and the company s largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september   and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
long term care s bad debt expense  which is included in the above amounts  for the fiscal years ended september  and was million and million  respectively 
the bankruptcy of a regional chain customer in abdc s west region accounted for a significant portion of the increase in bad debt expense from fiscal to fiscal an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 
supplier reserves the company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the company 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the company 
the company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from the company s estimate 
loss contingencies the company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
the company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

table of contents merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of the company s inventories at september  and  respectively  have been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if the company had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge credit of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
during the fiscal year ended september   inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years 
the effect of the liquidation in fiscal was to decrease cost of goods sold by million and increase diluted earnings per share by 
business combinations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  non compete agreements  patents and software technology  are amortized over their useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas no 
 a determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of the company s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
in fiscal  pmsi experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar as a result  and after considering other factors  the company committed to a plan to divest pmsi 
the company performed an interim impairment test of its pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired 
therefore  pmsi wrote off the carrying value of its goodwill of million 
in addition  it also recognized charges of million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company completed its required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents fiscal and  as a result  recorded million of impairment charges 
the company s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the company s future financial results 
share based compensation the company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 
income taxes the company s income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
the company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  the company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
fin no 
also provides guidance  among other things  on the measurement of the income tax benefit associated with uncertain tax positions  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties and financial statement disclosures 
the company has established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under fin no 
the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  the company s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of the company s assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in the company s effective tax rate by on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal
