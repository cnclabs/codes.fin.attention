management periodically reviews certain key business metrics in order to evaluate our strategy and operational efficiency  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
these key business metrics include the following revenue management reviews many elements to understand our revenue stream 
these elements include supply availability  unit shipments  average selling prices and channel inventory levels 
revenues are impacted by unit shipments and variations in average selling prices 
unit shipments are determined by supply availability  timing of wireless carrier certification  end user and channel demand  and channel inventory 
we monitor average selling prices throughout the product life cycle  taking into account market demand and competition 
to avoid empty shelves at retail store locations and to minimize product returns and obsolescence  we strive to maintain channel inventory levels within a desired range 
margins we review gross margin in conjunction with revenues to maximize operating performance 
we strive to improve our gross margin through disciplined cost and product life cycle management  supply demand management and control of our warranty and technical support costs 
to achieve desired operating margins  we also monitor our operating expenses closely to keep them in line with our projected revenue 
cash flows we strive to convert operating results to cash 
to that end  we carefully manage our working capital requirements through balancing accounts receivable and inventory with accounts payable 
we monitor our cash balances to maintain cash available to support our operating  investing and financing requirements 
we believe the mobile lifestyle solutions market dynamics are generally favorable to us 
the high speed wireless networks which enable true always on connectivity are fueling the growth of the market for smartphone devices 
with our computing heritage  we are able to work closely with wireless carriers to deploy advanced wireless data applications that take advantage of their wireless data networks 
the smartphone market is emerging and people are beginning to understand the personal and professional benefits of being able to access email or browse the web on a smartphone 
we intend to lead on design  ease of use and functionality and serve a broad range of customers with products focused on their needs 
we expect this market to expand and we are focusing our efforts in order to capitalize on this expansion 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palm s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  these estimates and judgments are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for rebates  price protection  product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty and technical service costs  impairment of auction rate securities  royalty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  restructurings  inventory  stock based compensation and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and aicpa statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of mobile 
table of contents products under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  net of estimated returns  provided that the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
for our web sales distributors  we recognize revenue based on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distributor 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return and price protection 
accordingly  revenue is reduced for our estimates of liability related to these rights 
the estimate for returns is recorded at the time the related sale is recognized and is adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related factors 
actual returns may differ from our estimates 
the reserves for rebates and price protection are recorded at the time these programs are offered in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
price protection is estimated based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
rebates are estimated based on specific programs  actual wireless carrier purchase volumes and the expected percentage of end users that will redeem their rebates  which is estimated based on historical experience 
rebate estimates are refined over the program period as actual results are experienced 
we have accrued rebate obligations of million as of may  which are included in other accrued liabilities 
actual claims for returns  price protection and rebates may vary over time and could differ from our estimates 
revenue from software arrangements with end users of our devices is recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method 
when all of the undelivered elements are software related  this allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered items 
vsoe is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately  but is expected to be sold in the marketplace within six months of the initial determination of the price by management 
when the undelivered elements include non software related items  this allocation is based on objective and reliable evidence of fair value  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we defer the portion of the fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a change in a major customer s creditworthiness or actual defaults differ from our historical experience  our actual results could differ from our estimates of recoverability 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of repair as a percentage of shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  service policies and our experience with products in production or distribution 
if we experience claims or significant changes in costs of services  such as third party vendor charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our cost of revenues could differ from our estimates 
royalty obligations we accrue for royalty obligations to certain technology and patent holders based on unit shipments of our smartphones and handheld computers  a percentage of applicable revenue for the net sales of products using certain software technologies or a fully paid up license fee  all as determined in accordance with the applicable license agreements 
where agreements are not finalized  accrued royalty obligations represent management s current best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections based on negotiations with third party licensors 
we have accrued royalty obligations of million as of may   including estimated royalties of million which are reported in other accrued liabilities 
while the amounts ultimately 
table of contents agreed upon may be more or less than the current accrual  management does not believe that finalization of the agreements would have had a material impact on the amounts reported for our financial position as of may  or on the results reported for the year then ended  however  the effect of finalization of these agreements in the future may be significant to the period in which recorded 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets such as property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting unit level within our single reporting segment 
a goodwill impairment loss would be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized for an intangible asset to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined based upon the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition 
cash flow estimates used in evaluating for impairment represent management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
restructuring costs effective for calendar year  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred 
prior to calendar year  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken 
we record initial restructuring charges based on assumptions and related estimates that we deem appropriate for the economic environment at the time these estimates are made 
we reassess restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as liabilities are incurred 
inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 

table of contents we rely primarily on the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  expected risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on historical time from vesting until exercise and the expected term of employee stock purchase plan shares using the average life of the purchase periods under each offering 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon the implied volatility derived from the historical market prices of our traded options with similar terms 
our decision to use this measure of volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that this measure of volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility in our common stock 
we base the risk free interest rate for option valuation on constant maturity treasury rates provided by the united states treasury with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of share based awards to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we determined the fair value of modifications made to stock options in september and october in connection with the recapitalization transaction using the trinomial lattice simulation model 
we used the inputs and assumptions described above for volatility  risk free interest rate and estimated dividends 
we also incorporated an early exercise multiple of  the stock prices on the dates of modification adjusted for the per share distribution and the strike prices of the affected awards adjusted for the per share distribution 
the geometric brownian motion simulation model was utilized to determine the fair value of stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards granted with market conditions  or performance of palm s stock price  in connection with the recapitalization transaction 
this model was utilized in order to incorporate more complex variables than closed form models such as the black scholes option valuation model 
we used the inputs and assumptions described above for volatility  risk free interest rate and estimated dividends 
we also incorporated the specific terms of the awards to simulate multiple stock price paths over the various vesting periods to determine the average net present value across the simulation trials 
the geometric brownian motion simulation model is based on trials simulating the achievement of the market conditions and calculating the net present value of the fair value over all of the trials 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency between periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
non current auction rate securities we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represent investments in pools of assets  including commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  credit linked notes and credit derivative products 
these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and  during fiscal year  auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not 
table of contents currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
historically  the fair value of ars investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of may  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of may   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  of which million was deemed temporary and million was recognized as a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge 
we review our impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in evaluating the impairment of any individual ars  we classified such impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our current intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  liquidity and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
income taxes our deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  based on forecasts of results and certain of our tax planning strategies 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance based upon current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future years 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes 
on june   we adopted fasb financial interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken 
table of contents in a tax return 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit and new exposures 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
our key critical accounting policies are periodically reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended may  and revenues years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands revenues we derive our revenues from sales of our smartphones  handheld computers  add ons and accessories 
revenues for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year smartphone revenue was  million in fiscal year and decreased approximately from  million in fiscal year handheld revenue was million in fiscal year and decreased from million in fiscal year during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
during fiscal year  net device units shipped were approximately  units at an average selling price of per unit 
of this decrease in revenues  approximately percentage points resulted from the decrease in average selling price and approximately percentage point resulted from the decrease in unit shipments and accessories sales 
the decrease in our average selling price is a result of a shift in product mix during the year towards lower priced centro smartphone products and a reduction in the volume of certain of our treo smartphone products which carry higher average selling prices 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for product return reserves attributable to lower return rates 
the decrease in unit shipments is primarily due to a decline in traditional handheld unit shipments as a result of the declining handheld market  partially offset by an increase in smartphone unit shipments 
we expect our handheld business to continue to decline in fiscal year international revenues were approximately of worldwide revenues in fiscal year  compared with approximately in fiscal year of the decrease in worldwide revenues for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  approximately percentage points resulted from a decrease in united states revenues and percentage points resulted from a decrease in international revenues 
average selling prices for our units decreased by in the united states and by internationally during fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in average selling prices in each region is primarily the result of a shift in product mix during the year towards lower priced smartphone products and a reduction in the volume of certain of our smartphone products which carry higher average selling prices 
net unit devices shipped increased approximately in the united states and decreased approximately internationally compared to the prior year 
the increase in net units sold in the united states is primarily the result of the success of our centro smartphone products  offset by a decline in traditional handheld unit sales 
the decrease in net units sold internationally is primarily due to a decline in traditional handheld units as a result of the declining handheld market  coupled with a decrease in smartphone unit sales 
cost of revenues years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands cost of revenues cost of revenues principally consists of material and transformation costs to manufacture our products  os and other royalty expenses  warranty and technical support costs  freight  scrap and rework costs  the cost of excess or obsolete inventory and manufacturing overhead which includes manufacturing personnel related costs  depreciation and allocated information technology and facilities costs 
cost of revenues as a percentage of 
table of contents revenues increased by percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year of the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  percentage points resulted from a shift in product mix towards smartphone products with lower margins 
the cost of warranty repairs increased percentage points compared to fiscal year primarily due to a higher per unit repair cost  coupled with a shift in mix to smartphone products  which carry a higher per unit repair cost 
an increase in freight charges resulted in a percentage point increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues as a result of expedited shipments and fuel surcharges 
additionally  cancellation charges from certain vendors resulted in a percentage point increase in cost of revenues due to our lower than anticipated purchase volumes of certain components and technical service costs increased approximately percentage points due to higher smartphone unit volumes with higher per unit call costs 
these increased costs as a percentage of revenues were partially offset by a percentage point decrease in os royalty costs primarily because of a shift in mix towards palm os based smartphone products  which carry a lower average os cost per unit than windows mobile powered smartphone products 
sales and marketing years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of advertising and marketing programs  salaries and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses and allocated information technology and facilities costs 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues is due to the decrease in our revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars is primarily due to the following factors 
employee related and travel expenses decreased approximately million resulting from a decrease in average headcount of approximately employees  as well as a decrease in the recruiting of sales and marketing personnel and their related employment costs during fiscal year compared to the prior year 
consulting expenses  including outsourced operations of our retail stores  decreased approximately million as a result of the closure of our retail stores during the third quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by increased outsourcing to support our product launches 
we experienced a decrease in our marketing development expenses with our wireless carrier customers of approximately million as a result of lower overall carrier revenue compared to the prior year 
we experienced a decrease of approximately million in direct marketing expenses as a result of providing fewer smartphone units to our wireless carrier partners for demonstration purposes during fiscal year as compared to the year ago period 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in allocated costs of approximately million as a result of higher information technology and facilities costs primarily due to software system implementations and related depreciation 
in addition  we experienced an increase in marketing  advertising and trade show costs of approximately million due to an increased focus on our brand and centro smartphones marketing campaigns  partially offset by our participation in fewer trade show events and the streamlining of other advertising efforts during the year 
research and development years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist principally of employee related costs  third party development costs  program materials  depreciation and allocated information technology and facilities costs 
research and development expenses during fiscal year increased approximately from the comparable period a year 
table of contents ago 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues and in absolute dollars during fiscal year is due to several factors 
higher information technology and facilities costs resulted in an increase of allocated costs of approximately million over the prior year  primarily due to software system implementations and related depreciation 
outsourced engineering  consulting and project material costs increased approximately million  reflecting increased costs related to product certifications with wireless carriers coupled with increased preproduction builds relative to the same period last year 
this was partially offset by a more streamlined engineering process during the current year  which was primarily driven by our effort to focus on developing a single palm software platform 
an increase in employee related expenses of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in employment incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation as a result of not meeting our operational objectives for fiscal year stock based compensation increased approximately million which is primarily the result of a million charge taken for the modifications made to certain stock option plans in connection with the recapitalization transaction  partially offset by the result of lower weighted average fair value assumptions for the year 
general and administrative years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee related costs  travel expenses and allocated information technology and facilities costs for finance  legal  human resources and executive functions  outside legal and accounting fees  provision for doubtful accounts and business insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses during fiscal year increased approximately from the comparable period a year ago 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues during fiscal year is due to several factors 
higher information technology and facilities costs resulted in an increase of allocated costs of approximately million  primarily due to software system implementations and related depreciation 
additionally  an increase in employee related expenses of approximately million was primarily the result of increased recruiting fees for key management positions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional and legal expenses of approximately million  primarily as a result of lower costs for legal settlements and defense of patent litigation during fiscal year stock based compensation expense increased by approximately million  which is the result of a million charge taken for the modification made to certain stock option plans in connection with the recapitalization transaction coupled with a higher average balance of outstanding stock based awards  partially offset by the result of lower weighted average fair value assumptions for the year 
amortization of intangible assets years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands amortization of intangible assets the increase in amortization of intangible assets in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year is due to a higher average balance of intangible assets during fiscal year as compared to the prior year 

table of contents patent acquisition cost years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands patent acquisition cost during the first quarter of fiscal year  we acquired patents and patent applications for million 
these patents and patent applications were acquired for strategic purposes in order to more effectively respond to intellectual property claims which may arise in the course of our business and  as of that date  were not acquired directly for the purpose of incorporating specific features into future products or for specific features in current products for which we currently pay or expect to pay royalties 
accordingly  the acquisition cost was expensed during the period of acquisition 
restructuring charges years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands restructuring charges restructuring charges relate to the implementation of a series of reorganization actions taken to streamline our business structure 
restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year of approximately million consist of approximately million related to restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of fiscal year  approximately million related to restructuring actions taken during the second quarter of fiscal year and approximately million related to restructuring actions taken during the first quarter of fiscal year these fiscal year restructuring actions were partially offset by adjustments of million related to restructuring actions taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of more current information regarding future estimated sublease income and million related to restructuring actions taken in connection with the handspring acquisition which is now complete 
the third quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions included charges of approximately million related to workforce reductions across all geographic regions  primarily related to severance  benefits and related costs due to the reduction of approximately regular employees and approximately million related to facilities and property and equipment that would be disposed of or removed from service in fiscal year  including the closure of our retail stores 
this facilities and property and equipment charge includes approximately million related to property and equipment disposed of or removed from service and other charges related to the closure of our retail stores and approximately million for lease commitments for facilities no longer in service 
we took these restructuring actions to better align our cost structure with current revenue expectations 
our third quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by the third quarter of fiscal year when complete  these actions are expected to result in annual expense reductions of at least million related to compensation reductions  all of which are expected to have a positive impact on cash flows in future years 
as of may   cash payments totaling approximately million related to workforce reductions and million related to facilities and property and equipment had been made related to these actions 
the second quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions included project cancellation costs relating to the foleo mobile companion product and discontinued development projects of approximately million 
restructuring charges were a result of our decision to focus our efforts on developing a single palm software platform and to offer a consistent user experience centered on the new platform 

table of contents our second quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions are expected to be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal year as of may   cash payments of approximately million have been made related to these actions 
the first quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions included charges of approximately million related to workforce reductions  including approximately million related to stock based compensation as a result of the acceleration of certain awards and approximately million for other severance  benefits and related costs and approximately million relating to property and equipment disposed of or removed from service 
the excess facilities and equipment costs were recognized for lease commitments  payable over approximately three years  offset by estimated sublease proceeds of approximately million 
workforce reductions for the restructuring actions begun in the first quarter of fiscal year affected approximately regular employees primarily in the united states 
we took these restructuring actions to better align our cost structure with current revenue expectations 
our first quarter of fiscal year restructuring actions are complete except for remaining contractual payments for excess facilities 
these actions are expected to result in annual expense reductions of at least million related to compensation reductions  all of which are expected to have a positive impact on cash flows in future years 
as of may   cash payments totaling approximately million related to workforce reductions and million related to facilities and property and equipment had been made related to these actions 
gain on sale of land years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands gain on sale of land in august  we entered into an agreement with a real estate broker to market for sale the acres of land owned by palm in san jose  california 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we reclassified the land as land held for sale at that time 
the sale closed during the first quarter of fiscal year and we received proceeds from the sale of land of approximately million and recognized a gain on the sale  net of closing costs  of approximately million 
in process research and development years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands in process research and development in process research and development for fiscal year in absolute dollars was the result of the acquisition of assets completed during the third quarter of fiscal year which included purchased in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and was charged to operations 

table of contents impairment of non current auction rate securities years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands impairment of non current auction rate securities impairment of non current auction rate securities for fiscal year reflects an impairment charge of million recognized on our non current auction rate securities 
these non current auction rate securities are interest bearing and represent investments in pools of assets  including commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  credit linked notes and credit derivative products 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investments in ars as of may  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of may  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  of which million was deemed temporary and million was recognized as a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  liquidity and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 
we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact  if any  on the fair value of our ars investments 
interest expense years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands interest expense interest expense during fiscal year increased as a result of the higher outstanding debt balance as compared to the fiscal year following the closing of the recapitalization transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year  we increased our outstanding debt balance by million 
interest income years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands interest income the overall decrease in interest income in absolute dollars is due to a lower average cash and short term investment balance during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year other income expense  net years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands other income expense  net other income expense for fiscal years and consisted of bank and other miscellaneous charges and net gains on sales of investments 
the change compared to fiscal year is not significant 

table of contents income tax provision benefit years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit the income tax benefit for fiscal year was million  which consisted of federal  state and foreign income taxes and represents an effective tax rate of 
this rate differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state taxes  foreign income taxed at different rates  non deductible stock based compensation expense  an increase in our valuation allowance primarily related to non deductible impairment charges of certain investments and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
although we have determined that a valuation allowance is not required with respect to most of our domestic net operating loss carryforwards  deferred expenses and tax credit carryforwards  recovery is dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
as of may   we would require approximately  million in cumulative future operating income to be generated at various times over approximately the next years to realize our net deferred tax assets 
based upon our projections  our current net operating loss  or nol  and tax credit carryforwards will be fully utilized before they expire 
we will evaluate the need for an increase in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis based on our cumulative results of operations in recent years and our anticipated results in future periods 
a significant negative factor in the evaluation is cumulative losses in recent years and we may reach that position during fiscal year the assessment of whether an increase in the valuation allowance is necessary will be made each quarter by considering all of the positive and negative evidence in existence at that time and  depending upon the nature and weighting of such evidence  a substantial increase in the valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods

income tax provision benefit years ended may  increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit the income tax provision for fiscal year was million  which consisted of federal  state and foreign income taxes and represented an effective tax rate of 
this rate differed from the us statutory rate due to the lack of tax benefits from foreign losses offset in part by research tax credits 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we determined  based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of million 
although we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required with respect to our domestic net operating loss carryforwards  deferred expenses and tax credit carryforwards  recovery is dependent on achieving the forecast of future operating income over a protracted period of time 
as of may   we required 
table of contents approximately million in cumulative future operating income to be generated at various times over approximately the next years to realize our net deferred tax assets 
based upon our results for fiscal year  it would take us less than years to utilize our current nol and tax credit carryforwards 
during this period our profits have also grown  which  if projected into the future  would result in utilization of current nol and tax credit carryforwards in an even shorter number of years 
we will continue to review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on an ongoing basis 
the trends include the expected continued growth of the smartphone market 
failure by us to achieve our future operating income targets or negative changes to expected trends may change the assessment regarding the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
any increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents as of may  were million  compared to million as of may   an increase of million 
we experienced an approximately million net decrease in cash flows from operations resulting from our net loss of million  which was partially offset by non cash charges of million and changes in assets and liabilities of million 
our cash increased due to net sales of short term investments of million  net proceeds from the sale of land of million  proceeds received from the sale of restricted investments and non current auction rate securities totaling million and million from stock related activity as a result of the exercise of stock options and other equity awards 
fluctuations in exchange rates during fiscal year for our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities resulted in an increase in cash flows of approximately million for fiscal year these increases were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million  the purchase of restricted investments of million  payments for the acquisition of a business of million  payments for the acquisition of intangible brand assets of million and debt repayments of million 
also  during fiscal year we completed the recapitalization transaction with elevation partners which resulted in net cash outflows of approximately million due to a million one time cash distribution partially funded by million received from incurring new debt and the issuance of preferred stock 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represent investments in pools of assets  including commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  credit linked notes and credit derivative products 
these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and  during fiscal year  auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to all of the ars investments were investment grade quality and were in compliance with our investment policy at the time of acquisition 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
during fiscal year  we reclassified the entire ars investment balance from short term investments to non current auction rate securities on our consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments and united states treasury securities 
historically  the fair value of ars investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 

table of contents we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of may  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of may  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  of which million was deemed temporary and million was recognized as a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge 
we review our impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in evaluating the impairment of any individual ars  we classified such impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  liquidity and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future quarters 
we continue to monitor the market for ars transactions and consider their impact if any on the fair value of our investments 
our short term investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relation to our investment guidelines and market conditions 
we have decided to modify the current investment strategy by limiting our investments in ars to our current holdings and increasing our investments in more liquid investments 
we anticipate our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of may  will satisfy our operational cash flow requirements for at least the next twelve months 
based on our current forecast  we do not anticipate any short term or long term cash deficiencies 
net accounts receivable was million as of may   a decrease of million  or  from million as of may  days sales outstanding  or dso  of receivables was days and days at may  and  respectively 
the decrease in net accounts receivable and the decrease in dso are primarily due to the decrease in our revenues during the last three months of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year coupled with a higher percentage of those revenues recorded in fiscal year later in the period as compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  the cash conversion cycle decreased day to days compared to days as of fiscal year end the cash conversion cycle is the duration between the purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash for the sale of our products and is an annual metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets 
in september  our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
the program allows repurchases of our shares at our discretion  depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 

table of contents the stock repurchase program is designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuance 
the program will be funded using our existing cash balance and future cash flows 
the share repurchases will occur through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions and or transactions structured through investment banking institutions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
during fiscal year  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock through open market purchases

we utilize contract manufacturers to build our products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information supplied by us  which typically covers a rolling month period 
consistent with industry practice  we acquire inventories from such manufacturers through blanket purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments typically cover our forecasted product requirements for periods ranging from to days 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and or adjust our requirements based on our business needs 
in some instances we also make commitments with component suppliers in order to secure availability of key components that may be in short supply 
consequently  only a portion of our purchase commitments arising from these agreements may be non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
as of may   our cancellable and non cancellable commitments to third party manufacturers and suppliers for their inventory on hand and component commitments related to the manufacture of our products were approximately million

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  the result of which partially offsets our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity investments we currently maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of cash equivalents and short term investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the objectives of our investment activities are to maintain the safety of principal  assure sufficient liquidity and achieve appropriate returns 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities and by limiting exposure to any one issuance or issuer 
we do not include derivative financial investments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million as of may  and  respectively  are primarily money market funds and an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  or would cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of our cash equivalents 
as of may  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months 
these available for sale investments include government  domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels as of may  would cause a decline of less than  or approximately million  in the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio 
a similar increase in market interest rates from levels as of may  would have resulted in a decline of less than  or million  in the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio as of may  we would expect our net income loss or cash flows to be similarly affected  in absolute dollars  by such a change in market interest rates

these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and  during fiscal year  auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to during fiscal year we reclassified our entire balance from short term investments to non current auction rate securities on our consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments and united states treasury securities 
as of may   we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  of which million was deemed temporary and million was recognized as a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would cause an additional decline of less than  or less than million  in the fair market value of our investments in ars 

table of contents debt obligation we have an outstanding variable rate term loan totaling million as of may  pursuant to the terms of the related credit agreement  which we entered into during fiscal year  we expect to make interest payments at libor plus

as of may   our interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit agreement was approximately 
a hypothetical basis point increase in this rate would have a resulting increase in interest expense of approximately million each year for every million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
foreign currency exchange risk we denominate our sales to certain international customers in the euro  in pounds sterling  in brazilian real and in swiss francs 
expenses and other transactions are also incurred in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the net gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities was a gain loss of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  and is included in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations
