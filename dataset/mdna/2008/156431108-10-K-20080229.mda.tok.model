item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reflects our historical results of operations  which do not include results from the  mtpy expansion capacity of grundartangi until it was completed in the fourth quarter of  and the  mtpy expansion of grundartangi until it was completed in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the results for fiscal years and are not fully comparable to the results of operations for fiscal year our historical results are not indicative of our current business 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
overview we produce primary aluminum 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by global supply and demand 
the key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows our selling price is based on the lme price of primary aluminum and is influenced by regional premiums and fixed price sales contracts 
our facilities operate at or near capacity  and fluctuations in volume  other than through acquisitions or expansion  generally are small 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are alumina  electrical power  labor and carbon products  which in aggregate were in excess of of the cost of goods sold 
many of these costs are covered by long term contracts 
shipment volumes  average realized price and cost of goods sold per pound shipped are our key performance indicators 
revenue can vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in the lme and midwest price of primary aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect shipment volumes or the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
our revenue is also impacted by our hedging activities 
fluctuations in working capital are influenced by shipments  the lme and midwest price of primary aluminum and by the timing of cash receipts from major customers and disbursements to our suppliers 

table of contents cost of goods sold  excluding alumina and certain energy costs  is expected to remain relatively stable because our facilities generally operate near capacity and our major cost drivers are subject to long term contracts 
fluctuations in the cost of alumina in our us facilities are expected as the pricing in these contracts is variable and  except for the gramercy alumina contract  based on lme prices 
power contracts for our us facilities primarily provide for fixed priced power through  subject to possible adjustments for fuel costs in mt 
holly and adjustments in tariff rates in ravenswood 
power contract pricing for nordural is variable and based on lme prices 
approximately of hawesville s power requirements mw are unpriced beginning in mid through we have negotiated short term contracts to cover most of this requirement through the first half of at approximately market prices 
we are working with big rivers electric corporation and kenergy corporation on a proposal that would restructure and extend hawesville s existing power supply contract from mid through the proposed new long term power contract was filed with the kentucky public service commission in late december the contract would provide all of hawesville s power requirements through at cost based pricing 
the parties involved expect the transaction to close late in the second quarter of we expect power rates for the of hawesville s requirements not covered by long term contracts to be higher than those under our current long term power contracts 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our statements of operations 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income loss on early extinguishment of debt other income expense net net loss on forward contracts loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of joint ventures income tax benefit loss before equity in earnings of joint ventures equity in earnings of joint ventures net loss the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the shipment volumes and the average sales price per pound shipped primary aluminum direct metric tons pounds pound toll metric tons pounds pound 
table of contents direct shipments do not include toll shipments from grundartangi 
grundartangi expansion capacity start up began in february annual production of  mtpy was reached in the fourth quarter of annual production of  mtpy was reached in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased million to  million 
higher price realizations for primary aluminum in the year ended december   due to improved lme prices for primary aluminum  contributed million to the sales increase 
additional net sales volume contributed million to the sales increase 
direct shipments increased million pounds from the same period in  primarily due to the temporary shutdown of a potline in august  and toll shipments increased million pounds from the same period in due to the grundartangi expansion capacity that has come on stream since september gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit increased million to million 
improved price realizations  net of lme based alumina and lme based power contract cost increases  improved gross profit by million 
increased shipment volume contributed million in additional gross profit 
partially offsetting these gains were million in net cost increases comprised of increased power costs at our us smelters  million  increased costs for maintenance  supplies and materials  million  increased costs for our non lme based alumina  million  increased net amortization and depreciation charges  primarily at grundartangi  million  and other cost increases  million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million 
approximately of the increase is due to spending on the proposed helguvik project  and the reminder of the increase is due primarily to compensation related expenses  outside professional support and expenses incurred for business development activities 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million 
the decrease in interest expense is due to the retirement of nordural s outstanding debt in and offset by lower interest capitalized on the grundartangi expansion during interest income interest income for the year ended december  increased by million to million 
the increased interest income is a result of higher average cash and short term investment balances during due to proceeds of the equity offering  improved operating results and reduced investing activities for the nordural expansion  offset by the repayment of nordural s outstanding debt 
net loss on forward contracts for the year ended december   the net loss on forward contracts was million compared to a net loss on forward contracts of million for the losses reported for the years ended december  and were primarily a result of mark to market losses associated with our long term financial sales contracts with glencore that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
cash settlement of financial sales contracts that do not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment accounted for million of the net loss and accounted for million of the net loss 
the remaining million in net loss for are unrealized losses related to our outstanding financial sales contracts that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting that are due for settlement in through  offset by a million gain for non cash settlements of physical delivery sales contracts that are accounted for as derivatives and marked to market 
tax provision the changes in the income tax provision were a result of changes in the level of earnings and losses within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in the current year s effective tax rate and a change in the west virginia tax law 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in to increase the carrying amount of deferred tax assets as a result of the west virginia tax law change 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased million or to  million 
higher price realizations for primary aluminum in  due to improved lme prices and midwest premiums  contributed million of the sales increase 
this amount was partially offset by a million decrease in direct shipment revenues 
direct shipments were million pounds less than the previous year due to the potline shutdown at ravenswood  offset by production increases at the other us smelters 
the additional revenue provided by the increase in grundartangi tolling shipments for the year ended december  contributed million to the net sales increase 
gross profit for the year ended december   gross profit increased million to million 
improved price realizations net of increased lme based alumina costs improved gross profit by million 
improved tolling fee realizations net of increased lme based power costs improved gross profit by million 
increased shipment volume  the result of the grundartangi expansion  contributed million in additional gross profit 
offsetting these gains were million in net cost increases comprised of higher power and natural gas costs  million  higher raw materials  supplies and maintenance costs  million  increased cost for gramercy alumina  million  restart and increased average costs due to the temporary potline shutdown at ravenswood  million  increased net amortization and depreciation charges  million  increased pension and other postemployment benefit accruals  million  and other increased spending  million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million relative to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased million to million 
the increase in interest expense is due to higher debt at nordural 
net loss on forward contracts for the year ended december   net loss on forward contracts was million compared to a net loss on forward contracts of million for the losses reported for the years ended december  and were primarily a result of mark to market losses associated with our long term financial sales contracts with glencore that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
cash settlements of financial metal sales contracts that do not qualify for cash flow hedge treatment accounted for million of the net loss  of which million loss is due to the non cash settlements of derivatives associated with the glencore metal agreements 
the remaining million is unrealized losses consisting of million unrealized losses related to our outstanding financial metals sales contracts that do not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges due for settlement in through  and million unrealized loss due to an embedded derivative in our ravenswood power contract 
tax provision we recorded an income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million  a reduction of million from the recorded tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the reduction in the tax benefit is due to the reduced loss before income taxes and increased equity in earnings of joint ventures 
equity in earnings of joint ventures equity in earnings from the gramercy and sabl investments improved to million for the year ended december  and million in these earnings represent our share of profits from third party bauxite  hydrate and chemical grade alumina sales 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe these sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our near term working capital needs 
we have not determined the sources of funding for our long term capital and debt repayment requirements  however  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available borrowing under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent necessary and or economically attractive  future financial market activities will be adequate to address our long term liquidity requirements 
our principal uses of cash are operating costs  settlement of our primary aluminum financial sales contracts  payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt  the funding of capital expenditures and investments in related businesses  working capital and other general corporate requirements 

table of contents our management believes the presentation of free cash flow is a useful measure that helps investors evaluate our capacity to fund ongoing cash operating requirements  including capital expenditures and debt service obligations  and to make acquisitions or other investments 
we define free cash flow as net cash used in provided by operating activities less capital expenditures other than capital expenditures related to the expansion of grundartangi and including the net increase in short term investments due to their liquidity 
our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components used in its calculation 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow from operating activities  which is the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap financial measure is provided below 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
reconciliation of cash flow from operations to free cash flow year ended december  net cash used in provided by operating activities increase in short term investments net purchase of property  plant and equipment free cash flow excludes capital expenditures for the grundartangi expansion 
as of december   we had a borrowing availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
we could issue up to a maximum of million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
any outstanding letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability on a dollar for dollar basis 
we have issued letters of credit totaling million and had no other outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  including million under our convertible senior notes  million under our senior notes and million under our industrial revenue bonds 
more information concerning the various debt instruments and our borrowing arrangements is available in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we are party to primary aluminum financial sales contracts with glencore 
in the event of a material adverse change in our creditworthiness  glencore has the option to require a letter of credit  or any other acceptable security or collateral  for the outstanding balances on these contracts 
capital resources capital expenditures for were million  million of which was related to the expansion projects at grundartangi  with the balance principally related to upgrading production equipment  improving facilities and complying with environmental requirements 
we expect to incur an additional million of capital expenditures for the completion of the grundartangi expansion project in we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in in addition  we expect to incur approximately to million in capital expenditures for the proposed helguvik greenfield project in we believe that we have access to financing adequate to complete the first two phases to a minimum capacity of  mtpy of the proposed helguvik plant through a combination of cash on hand  short term investments  grundartangi s cash from operations and borrowings under a new debt facility in iceland which we are presently negotiating 
our cost commitments for the proposed helguvik project may materially change depending on the exchange rate between the us dollar and certain foreign currencies  principally the euro and the icelandic krona 
in the past  we purchased foreign currency options to hedge our foreign currency risk in the icelandic krona associated with a portion of the capital expenditures from the grundartangi expansion project 
currently  we do not have any hedges for our exposure to foreign currency risk  but we will continue to evaluate our exposure and available hedging instruments and we may hedge our foreign currency exposure in the future 

table of contents historical our statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and are summarized below dollars in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities change in cash net cash used in operating activities in was million  which included a net million use of cash for the purchase of short term investments 
such investments generally yield higher returns than cash or other money market instruments 
if we had not used cash to purchase those investments  our net cash from operations would have increased due to improved price realizations and the additional shipment volume from grundartangi compared to the same period in see reconciliation of free cash flow above 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  a decrease of million from this decrease was due primarily to lower expenditures for the grundartangi expansion project 
net cash from operating activities of million in was million higher than the same period in this increase was a direct result of improved price realizations and the added margin contributions from the expansion capacity at nordural 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  a decrease of million from exclusive of the million proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment in and net acquisition cost of million for a southwire contingency payment in april  related to the hawesville acquisition in  the decrease was million 
this decrease was due primarily to lower expenditures on the grundartangi expansion project of million  offset by higher purchases of property  plant and equipment and restricted and other cash deposits during the year of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million 
we received million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our equity offering in june and the exercise of stock options 
we borrowed an additional million for the grundartangi expansion project 
this amount was offset by principal payments of million on nordural debt  which included million from the proceeds of the equity offering in june net cash provided by financing activities during was million  a decrease of million from the previous year 
during  we borrowed million under nordural s term loan facility and repaid million  consisting of payments of million for the repayment of the revolving credit facility and million for other miscellaneous debt payments 
we received proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and realized a million tax benefit from our share based compensation programs 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make judgments  assumptions and estimates in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by our management include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits  forward delivery contracts and financial instruments and the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 

table of contents pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities we sponsor several pension and other postemployment benefit plans 
our liabilities under these defined benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and health care inflation rate 
discount rate selection it is our policy to select a discount rate for purposes of measuring obligations under defined benefit plans by matching cash flows separately for each plan to yields on zero coupon bonds 
we use the citigroup pension liability index for determining these yields 
the citigroup pension liability index was specifically developed to meet the criteria set forth in sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the published information at the end of each calendar month includes spot rate yields zero coupon bond yield estimates in half year increments for use in tailoring a discount rate to a particular plan s projected benefit cash flows 
the citigroup pension liability index rate represents the discount rate developed from these spot rate yields  based on the pattern and duration of the benefit payments of a typical  large  somewhat mature pension plan 
the individual characteristics of each plan  including projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  have been taken into account  since discount rates are determined on a plan by plan basis 
we will generally select a discount rate rounded to the nearest  unless specific circumstances provide for a more appropriate non rounded rate to be used 
we believe the projected cash flows used to determine the citigroup pension liability index rate provide a good approximation of the timing and amounts of our defined benefits payments under our plans and no adjustment to the citigroup pension liability index rate has been made 
therefore  as of december   we selected a discount rate of for all our post employment benefit plans  except for our pension plan for hourly employees for which we selected a discount rate of 
a change of a half percentage point in the discount rate for our defined benefit plans would have the following effects on our obligations under these plans in effect of changes in the discount rates on the projected benefit obligations for basis point increase basis point decrease dollars in thousands pension plans other postemployment benefit opeb plans century provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of our us based operations 
sfas no 
requires the accrual of the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
we fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of our postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical estimates for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
century assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in 
table of contents one percent increase one percent decrease dollars in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation forward delivery contracts and financial instruments estimating the fair value of certain of our forward financial contracts requires us to make assumptions about future market prices of primary aluminum 
as part of our commodity price risk management activities  we enter into market priced fixed priced financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum in future periods 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in accounting for these types of contracts 
we have fixed price financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum with settlement dates through  but the current lme futures quote only provides pricing through determining the fair value of these forward contracts requires us to make certain assumptions about future market prices of primary aluminum beyond the quoted future market prices in the aluminum based financial contracts that are derivatives and do not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception  as provided for in current accounting standards  are marked to market using the lme spot and forward market for primary aluminum 
for derivative contracts extending beyond the quoted lme market periods  we estimate the forward lme market price beyond the quoted periods based upon market price trends in the final months of the quoted lme market 
fluctuations in the lme price of primary aluminum have a significant impact on gains and losses included in our financial statements from period to period 
unrealized gains and losses for these derivative instruments are included in net gain loss on forward contracts 
the principal contracts affected by these standards and the resulting effects on the financial statements are described in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
deferred income tax assets we regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will or may not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
when a valuation allowance is established or increased  an income tax charge is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly 
changes in the tax laws  statutory tax rates and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated  we would be required to write off the remaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision  resulting in a reduction of net income and shareholders equity 
in  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets in iceland following the preparation of long range financial projections for our operations 
we concluded that due to uncertainties related to certain tax positions in iceland and based on current circumstances  the deferred tax assets related to net tax operating loss carryforwards nols in iceland may not be realizable prior to their expiration 
as of december   we established a valuation allowance for those nols of million 
previously  we assessed that it was more likely than not that we would realize our nols through future projected taxable income 

table of contents environmental expenditures we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
the aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we believe that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations may change  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
we have planned environmental capital expenditures of approximately million for in addition  we expect to incur operating expenses relating to environmental matters of approximately to million each year during  and  respectively 
these amounts do not include any projected capital expenditures or operating expenses for our joint venture interests 
as part of our general capital expenditure plan  we also expect to incur capital expenditures for other capital projects that may  in addition to improving operations  reduce certain environmental impacts 
see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
other contingencies century s income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service irs for the tax years through in connection with such examinations  the irs has raised issues and proposed tax deficiencies 
we have reached a tentative agreement with the irs which is subject to final approval by the joint committee on taxation 
we expect that this agreement will be approved 
based on current information  we do not believe that the outcome of the tax audit will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in  we anticipate making a settlement payment of approximately million related to the irs examination 
we are a defendant in several actions relating to various aspects of our business 
while it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any litigation  we do not believe that any of these lawsuits  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

recently issued accounting standards information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in note of the consolidated financial statements included herein 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we have entered into various contractual obligations that will be settled in cash 
these obligations consist primarily of long term debt obligations and purchase obligations 
the expected future cash flows required to meet these obligations are shown in the table below 
more information is available about these contractual obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein

estimated interest payments on our long term debt are based on several assumptions  including an assumption that all outstanding debt instruments will remain outstanding until their respective due dates 
the irb interest rate is variable and our estimated future payments are based on a rate of 
purchase obligations include long term alumina  electrical power contracts and anode contracts 
nordural s power contracts and our domestic alumina contracts  except for our gramercy alumina contract  are priced as a percentage of the lme price of primary aluminum 
we assumed an lme price consistent with the lme forward market at december   decreasing to the year historical lme thereafter for purposes of calculating expected future cash flows for these contracts 
our gramercy long term alumina contract has variable cost based pricing 
we used cost forecasts to calculate the expected future cash flows for this contract 
a portion of certain nordural anode contracts are denominated in euros 
we assumed a euro conversion rate to estimate the obligations under these contracts 
includes the estimated benefit payments for our opeb obligations through  which are unfunded 
other liabilities include our expected serb benefit payments  workers compensation benefit payments  settlement payments and asset retirement obligations and uncertain tax positions 
expected benefit payments for the serb plans  which are unfunded  are included for through asset retirement obligations are estimated disposal costs for the potliner in service 
in  we anticipate paying approximately million related to an irs examination as discussed in the note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
as of december   the gross liability for uncertain tax positions under fin no 
is approximately million 
we expect to make a million payment to the irs related to a portion of these obligations within the next twelve months 
we have not included the remaining fin no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity we are exposed to price risk for primary aluminum 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum by selling aluminum at fixed prices for future delivery and through financial instruments  as well as by purchasing certain of our alumina and power requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts the lme price of primary aluminum 
our risk management activities do not include any trading or speculative transactions 
the following table shows our forward priced sales as a percentage of our estimated production capacity 
forward priced sales as of december  base volume pounds metric tons percent of estimated capacity potential additional volume pounds metric tons percent of estimated capacity the forward priced sales in exclude january shipments to customers that are priced based upon the prior month s market price 
certain financial contracts included in the forward priced sales base volume for the period through contain clauses that trigger potential additional sales volume when the market price for a contract month is above the base contract ceiling price 
these contacts will be settled monthly and  if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all remaining contract months through  the potential sales volume would be equivalent to the amounts shown 
apart from our long term primary aluminum sales contracts discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included herein the alcan metal agreement  glencore metal agreement i  glencore metal agreement ii and southwire metal agreement  we had forward delivery contracts to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively 
of these forward delivery contracts  we had fixed price commitments to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively  of which none were with glencore at december  or financial sales agreements to mitigate the volatility in our unpriced forward delivery contracts  we enter into fixed price financial sales contracts  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended delivery dates of the forward delivery contracts 
certain of these fixed price financial sales contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges depending on our designation of each contract at its inception 
glencore is our counterparty for all of these financial sales contracts 
the contracts accounted for as derivatives contain clauses that trigger additional shipment volume when the market price for a contract month is above the contract ceiling price 
if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all contract months through  the maximum additional shipment volume would be  metric tons 
these contracts are settled monthly 
we had no fixed price financial contracts to purchase aluminum at december  or december  
table of contents primary aluminum financial sales contracts as of metric tons december  december  cash flow hedges derivatives total cash flow hedges derivatives total total additionally  to mitigate the volatility of the natural gas markets  we enter into fixed price financial purchase contracts  accounted for as cash flow hedges  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended usage of natural gas 
natural gas financial purchase contracts as of thousands of mmbtu december  december  total on a hypothetical basis  a per metric ton increase in the market price of primary aluminum is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the contracts designated as cash flow hedges  and million on net income for the contracts designated as derivatives  for the period ended december  as a result of the forward primary aluminum financial sales contracts outstanding at december  on a hypothetical basis  a per mmbtu decrease in the market price of natural gas is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the period ended december  as a result of the forward natural gas financial purchase contracts outstanding at december  our metals and natural gas risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management 
these activities are regularly reported to century s board of directors 
this quantification of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum is necessarily limited  as it does not take into consideration our inventory or forward delivery contracts  or the offsetting impact on the sales price of primary aluminum products 
because all of our alumina contracts  except hawesville s alumina contract with gramercy  are indexed to the lme price for primary aluminum  they act as a natural hedge for approximately of our production 
as of december   approximately including  metric tons of potential additional volume under our derivative sales contracts of our production for was hedged by our lme based alumina contracts  nordural s electrical power and tolling contracts  and by fixed price forward delivery and financial sales contracts 
grundartangi 
substantially all of grundartangi s revenues are derived from toll conversion agreements with glencore  hydro and a subsidiary of bhp billiton ltd 
whereby grundartangi converts alumina provided by these companies into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
grundartangi s lme based toll revenues are subject to the risk of decreases in the market price of primary aluminum  however  grundartangi is not exposed to increases in the price for alumina  the principal raw material used in the production of primary aluminum 
in addition  under its power contract  grundartangi purchases power at a rate which is a percentage of the lme price for primary aluminum  providing grundartangi with a natural hedge against downswings in the market for primary aluminum 
grundartangi s tolling revenues include a premium based on the exemption available to icelandic aluminum producers from the eu import duty for primary aluminum 
in may  the eu members reduced the eu import duty for primary aluminum from six percent to three percent and agreed to review the new duty after three years 
this decrease in the eu import duty for primary aluminum negatively impacts grundartangi s revenues and further decreases would also have a negative impact on grundartangi s revenues 

table of contents grundartangi is exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro and the icelandic krona 
grundartangi s revenues and power costs are based on the lme price for primary aluminum  which is denominated in us dollars 
there is no currency risk associated with these contracts 
however  grundartangi s labor costs are denominated in icelandic krona and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros 
as a result  an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar would affect grundartangi s operating margins 
during  we entered into currency options to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure to the icelandic krona for the phase v expansion capital expenditures 
the option contracts  which are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no  had maturities through november the critical terms of the contracts matched those of the underlying exposure 
we did not have any outstanding foreign currency options outstanding as of december  subprime and related risks during  asset backed securities related to subprime consumer mortgages experienced a significant increase in expected default rates  resulting in a dramatic reduction in asset prices and market liquidity 
our exposure to these instruments is limited  but we continue to review this exposure 
at present  we believe our exposure is limited to assets in our pension plans that are invested in bond funds 
we are working with our pension fund trustee and we believe that approximately of our pension assets may be invested in various subprime investments 
the approximate value of these assets at december  was million 
we do not expect that any defaults would be material to our financial position or results from operation 
any defaults in these funds would lower our actual return on plan assets and increase the defined benefit plan net loss in other comprehensive income  and subsequently increase our pension expense as these losses are amortized over the service life of the participants 
at december   we had approximately million invested in variable rate demand notes vrdn 
these vrdns are tax exempt municipal bonds that are purchased from a remarketing agent 
we may tender the notes to the remarketing agent whenever the rates are reset  usually upon a seven day notice 
while the underlying securities are long term municipal bonds  the ability to tender the notes to the remarketing agent upon short notice provides liquidity 
there are two main risks associated with investments in vrdns 
the primary risk is that the remarketing agent may not be able to repurchase the notes  in which case we would have investments in long term municipal bonds and we would lose significant liquidity 
our remarketing agents have standby letters of credit and insurance to protect us against a failed tender 
the second risk is that the underlying securities default 
we invest in highly rated municipal bonds at december   our portfolio of investments was rated investment grade by standard poor s and we diversify our investment portfolio  a hypothetical default in our largest positions at december  would result in a loss of approximately million 
our primary financial instruments are cash and short term investments  including cash in bank accounts  other highly rated liquid money market investments and government securities which are classified as cash equivalents and short term investments  primarily variable rate demand notes  which are classified as short term investments
