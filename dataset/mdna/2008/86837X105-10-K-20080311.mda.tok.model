item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially form those anticipated in these forward looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth below under forward looking statements 
overview we are a delaware corporation formed in to serve as the parent holding company for an oilfield services business operating under the superior well services name since in many of the major oil and natural gas producing regions in the appalachian  mid continent  rocky mountain  southwest and southeast regions of the united states 
in august  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and in december we completed a follow on offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we provide a wide range of wellsite solutions to oil and natural gas companies  primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services 
we focus on offering technologically advanced equipment and services at competitive prices  which we believe allows us to successfully compete against both major oilfield services companies and smaller  independent service providers 
services offered we derive our revenue from two primary categories of services technical pumping services and down hole surveying services 
substantially all of our customers are domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that typically require both types of services in their operations 
our operating revenue from these operations  and their relative percentages of our total revenue  consisted of the following dollars in thousands year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue technical pumping services down hole surveying services total revenue the following is a brief description of our services technical pumping services we offer three types of technical pumping services stimulation  nitrogen and cementing which accounted for  and of our revenue for the year ended december  and  and of our revenue for the year ended december   respectively 
our fluid based stimulation services include fracturing and acidizing  which are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing zones 
in addition to our fluid based stimulation services  we also use nitrogen to stimulate wellbores 
our foam based nitrogen stimulation services accounted for substantially all of our total nitrogen services revenue in and our cementing services consist of blending high grade cement and water with various additives to create a cement slurry that is pumped through the well casing into the void between the casing and the bore hole 
once the slurry hardens  the cement isolates fluids and gases  which protects the casing from corrosion  holds the well casing in place and controls the well 
down hole surveying services we offer two types of down hole surveying services logging and perforating which collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenues for years ended december  and  respectively 
our logging services involve the gathering of down hole information through the use of specialized tools that are lowered into a wellbore from a truck 
an armored electro mechanical cable  or wireline  is used to 
table of contents transmit data to our surface computer that records various characteristics about the formation or zone to be produced 
we provide perforating services as the initial step of stimulation by lowering specialized tools and perforating guns into a wellbore by wireline 
the specialized tools transmit data to our surface computer to verify the integrity of the cement and position the perforating gun  which fires shaped explosive charges to penetrate the producing zone to create a short path between the oil or natural gas reservoir and the production tubing to enable the production of hydrocarbons 
in addition  we also perform workover services aimed at improving the production rate of existing oil and natural gas wells  including perforating new hydrocarbon bearing zones in a well once a deeper zone or formation has been depleted 
how we generate our revenue the majority of our customers are regional  independent oil and natural gas companies 
the primary factor influencing demand for our services by those customers is their level of drilling activity  which  in turn  depends primarily on current and anticipated future natural gas and crude oil commodity prices and production depletion rates 
we generate revenue from our technical pumping services and down hole surveying services by charging our customers a set up charge plus an hourly rate based on the type of equipment used 
the set up charges and hourly rates are determined by a competitive bid process and depend upon the type of service to be performed  the equipment and personnel required for the particular job and the market conditions in the region in which the service is performed 
each job is given a base time allotment of six hours 
we generally charge an increased hourly rate for each hour worked beyond the initial six hour base time allotment 
we also charge customers for the materials  such as stimulation fluids  cement and nitrogen  that we use in each job 
material charges include the cost of the materials plus a markup and are based on the actual quantity of materials used 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze the performance of our services 
these measurements include the following operating income per operating region  material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  and ebitda 
operating income per operating region 
we currently service customers in five operating regions through our service centers 
our appalachian region service centers are located in bradford  black lick and mercer  pennsylvania  wooster  ohio  kimball  buckhannon and jane lew  west virginia  norton  virginia  and gaylord  michigan 
our southeast region service centers are located in cottondale  alabama  columbia  mississippi  and bossier city  louisiana 
our mid continent region service centers are located in hominy  enid  clinton and cleveland  oklahoma  hays  kansas  and van buren  arkansas 
our rocky mountain region service centers are located in vernal  utah  farmington  new mexico  rock springs  wyoming  williston  north dakota  and trinidad and brighton  colorado 
our southwest region service centers are located in alvarado  texas and artesia  new mexico 
the operating income generated in each of our operating regions is an important part of our operational analysis 
we monitor operating income separately for each of our operating regions and analyze trends to determine our relative performance in each region 
our analysis enables us to more efficiently evaluate our utilization levels and allocate our equipment and field personnel among our various operating regions  as well as determine if we need to increase our marketing efforts in a particular region 
by comparing our operating income on an operating region basis  we can quickly identify market increases or decreases in the diverse geographic areas in which we operate 
it has been our experience that when we establish a new service center in a particular operating region  it may take from to months before that service center has a positive impact on the operating income that we generate in the relevant region 

table of contents material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue 
material and labor expenses are composed primarily of cost of materials  maintenance  fuel and the wages of our field personnel 
the cost of these expenses as a percentage of revenue has historically remained relatively stable for our established service centers 
our material costs primarily include the cost of inventory consumed while performing our stimulation  nitrogen and cementing services 
increases in our material and fuel costs are frequently passed on to our customers 
however  due to the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles  there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur an actual price increase until the time that we can pass on that increase to our customers 
our labor costs consist primarily of wages for our field personnel 
as a result of on going shortages of qualified supervision personnel and equipment operators  due to increased activity in the oilfield services and commercial trucking sectors  it is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract and train workers from other fields in order to maintain or expand our current work force 
historically  we have been able to increase service rates to our customers to compensate for wage rate increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a expenses  include fees for management services and administrative  marketing and maintenance employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our general and administrative expenses in relation to our revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the growth in operations  as well as a result of our becoming a public company 
for a discussion of the increase in costs associated with our public company status  please read items impacting comparability of our financial results public company expenses 
ebitda 
we define ebitda as net income before interest expense  income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  since it removes the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results  as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  to assess compliance with financial ratios and covenants included in credit facilities  in communications with lenders concerning our financial performance  and to evaluate the viability of potential acquisitions and overall rates of return 
how we manage our operations our management team uses a variety of tools to manage our operations 
these tools include monitoring service crew utilization and performance  equipment maintenance performance  customer satisfaction  and safety performance 
service crew performance 
we monitor our revenue on a per service crew basis to determine the relative performance of each of our crews 
we also measure our activity levels by the total number of jobs completed by each of our crews as well as by each of the trucks in our fleet 
we evaluate our crew and fleet utilization levels on a monthly basis  with full utilization deemed to be approximately jobs per month for each of our service crews and approximately jobs per month 
table of contents for each of our trucks 
by monitoring the relative performance of each of our service crews  we can more efficiently allocate our personnel and equipment to maximize our overall crew utilization 
equipment maintenance performance 
preventative maintenance on our equipment is an important factor in our profitability 
if our equipment is not maintained properly  our repair costs may increase and  during levels of high activity  our ability to operate efficiently could be significantly diminished due to having trucks and other equipment out of service 
our maintenance crews perform monthly inspections and preventative maintenance on each of our trucks and other mechanical equipment 
our management monitors the performance of our maintenance crews at each of our service centers by monitoring the level of maintenance expenses as a percentage of revenue 
a rising level of maintenance expenses as a percentage of revenue at a particular service center can be an early indication that our preventative maintenance schedule is not being followed 
in this situation  management can take corrective measures  such as adding additional maintenance personnel to a particular service center to help reduce maintenance expenses as well as ensure that maintenance issues do not interfere with operations 
customer satisfaction 
upon completion of each job  we encourage our customers to complete a pride in performance survey that gauges their satisfaction level 
the customer evaluates the performance of our service crew under various criteria and comments on their overall satisfaction level 
survey results give our management valuable information from which to identify performance issues and trends 
our management also uses the results of these surveys to evaluate our position relative to our competitors in the various markets in which we operate 
safety performance 
maintaining a strong safety record is a critical component of our operational success 
many of our larger customers have safety history standards we must satisfy before we can perform services for them 
we maintain an online safety database that our customers can access to review our historical safety record 
our management also uses this safety database to identify negative trends in operational incidents so that appropriate measures can be taken to maintain a positive safety history 
our industry and overview we provide products and services primarily to domestic onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production companies for use in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas 
the main factor influencing demand for well services in our industry is the level of drilling activity by oil and natural gas companies  which  in turn  depends largely on current and anticipated future natural gas and crude oil prices and production depletion rates 
current market indicators suggest an increasing demand for oil and natural gas coupled with a flat or declining production curve  which we believe should result in the continuation of historically high natural gas and crude oil commodity prices 
for example  the energy information administration of the us department of energy  or eia  forecasts that us oil and natural gas consumption will increase at an average annual rate of through the eia also forecasts that us oil production will decline at an average annual rate of and natural gas production will increase at an average annual rate of 
we anticipate that oil and natural gas exploration and production companies will continue to respond to sustained increases in demand by expanding their exploration and drilling activities and increasing capital spending 
in recent years  much of this expansion has focused on natural gas 
according to baker hughes rig count data  the average total rig count in the united states increased from in to  through the third week of february  while the average natural gas rig count increased from in to  through the third week of february while the number of rigs drilling for natural gas has increased by more than since  natural gas production has decreased by approximately over the same period of time 
this is largely a function of increasing decline rates for natural gas wells in the united states 
we believe that a continued increase in us drilling and workover activity will be required for the natural gas industry to help meet the expected increased demand for natural gas in the united states 

table of contents business outlook our overall business outlook remains positive and we believe that our activity levels will remain stable during although commodity prices and drilling activity remain at relatively high levels  we believe that increased competition due to capacity additions may continue to erode stimulation pricing in certain markets 
the new capacity entered the market in in response to strong demand and favorable margins for oilfield services 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced increased sales discounts in the low to mid single digits for our stimulation services 
we believe stimulation pricing declines may be partially offset over time by higher asset utilization levels as our newer service centers become more established in their respective markets  as well as improved activity levels if commodity prices and drilling activity levels remain at or near existing levels 
although we experienced increased sales discounts in our other service offerings during  they were less than those experienced in our stimulation business 
our growth strategy our growth strategy contemplates engaging in organic expansion opportunities and  to a lesser extent  complementary acquisitions of other oilfield services businesses 
our organic expansion activities generally consist of establishing service centers in new locations  including purchasing related equipment and hiring experienced local personnel 
historically  many of our customers have asked us to expand our operations into new regions that they enter 
once we establish a new service center  we seek to expand our operations by attracting new customers and hiring additional local personnel 
our revenues from each operating region  and their relative percentage of our total revenue  consisted of the following dollars in thousands percent of percent of percent of region revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue appalachian southeast southwest mid continent rocky mountain total we also pursue selected acquisitions of complementary businesses both in existing operating regions and in new geographic areas in which we do not currently operate 
in analyzing a particular acquisition  we consider the operational  financial and strategic benefits of the transaction 
our analysis includes the location of the business  strategic fit of the business in relation to our business strategy  expertise required to manage the business  capital required to integrate and maintain the business  the strength of the customer relationships associated with the business and the competitive environment of the area where the business is located 
from a financial perspective  we analyze the rate of return the business will generate under various scenarios  the comparative market parameters applicable to the business and the cash flow capabilities of the business 
to successfully execute our growth strategy  we will require access to capital on competitive terms to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations 
we intend to finance future acquisitions primarily by using capacity available under our bank credit facility and equity or debt offerings or a combination of both 
for a more detailed discussion of our capital resources  please read liquidity and capital resources 
our results of operations our results of operations are derived primarily by three interrelated variables market price for the services we provide  drilling activities of our customers  and cost of materials and labor 
to a large extent  the pricing environment for our services will dictate our level of profitability 
our pricing is also dependent upon the prices and market demand for oil and natural gas  which affect the level of demand for  and the pricing of  our services and 
table of contents fluctuates with changes in market and economic condition and other factors 
in recent months  increased capacity in certain of our operating regions has resulted in significant downward pricing pressure and increased discounts in our service prices 
we expect this downward pressure to continue in these regions until the level of activity increases to absorb the excess capacity or the amount of equipment and crews servicing these regions decreases through relocation to other regions with higher activity 
to a lesser extent  seasonality can affect our operations in the appalachian region and certain parts of the mid continent and rocky mountain regions  which may be subject to a brief period of diminished activity during spring thaw due to road restrictions 
as our operations have expanded in recent years into new operating regions in warmer climates  this brief period of diminished activity no longer has a significant impact on our overall results of operations 
our results of operations from our two primary categories of services consisted of the following for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in thousands statement of operations data revenue technical pumping services down hole surveying services total revenue expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative total expenses operating income fourth quarter results revenue

although we experienced increased sales discounts in our other service offerings during  they were less than those experienced in our stimulation business 
all regions  other than appalachia  experienced higher sales discounts in the fourth quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of in addition to higher sales discounts  longer holiday shut downs impacted activity levels for the fourth quarter of in each of our operating regions 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue was million  an increase of compared to million in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for fourth quarter of from for the fourth quarter of this percentage increase between periods was primarily the result of higher labor expense  depreciation and material costs as a percentage of revenue in fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenue  labor expense  depreciation and material costs increased in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of by  and  respectively 
as discussed above  delays experienced at our new centers resulted in higher start up costs in the fourth quarter of additionally  longer holiday shutdowns reduced utilization in each of our operating regions 
cost of revenues 
table of contents associated with the five start up service centers opened during increased fourth quarter expenses by million as compared to the fourth quarter of additionally  higher sales discounts lowered net revenues and resulted in an increase in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of labor expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of as a result of lower utilizations at new service centers established during  as well as longer holiday shutdowns 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we increased staffing and purchased additional equipment to begin servicing the marcellus shale activity in the appalachian region 
delays in receiving equipment and regulatory permits deferred revenue producing activities at the new service centers opened during the second half of  which lowered our utilization levels 
these delays postponed the opening of the clinton service center  which commenced operations during the third quarter of  and the brighton  artesia and rock springs service centers that were established in the fourth quarter of aggregate labor expenses included in cost of revenue increased million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of due to the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the establishment of new service centers and the expansion of existing service centers 
material costs as a percentage of revenues increased in the fourth quarter of to  an increase of compared to fourth quarter of higher sand transportation costs were the primary reason for the increase  as well as greater cement trucking costs for new service centers without bulk handling facilities 
delays in receiving regulatory and environmental approvals postponed the construction of bulk handling facilities at these new service centers  which resulted in additional trucking costs to transport cement from other service centers 
depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues was in fourth quarter of  an increase of compared to the fourth quarter of due to higher amounts of capital spending in  as well as lower utilizations at new service centers established during selling  general and administrative expenses

as a result of this growth  expenses for labor  office expenses and depreciation increased in the fourth quarter of by million  million and million  respectively  compared to the fourth quarter of the establishment of the five start up service centers in increased sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of by approximately million 
operating income 
operating income for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of compared to million in the fourth quarter of the five start up service centers established in reduced operating income in the fourth quarter of by million compared to the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenue  operating income decreased from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the primary reasons for this decrease were higher discounts for our services  costs incurred for the new service centers opened in  delays in opening new service centers and the increases in our cost of revenue and sg a expenses as described above 
these decreases were partially offset by increased drilling activity by our customers at our existing service centers 
it has been our experience that when we establish a new service center in a particular operating region  it may take from to months before that service center has a positive impact on the operating income that we generate in that region

items impacting comparability of our financial results changes in our legal structure 
prior to our initial public offering in august  our operations were conducted by two separate operating partnerships under common control  superior well services  ltd 
and bradford resources  ltd 
pursuant to a contribution agreement among superior well  inc and the former partners of these two operating partnerships  the operations of these two partnerships were combined under a holding company structure immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering 
in december  bradford resources  ltd 
was merged into superior well services  ltd 
superior well services  ltd 
is a pennsylvania limited partnership that became a wholly owned subsidiary of superior well services  inc in connection with its initial public common stock offering 
superior well services  inc serves as the parent holding company for this structure 
following the closing of the contribution agreement and our initial public offering as discussed in note to our historical consolidated financial statements  we began to report our results of operations and financial condition as a corporation on a consolidated basis  rather than as two operating partnerships on a combined basis 
prior to  we did not incur income taxes because our operations were conducted by two separate operating partnerships that were not subject to income tax 
in and prior  our historical combined financial statements of superior well services  ltd 
and bradford resources  ltd 
include a pro forma adjustment for income taxes calculated at the statutory rate resulting in a pro forma net income adjusted for income taxes 
prior to becoming a public company  partnership capital distributions were made to the former partners of our operating partnerships to fund the tax obligations resulting from the partners being taxed on their proportionate share of the partnerships taxable income 
as a consequence of our change in structure  we recorded a non cash adjustment of million to record the deferred tax asset and liabilities arising from the differences in the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities that existed at that time 
as of december   the net deferred tax liability was approximately million  resulting primarily from accelerated depreciation 
following our initial public offering  we incur income taxes under our new holding company structure  and our consolidated financial statements reflect the actual impact of income taxes 

table of contents public company expenses 
our general and administrative expenses have increased by approximately million to million per year as a result of becoming a public company following our initial public offering in these increases are due to the cost of tax return preparations  accounting support services  sarbanes oxley compliance expenses  filing annual and quarterly reports with the sec  investor relations  directors fees  directors and officers insurance and registrar and transfer agent fees 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the impact of these increased expenses and affect the comparability of our financial statements with periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering 
non cash compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
under this standard  companies are required to account for equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of additional compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r and its application to the restricted stock awards that we primarily granted in january and liquidity and capital resources prior to the completion of our initial public offering  cash generated from operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities and funds from partner contributions were our primary sources of liquidity 
following completion of our initial public offering  we have relied on cash generated from operations  public equity offerings and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of availability under our bank credit facilities which can be used for planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions 
financial condition and cash flows financial condition 
our working capital decreased million to million at december  compared to december   primarily due to a million decrease in cash as a result of our expenditures for property  plant and equipment that was partially offset by cash flow from operations 
additionally  higher revenue activities caused receivables and inventory to increase by million and million  respectively 
cash from operations was used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions totaling million in the increase in accounts receivable and inventory was due to the higher revenue activity discussed above in our results of operations 
offsetting the increase in current assets was an increase in accounts payable of million due to the higher revenue activity levels 
cash flows from operations 
our cash flow from operations increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to december   primarily due to higher income before income taxes 
for a detailed comparison of and operating results please see our results of operations under the sub heading year ended december  compared to year ended december  additionally  cash flow from operations increased due to higher amounts of deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by working capital changes that decreased cash flows from operations by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  working capital decreased cash flow from operations due to growth in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses that resulted from higher revenue activities 
additionally working capital decreased 
table of contents million due to the timing of payments made on accrued liabilities 
receivables and inventory increased and accrued liabilities decreased by million  million and million  respectively for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  deferred income taxes also increased in as compared to due to higher levels of tax depreciation in the current year 
cash flows used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher amounts of capital expenditures to acquire million of down hole surveying assets and million of equipment purchases for new and existing service centers 
during  goodwill and intangible assets increased by million due to down hole surveying asset acquisitions that occurred in cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  the net cash from financing activities was due to million in net proceeds from our follow on equity offering completed in december the net cash from financing activities was due to million in net borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
capital requirements the oilfield services business is capital intensive  requiring significant investment to expand and upgrade operations 
our capital requirements have consisted primarily of  and we anticipate will continue to be expansion capital expenditures  such as those to acquire additional equipment and other assets or upgrade existing equipment to grow our business  and maintenance or upgrade capital expenditures  which are capital expenditures made to extend the useful life of partially or fully depreciated assets or to maintain the operational capabilities of existing assets 
we continually monitor new advances in pumping equipment and down hole technology and commit capital funds to upgrade and purchase additional equipment to meet our customers needs 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of approximately million to purchase new and upgrade existing pumping and down hole surveying equipment 
the capital expenditure amounts include approximately million for down hole asset purchases and million of construction in progress for new capital equipment to be placed in service during these purchases and upgrades allow us to deploy additional service crews 
our capital expenditure budget is approximately million 
the decrease in the capital expenditure budget is due to fewer new service center planned openings in as compared to we plan to focus our planned capital expenditures budget on expanding our ability to service the marcellus shale activity in the appalachian region  as well as expanding our nitrogen and cementing capabilities in all of our operating regions 
given our objective of growth through organic expansions and selective acquisitions  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant amounts of capital to acquire businesses and assets 
we actively consider a variety of businesses and assets for potential acquisitions  although currently we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition 
for a discussion of the primary factors we consider in deciding whether to pursue a particular acquisition  please read our growth strategy 
management believes that cash flows from operations  combined with cash and cash equivalents and borrowing under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our routine operations and fund capital expenditures that are presently projected

accounting standards not yet adopted in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
it does not increase the use of fair value measurement 
sfas is effective for financial assets and liabilities in fiscal years beginning after november  and for non financial assets and liabilities in fiscal years beginning after march  we do not expect the provisions of the statement that apply to financial assets and liabilities to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the provisions applicable to non financial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
under sfas  companies that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
in addition  sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
sfas is effective beginning january  we do not expect it to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the loss of control of a subsidiary 
upon its adoption on january   noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the superior financial statements 
sfas also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring net income to include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest  with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income 
the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
the provisions of this standard must be applied retroactively upon adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas  however  we do not expect it to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  a replacement of sfas r 
this statement replaces sfas to establish accounting and reporting standards for business combinations in the first annual reporting period beginning after december  early adoption of this statement is prohibited 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
upon its adoption on january   noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the superior financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting standards have developed 
accounting standards generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve the implementation and interpretation of existing standards  and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable standards on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting standards are critical 
for further details on our accounting policies  please read note to the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is comprised principally of service revenue 
product sales represent approximately of total revenues 
services and products are generally sold based on fixed or determinable pricing agreements with the customer and generally do not include rights of return 
service revenue is recognized  net of discount  when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our services performed for customers are completed at the customer s site within one day 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the products are delivered to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
products are delivered and used by our customers in connection with the performance of our cementing services 
product sale prices are determined by published price lists provided to our customers 
accounts receivable are carried at the amount owed by customers 
we grant credit to all qualified customers  which are mainly regional  independent natural gas and oil companies 
management periodically reviews accounts receivable for credit risks resulting from changes in the financial condition of our customers 
once an account is deemed not to be collectible  the remaining balance is charged to the reserve account 

table of contents property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives range from to years for buildings and improvements and range from five to ten years for equipment and vehicles 
the estimated useful lives may be adversely impacted by technological advances  unusual wear or by accidents during usage 
management routinely monitors the condition of equipment 
historically  management has not changed the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment and presently does not anticipate any significant changes to those estimates 
repairs and maintenance costs  which do not extend the useful lives of the asset  are expensed in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate our long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the future estimated cash flows  which in most cases is derived from our performance of services 
the amount of future business is dependent in part on natural gas and crude oil prices 
projections of our future cash flows are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our services are located  the price of natural gas and crude oil  our ability to negotiate favorable sales arrangements  and our competition from other service providers 
we currently have not recorded any impairment of an asset 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 no amortization is recorded for goodwill and or intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for acquisitions completed after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and non amortizable assets be assessed annually for impairment 
we completed the annual impairment test for and no impairment was determined 
at december   our intangible assets consisted of million of goodwill and million of customer relationships and non compete agreements that are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from three to five years 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization expense of   and  respectively 
contingent liabilities we record expenses for legal  environmental and other contingent matters when a loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by governmental regulators and the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for 
table of contents these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
insurance expenses we partially self insure employee health insurance plan costs 
the estimated costs of claims under this self insurance program are accrued as the claims are incurred although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may subsequently be revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the self insurance accrual is estimated based upon our historical experience  as well as any known unpaid claims activity 
judgment is required to determine the appropriate accrual levels for claims incurred but not yet received and paid 
the accrual estimates are based primarily upon recent historical experience adjusted for employee headcount changes 
historically  the lag time between the occurrence of an insurance claim and the related payment has been approximately two months and the differences between estimates and actuals have not been material 
the estimates could be affected by actual claims being significantly different 
presently  we maintain an insurance policy that covers claims in excess of  per employee 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this standard  companies are required to account for equity based awards using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and include  and  of additional compensation expense  respectively  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we had no stock based compensation prior to impact of inflation inflation can affect the costs of fuel  raw materials and equipment that we purchase for use in our business 
we are generally able to pass along any cost increases to our customers  although due to pricing commitments and the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur a cost increase until the time we can pass it along to our customers 
most of superior s property and equipment was acquired in recent years  so recorded depreciation approximates depreciation based on current dollars 
management is of the opinion that inflation has not had a significant impact on our business 
forward looking statements and risk factors certain information contained in this annual report on form k including  without limitation  statements contained in part i  item business  part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and part ii  item a 
controls and procedures  as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us and our representatives in other reports  filings with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec  press releases  conferences  or otherwise  may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section le of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  and similar expressions  as they relate to us and our management  identify forward looking statements 
the actual results of future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  under the heading risk factors and elsewhere within this annual report on form k a decrease in domestic spending by the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry  a decline in or substantial volatility of natural gas and crude oil commodity prices  
table of contents overcapacity and competition in our industry  unanticipated costs  delays and other difficulties in executing our growth strategy  the loss of one or more significant customers  the loss of or interruption in operations of one or more key suppliers  the incurrence of significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from our failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment  and other financial  operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
to a lesser extent  we are also exposed to risks related to increases in the prices of fuel and raw materials consumed in performing our services 
we do not engage in commodity price hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our revolving credit facility established in october and our standby term loan facility established in august  each of which have variable interest rates based upon  at our option  libor or the prime lending rate 
the impact of a increase in interest rates on our outstanding debt as december  and december  would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income  of less than million and million annually  respectively 
concentration of credit risk 
substantially all of our customers are engaged in the oil and gas industry 
this concentration of customers may impact overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
two customers individually accounted for and and and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
one customer accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  eight customers accounted for  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   one customer accounted for and eight customers accounted for of our accounts receivable 
commodity price risk 
our fuel and material purchases expose us to commodity price risk 
our material costs primarily include the cost of inventory consumed while performing our stimulation  nitrogen and cementing services such as frac sand  cement and nitrogen 
our fuel costs consist primarily of diesel fuel used by our various trucks and other motorized equipment 
the prices for fuel and the raw materials in our inventory are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand  as well as market uncertainty and regional shortages 
although we are generally able to pass along price increases to our customers  due to pricing commitments and the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur a price increase until the time that we can pass it along to our customers
