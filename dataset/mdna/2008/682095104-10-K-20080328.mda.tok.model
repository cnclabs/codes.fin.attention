item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the sub caption commitments 
we were involved in a putative class action litigation filed in the clark county circuit court  in arkansas  alleging that our corrugated stainless steel tubing product  tracpipe and similar products manufactured by several other manufacturers also named as defendants in the case was defective against potential damage caused by nearby lightning strikes 
on september   we entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the class representatives and class counsel  to settle and resolve the allegations brought forth in the lawsuit 
we and the other defendants deny all of the allegations in the lawsuit  and deny any wrongdoing or legal liability  but agreed to settle this matter to avoid further cost and the uncertainty and risk of the outcome of further litigation 
a copy of the settlement agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the current report on form k that we filed with the securities and exchange commission on september   and is available on our website at www

the court gave final approval to the settlement agreement on february  the remedial program provided under the settlement agreement is currently processing claims from class members as provided under the settlement agreement 
the deadline for submitting such claims was september  we are currently engaged in a patent infringement case in which we have sued a flexible gas pipe competitor for infringement on one or more of our us patents covering our autoflare fittings 
we have alleged that the competitor has infringed on one or more of our patents covering the autoflare fittings by including certain patented features in the competitor s fitting  including a locator sleeve that makes it easier to align the connection 
the trial court has ruled that the competitor did infringe on one or more of our autoflare patents  and that the autoflare patents are valid 
an appeals court reversed the trial court s ruling on validity of our patent  and the case is scheduled for trial in may on the sole issue of whether our patent is valid under us patent law 
if the patent is upheld as being valid  then the damages due to omega flex have been previously determined 
in another case that was pending in the court of common pleas in chester county  pennsylvania  we sued a former employee and a flexible metal hose competitor to enjoin the disclosure of our trade secrets covering our proprietary rotary manufacturing process 
in this case  a former long term employee left our company to work for a competitor who is engaged in the flexible metal hose market 
the former employee had been involved in the development and or refinement of aspects of the rotary process manufacturing method  and had detailed knowledge of our trade secrets concerning this manufacturing method 
we filed suit to enjoin any disclosure of our trade secrets by the former employee to his new employer  to enforce certain terms of an employment agreement previously signed by the former employee  and to obtain damages for any unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our trade secrets 
the case went to trial in march  and the court issued its decision in july  ruling that our proprietary rotary process for manufacturing corrugated stainless steel tubing was a trade secret under pennsylvania law  and was to be accorded protection against unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation 
the defendants were permanently enjoined from disclosing the trade secrets  or using the trade secrets in their business 
at trial  we did not bring a claim for monetary damages  and no monetary damages were awarded by the court

the company s effective tax rate in approximates the rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates 
commitments and contingencies commitments on september  the company entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement with the class representatives and class counsel  to settle and resolve the allegations brought forth in the lawsuit titled lovelis  et al 
v 
titeflex corp  inc  et al 
in the arkansas circuit court  clark county 
all of the other defendants in the case also signed the settlement agreement 
the lawsuit related to allegations that the company s csst products posed an unreasonable risk of fire due to lightning strikes 
both the company and the other defendants denied these allegations  and denied any wrongdoing or legal liability  but agreed to settle this matter to avoid further cost and the uncertainty and risk of the outcome of further litigation 
the court gave final approval to the settlement agreement on february  and dismissed the case 
the remedial program provided under the settlement agreement processed claims from class members through the deadline of september  under the settlement agreement  the company has agreed to pay the value of each payment voucher redeemed by a class member for the installation of a lightning protection system or bonding and grounding of the company s csst product 
the amount of the voucher is dependent on the geographical area in the united states where the building is located and the size of the heated or air conditioned area of the building  as set forth in the settlement agreement 
the company also agreed to pay a fixed amount of administrative expenses in providing notice to the class  and establishing and operating a claim system under which class members may obtain information  submit claims  and have claims processed 
finally  the company agreed to pay attorneys fees to the class counsel to resolve this matter 
the company cannot determine the exact amount for which it may be liable for the costs of the payment vouchers tendered under the claim program  because of the number of unknown variables associated with this liability  including  the number of buildings in the united states that contain the company s csst product  the number of payment vouchers that are properly and timely submitted by claimants  the extent to which vouchers are for lightning protection systems or for bonding and grounding  the geographical location of the building within the united states  and the size of the building in which the csst is located 
however  the company estimated that the total amount of the liability relating to the settlement of the litigation would fall within a range of approximately  and  thus far the company has paid approximately  related to the settlement with a remaining liability of  allocated as a short term liability and  recorded as long term 
this amount is based on currently available information and certain estimates and judgments  and is subject to revision as actual claims are received  and a claim history is established 
in addition  there is a current liability for legal services related to the settlement 
as of december   the third party administrator of the settlement program has received claims relating to the company s products in connection with the settlement 
on february   the company reached an agreement for final payment relating to the class action settlement described in detail in note  commitments and contingencies 
this final payment  which was made on march   in the amount of  represents the  current portion due as previously disclosed  and the remaining  long term portion which was due in march of  less a reduction resulting from early payment 
the company s remaining obligations under the settlement relate only to the funding of claims made to the settlement administrator  which we have previously estimated at about under a number of indemnity agreements between the company and each of its officers and directors  the company has agreed to indemnify each of its officers and directors against any liability asserted against them in their capacity as an officer or director  or both 
the company s indemnity obligations under the indemnity agreements are subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in each of the agreements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is contingently liable for costs  which may be incurred by the officers and directors in connection with claims arising by reason of these individuals roles as officers and directors 
the company has entered into salary continuation agreements with two employees  which provide for monthly payments to each of the employee or his designated beneficiary upon the employee s retirement or death 
the payment benefits range from per month to per month with the term of such payments limited to years after the employee s retirement at age the agreements also provide for survivorship benefits if the employee dies before attaining age  and severance payments if the employee is terminated without cause  the amount of which is dependent on the length of company service at the date of termination 
the net present value of the retirement payments is included in other long term liabilities  which amounts to for december  and for december   respectively 
the company has obtained and is the beneficiary of three whole life insurance policies in respect of the two employees discussed above  and one other policy 
the cash surrender value of such policies included in other assets amounts to at december  and at december   respectively 
the company entered into a separation agreement and general release with duane e 
shooltz  formerly the general manager of the company s tracpipe business 
the agreement became effective on october  under the agreement  mr 
shooltz will receive  to be paid in equal weekly payments beginning on october  the company recorded a charge for the full in the fourth quarter of  relating to the separation agreement 
the company entered into a revolving line of credit note and a loan agreement with sovereign bank  na  whereby the company established a line of credit facility for a one year duration  and in the maximum amount of  the loan agreement provides for the payment of any loan under the agreement at a rate that is either the prime rate less  or libor rate plus 
as of december   the company does not have any loans or loan balances outstanding under the loan agreement 
contingencies the company retains significant obligations under its commercial insurance policies for losses occurring in the policy years in which it was a subsidiary of mestek  inc for the policy year ending october   the company retained liability for the first  per occurrence of commercial general liability claims including product liability claims  subject to an agreed aggregate 
in addition  for the company retained liability for the first per occurrence of workers compensation coverage  subject to an agreed aggregate 
however  for policy years beginning on july  the effective date of the spin off  the company retained liability for a maximum of per occurrence of commercial liability claims including products liability claims  subject to an agreed aggregate  and the company is insured on a first dollar basis for workers compensation subject to statutory limits 
prior to the spin off  the company self insured a substantial portion of the health benefits provided for its employees  and maintained reserves in this regard and relied upon a recognized actuarial consulting firm to help it set and maintain these reserves 
after the spin off  the company s liability is limited to per case and an aggregate of annually 
warranty commitments gas transmission products such as those made by the company carry potentially serious personal injury risks in the event of failures in the field 
as a result  the company has extensive internal testing and other quality control procedures and historically the company has not had a meaningful failure rate in the field due to the extensive nature of these quality controls 
due to the company s quality systems  the warranty expense is de minimis  and accordingly  the company does not maintain a warranty reserve beyond a nominal amount 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
historically low interest rates had contributed to strong residential construction activity in recent years 
significant increases in interest rates or reductions in residential construction activity for other reasons in future periods  however  could be expected to adversely affect the company s revenues  possibly materially 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe and counterstrike products are used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global warming phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company typically enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price range 
these agreements require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has no borrowing with any lending institutions and therefore has very little risk related to interest rate volatility 
interest rates are nonetheless significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry 
see construction activity  above 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers for whatever reason 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates all amounts in thousands financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable valuations  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  workers compensation claims reserves  health care claims reserves  and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe 
under generally accepted accounting principles  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist 
delivery has occurred or services rendered 
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable 
collection is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles 
gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the company 
this includes promotional incentives  year end rebates  and discounts 
the amounts of certain incentives are estimated at the time of sale 
commissions  for which the company receives an identifiable benefit  are accounted for as a sales expense 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years usage  measured on a historical usage basis  to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with fas  the company ceased recording amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  the company performed annual impairment tests in accordance with fas as of december  and december  which analyses indicated in all cases no impairment of goodwill 
product liability reserves as explained more fully under contingencies  the company retains liability for the first of product liability claims 
to date  the company has not experienced a meaningful product failure rate 
workers compensation claims reserves prior to the spin off  the company provided workers compensation coverage principally through commercial insurance carriers using high deductible programs  which required the company to reserve for and pay a high proportion of its workers compensation claims payable and relied upon the expertise of its insurance carriers and its own historical experience in setting the reserves related to these claims 
one such workers compensation claim is still outstanding from the pre spin off period for which the company remains liable for amounts up to the deductible 
the company maintains a reserve for these amounts 
the remaining potential liability is minimal  as this case is reaching the maximum deductible 
the company is insured on a first dollar basis 
health care claim reserves the company s liability is limited to per case and an aggregate of annually 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for federal tax liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method the company recorded tax expense and related deferred taxes and tax benefits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources all dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  as of december   we had  in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which is  less than at december  mostly resulting from cash payments during the first quarter of of  for a special dividend  and  related to the legal settlement discussed in note the decrease was partially offset by cash generated from earnings for the year 
operating activities cash provided by operations for was  compared with  in  a  decrease 
the most significant component was the  payment related to the legal settlement 
accounts receivable provided  for the twelve months ending december  compared to used during the twelve months of the decrease is predominately due to company applying approximately  of credits to customer s accounts in for promotional rebates earned in lieu of receiving a cash payment 
investing activities capital spending for the twelve months ended december  was capital spending in the twelve months ended december  was on september   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  of its common stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market and business conditions  within the next months 
the board retained the right to cancel extend  or expand the share buyback program  at any time and from time to time 
for all of  the company purchased  shares for financing cash used in financing activities during was  which was mostly related to the special dividend of  this is compared to  in when the company paid off the entire outstanding principal balance remaining on the company s main operating facility in exton  pennsylvania  as discussed in detail in note the company entered into a revolving line of credit note and a loan agreement with sovereign bank  na  whereby the company established a line of credit facility for a one year duration  and in the maximum amount of  the loan agreement provides for the payment of any loan under the agreement at a rate that is either prime rate less or libor rate plus as of december  the company does not have any loans or loan balances outstanding  under the loan agreement 
the company believes its liquidity position as of december  is fully adequate to meet foreseeable future needs and that the company will possess adequate cash reserves to meet its day to day needs including any acquisitions or capital expenditures or stock repurchases it can reasonably foresee at this time 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no
