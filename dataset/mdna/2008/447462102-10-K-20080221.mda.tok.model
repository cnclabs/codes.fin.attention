industry background we believe many organizations are facing increasingly large and complex business disputes and lawsuits  a growing number of regulatory and internal investigations and more intense public scrutiny 
concurrently  we believe increased competition and regulation are presenting significant operational and financial challenges for organizations 
distressed companies are responding to these challenges by restructuring and reorganizing their businesses and capital structures  while financially healthy organizations are striving to capitalize on opportunities by improving operations  reducing costs and enhancing revenue 
many organizations have limited dedicated resources to respond effectively to these challenges and opportunities 
consequently  we believe these organizations will increasingly seek to augment their internal resources with experienced independent consultants like us 
we believe the demand for our services is driven by the following factors sec and internal investigations 
the increased scrutiny of accounting practices  internal controls  and financial disclosures has contributed to a large number of financial restatements by public companies 
according to glass lewis co  an institutional investor advisory firm  companies with us listed securities filed  financial restatements in  up from what had been a record number in further  about one out of every ten public companies filed a restatement in  compared with one for every twelve in in response to a number of recent incidences of corporate malfeasance and accounting irregularities  the sec has conducted an increasing number of public company investigations over the past few years 
in fiscal year  the sec initiated investigations  civil actions  and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of issues  including financial fraud  abusive backdating of stock options  insider trading  violations by broker dealers  and fraud related to mutual funds 
for fiscal  the president s budget request for the sec is million  compared to the million funding level for the budget for the sec enforcement division  which has opened three dozen subprime mortgage related cases  would rise million to a total of million if the budget is adopted as proposed 
in addition  an increasing number of boards of directors  audit committees and special independent committees of companies that have had to review their historical financials or respond to complaints by whistleblowers have conducted internal forensic investigations to determine the underlying facts 
these dynamics have driven demand for independent financial consultants like us who help clients respond to sec investigations  evaluate restatements of financial statements and support internal investigations by combining investigative accounting and financial reporting skills with business and practical experience 
healthcare investigations 
as healthcare expenditures continue to grow in the united states  the industry faces greater pressure to reduce healthcare spending  particularly as it relates to publicly funded programs 
the pressure to stem the tide of cost growth has resulted in a significant increase in investigations driven by whistleblowers  government audits  and individual complaints 
the department of 
table of contents health and human services office of inspector general reported total fiscal year savings and expected recoveries of billion  billion more than the year before and more than double the savings and recoveries of just five years ago 
often times  these government investigations lead to follow on class action lawsuits by commercial payors 
litigation and disputes 
litigation and business disputes are prevalent in the united states and  we believe  the volume of this activity does not necessarily correlate with the economic cycle 
the breadth and magnitude of these matters is increasing 
for example  antitrust investigation and enforcement activities by federal  state and local authorities present heightened complexities and risks for companies in the areas of mergers and acquisitions  pricing policies  distribution relationships and patent and intellectual property matters 
in addition  private parties can bring antitrust claims asserting a variety of violations 
in its third annual litigation trends survey  fulbright jaworski llp polled in house law departments worldwide and found that for us companies with billion or more in annual revenues  the number of lawsuits soared to cases  with almost half facing new suits annually 
further  these companies spent an annual average of million on all their legal matters 
in complex litigation and disputes  organizations and the law firms that represent them regularly engage experienced consultants to provide or support expert testimony or perform data analyses involving financial  economic and accounting issues 
sarbanes oxley and stockholder activism 
the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of has substantially limited the scope of non audit services that large public accounting firms  such as the big four  can provide to their audit clients 
these limitations represent a significant opportunity for independent consulting firms 
further  certain influential institutional investors  citing concerns over perceived conflicts of interest  have opposed the ratification of auditors and the election of directors of companies that engage their auditors to perform permissible non audit services 
the restrictions of sarbanes oxley  stockholder opposition to auditors performing consulting services for their audit clients  and the relatively small number of large public accounting firms has led many clients to choose independent consulting firms over the big four when seeking providers of various consulting services 
operational challenges and opportunities 
organizations must constantly re evaluate business processes in order to manage change and risk  and minimize or recover costs 
for example  in the healthcare industry  the steady flow of changes that affect healthcare funding  treatments  delivery and administration increase the difficulty in managing a complex mix of factors  including rising healthcare costs and insurance premiums and the increasing number of uninsured citizens 
in the higher education industry  research universities and academic medical centers must develop and maintain programs to effectively manage research compliance risks and implement systems that support the recovery of research costs 
additionally  the difficulties of managing a large number of legal matters prompted in house legal departments to seek ways to improve their efficiency and effectiveness  which drives the demand for consultants specializing in legal department operations 
the changes to the federal rules of civil procedure and the interpretation and adoption by the states of the civil procedure rules have compelled corporations and their outside counsel to be in command of their obligations in responding to discovery much earlier in the process 
the demand for consultants to assist them with the technical  business and process challenges associated with the new rules and electronic discovery has never been greater 
in general  a variety of organizations seek to improve their procurement efficiencies  improve operational processes and reduce costs 
we believe that in seeking to meet these challenges and capitalize on these opportunities  organizations will increasingly augment their internal resources with consultants who can provide a combination of industry expertise and strong technical skills 
merger and acquisition activity 
despite depressed levels in recent years  there was a rebound in mergers and acquisitions activity  or m a  in the marketplace 
according to mergers acquisitions insights  published by piper jaffray company  despite the credit crunch that has curtailed dealmaking for large buyouts since mid  m a activity in the us continues to be strong 
through the first nine months of  m a activity  as measured by the number of transactions with us targets  increased over the same period in further  the total value of transactions through the third quarter of was trillion  more than the billion in transaction value over the same period in over the past ten years  the number of transactions has averaged approximately  per year with a 
table of contents combined average annual value of approximately trillion 
annual transaction value in is projected to greatly exceed the year average 
we believe m a activity creates demand for financial consulting services  such as purchase price allocations and other similar valuation services and dispute and litigation services  as well as operational consulting services  such as merger integration  margin improvement and strategic sourcing 
financial distress 
despite the decline in corporate bankruptcy filings  we believe there will continue to be a sufficient number of bankruptcies of the size and complexity that typically require debtors and other constituents to retain the services of financial advisors 
additionally  there is an ongoing need for restructuring and turnaround consulting services to assist financially distressed  under performing and debt laden companies and their stakeholders outside of the bankruptcy process 
further  the subprime mortgage world is under tremendous pressure 
in march of  the mortgage bankers association announced that percent of subprime loans are delinquent and greater than two percent of subprime loans had foreclosure proceedings launched in the fourth quarter of alone 
the recent news surrounding improperly managed subprime mortgages  which has in some cases forced bankruptcy  requires that companies carefully evaluate risks immediately to determine an appropriate course of action 
we believe that subprime lenders in particular  and many lenders in general  will need to modify their lending strategy in this fast changing market to appropriately consider the risks of a borrower s ability to repay their loans 
strategy 
according to kennedy information  a leading source of research reports  analysis and trends for the consulting marketplace  the client drive for profitable growth and the traction for newer services have placed strategy back at the forefront of clients minds 
in recent years  strategy consulting returned to strong growth after a sharp depression in kennedy expects the strategy market to continue to be strong in the upcoming years and to maintain a growth trajectory between and going forward 
strategy consulting is expected to grow faster than the overall management consulting market  outpacing the growth of operations management  information technology  and human resources consulting service lines 
employees our ability to bring the right expertise together to address client issues requires a willingness to work and think outside the bounds of a single practice or specialty 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals by creating a work environment where both individuals and teams thrive and individuals are rewarded not only for their own contributions but also for the success of our organization as a whole 
to accomplish those goals and recognize performance  we have adopted a comprehensive rewards program incorporating compensation  training and development opportunities  performance management and special recognition plans that motivates individual performance and promotes teamwork 
as of december   we had  full time employees  consisting of  full time revenue generating professionals and non revenue generating professionals 
the  revenue generating professionals consisted of managing directors and  directors  managers  associates  analysts and assistants 
many of these individuals have master s degrees in business administration  have doctorates in economics  are certified public accountants  or are accredited valuation specialists and forensic accountants 
our revenue generating managing directors serve clients as advisors and engagement team leaders  originate revenue through new and existing client relationships  and work to strengthen our intellectual capital  develop our people and enhance our reputation 
our directors and managers manage day to day client relationships and oversee the delivery and overall quality of our work product 
our associates and analysts gather and organize data  conduct detailed analyses and prepare presentations that synthesize and distill information to support recommendations we deliver to clients 
our non revenue generating professionals at december  consisted of managing directors and directors  managers  associates  analysts and assistants 
our non revenue generating professionals include our senior management team  senior client relationship managers  and finance  human resources  information technology  legal and marketing personnel 

table of contents in addition to our full time professionals  we have a roster of highly credentialed variable  on demand consultants and contract reviewers 
we utilize these variable resources extensively  particularly within our financial consulting and legal consulting segments 
we assimilate and support employees in their career progression through training and development programs 
we have structured orientation and training programs for new analysts  milestone programs to help recently promoted employees quickly become effective in their new roles  and opportunities for self directed training  including both on line and live technical and consulting courses 
we also support the pursuit and ongoing maintenance of many certifications 
employees are assigned internal performance coaches to identify opportunities for development  formal training or certifications 
our compensation plan includes competitive base salary  incentives and benefits 
under our incentive plan  directors  managers  associates and analysts set goals each year with a performance coach 
these goals are aligned with our business goals as well as individual interests and development needs 
managing directors set goals with their practice leader using a balanced scorecard 
the incentive plan balances our value of teamwork with recognition of individual performance  and incentive compensation is tied to both team and individual performance 
incentives for managing directors are based on their individual performance and their contribution to their practice and to our business as a whole 
funding of the incentive pool is based on our achievement of annual financial goals and each practice s achievement of its financial goals 
in addition  managing directors may receive long term equity incentives 
business development and marketing our business development activities aim to build relationships and a strong brand reputation with key sources of business and referrals  especially top tier law firms and the offices of the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and general counsel of organizations 
we believe that excellent service delivery to clients is critical to building relationships and our brand reputation  and we emphasize the importance of client service to all of our employees 
we generate most of our new business opportunities through relationships that our managing directors have with individuals working in corporations  academic institutions  healthcare organizations  and top tier law firms 
we also view cross selling as a key component in building our business 
often  the client relationship of a managing director in one practice leads to opportunities in another practice 
although some managing directors spend more time on service delivery than new business development  all of our managing directors understand their role in ongoing relationship and business development  which is reinforced through our compensation and incentive programs 
we actively seek to identify new business opportunities  and we frequently receive referrals and repeat business from past and current clients and from the law firms with which we have worked 
in addition  to complement the business development efforts of our managing directors  we have a group of senior client relationship managers who are focused exclusively on developing client relationships and generating new business through their extensive network of contacts 
we also host  participate and sponsor conferences that facilitate client development opportunities and promote brand recognition 
for example  during  we hosted such events as the summit gc  the unstructured records and information management roundtable  and the inaugural ecrt users meeting 
additionally  we participated and or sponsored numerous conferences for organizations such as national council of university research administrators ncura  turnaround management association tma  financial executive institute fei  center for business intelligence cbi  association for corporate growth acg  and healthcare financial management association hfma 
these events provided a forum to build and strengthen client relationships  as well as to stay abreast of industry trends and developments 
we have a centralized marketing department with a marketing professional assigned to each of our practices 
these professionals coordinate traditional marketing programs  such as participation in seminars  sponsorship of client events  and publication of articles in industry publications to actively promote our name and capabilities 
the marketing department also manages the content delivery on huron s website  develops collateral materials  performs research and provides database management to support sales efforts 

table of contents competition the consulting services industry is extremely competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
the industry includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including other business operations and financial consulting firms  general management consulting firms  the consulting practices of major accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and the internal professional resources of organizations 
we compete with a large number of service providers in all of our segments 
our competitors often vary depending on the particular practice area 
in addition  we also expect to continue to face competition from new entrants because the barriers to entry into consulting services are relatively low 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our market include firm and consultant reputations  client and law firm relationships and referrals  the ability to attract and retain top professionals  the ability to manage engagements effectively and the ability to be responsive and provide high quality services 
there is also competition on price  although to a lesser extent due to the critical nature of many of the issues that the types of services we offer address 
many of our competitors have a greater geographic footprint  including a broader international presence  and name recognition  as well as have significantly greater personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we believe that our experience  reputation  industry focus  and a broad range and balanced portfolio of service offerings enable us to compete favorably and effectively in the consulting marketplace

risk factors 
an inability to retain our senior management team and other managing directors would be detrimental to the success of our business 
we rely heavily on our senior management team  including gary holdren  our chief executive officer  daniel broadhurst  our vice president and chief operating officer  gary burge  our chief financial officer and treasurer  our practice leaders  and other managing directors  and our ability to retain them is particularly important to our future success 
given the highly specialized nature of our services  the senior management team must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage an organization consisting of a diverse group of professionals 
in addition  we rely on our senior management team and other managing directors to generate and market our business 
further  in light of our limited operating history  our senior management s and other managing directors personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
although we enter into non solicitation agreements with our senior management team and other managing directors  we generally do not enter into non competition agreements 
accordingly  members of our senior management team and our other managing directors are not contractually prohibited from leaving or joining one of our competitors  and some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our other managing directors leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in securing and successfully completing engagements and managing our business properly  which could harm our business prospects and results of operations 
our inability to hire and retain talented people in an industry where there is great competition for talent could have a serious negative effect on our prospects and results of operations 
our business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor intensive 
our success depends largely on our general ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled professionals 
the loss of a significant number of our professionals or the inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain additional skilled 
table of contents personnel could have a serious negative effect on us  including our ability to manage  staff and successfully complete our existing engagements and obtain new engagements 
qualified professionals are in great demand  and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience 
our principal competition for talent comes from other consulting firms  accounting firms and technical and economic advisory firms  as well as from organizations seeking to staff their internal professional positions 
many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
therefore  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled consultants we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
increasing competition for these revenue generating professionals may also significantly increase our labor costs  which could negatively affect our margins and results of operations 
our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult 
we have a limited operating history and although we generated net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  we may not sustain profitability in the future 
to sustain profitability  we must attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified professionals  achieve and maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our revenue generating professionals  expand our existing relationships with our clients and identify new clients in need of our services  maintain and enhance our brand recognition  and adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments 
we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives 
further  our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in highly competitive industries 
the historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance 
for example  we expect that our future annual growth rate in revenues will moderate and likely be less than the growth rates experienced in the early part of our history 
if we are unable to manage the growth of our business successfully  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have grown significantly since we commenced operations  increasing the number of our revenue generating professionals from as of may  to  as of december  as we continue to increase the number of our employees  we may not be able to successfully manage a significantly larger workforce 
additionally  our considerable growth has placed demands on our management and our internal systems  procedures and controls and will continue to do so in the future 
to successfully manage growth  we must add administrative staff and periodically update and strengthen our operating  financial  accounting and other systems  procedures and controls  which will increase our costs and may adversely affect our gross profits and our ability to sustain profitability if we do not generate increased revenues to offset the costs 
this need to augment our support infrastructure due to growth is compounded by our decision to become a public reporting company and the increased expense that has arisen in complying with existing and new regulatory requirements 
as a public company  our information and control systems must enable us to prepare accurate and timely financial information and other required disclosure 
if we discover deficiencies in our existing information and control systems that impede our ability to satisfy our reporting requirements  we must successfully implement improvements to those systems in an efficient and timely manner 

table of contents our financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our revenue generating professionals 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of our professionals 
utilization of our professionals is affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of client engagements  the timing of the commencement  completion and termination of engagements  which in many cases is unpredictable  our ability to transition our consultants efficiently from completed engagements to new engagements  the hiring of additional consultants because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate  unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of consultants  and conditions affecting the industries in which we practice as well as general economic conditions 
the billing rates of our consultants that we are able to charge are also affected by a number of factors  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  the market demand for the services we provide  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors  and general economic conditions 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants  our financial results could materially suffer 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of clients  and our engagement agreements  including those related to our largest clients  can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty  which may cause our operating results to be unpredictable 
as a consulting firm  we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
our ten largest clients accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our revenues in revenues from one client accounted for of our revenues in while revenues from another client accounted for of our revenues in our clients typically retain us on an engagement by engagement basis  rather than under fixed term contracts  the volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period 
moreover  a large portion of our new engagements comes from existing clients 
accordingly  the failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues we generate 
in addition  almost all of our engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation were to be settled  our engagement for those services would no longer be necessary and  therefore  would be terminated 
in client engagements that involve multiple engagements or stages  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
for clients in bankruptcy  a bankruptcy court could elect not to retain our interim management consultants  terminate 
table of contents our retention  require us to reduce our fees for the duration of an engagement  or approve claims against fees earned by us prior to or after the bankruptcy filing 
for example  shortly after we acquired speltz weis llc  its largest client  which accounted for approximately of its revenues and which accounted for approximately million  or  of our revenues in the year ended december   filed for bankruptcy 
while the bankruptcy court approved our retention  it did so subject to certain fee reductions that we negotiated with the client and certain other interested parties 
depending on the outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding  we may not receive the full amount of these negotiated amounts 
terminations of engagements  cancellations of portions of the project plan  delays in the work schedule or reductions in fees could result from factors unrelated to our services 
when engagements are terminated or reduced  we lose the associated future revenues  and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to minimize the negative impact 
in addition  our clients ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results in any particular fiscal period 
our ability to maintain and attract new business depends upon our reputation  the professional reputation of our revenue generating employees and the quality of our services 
as a professional services firm  our ability to secure new engagements depends heavily upon our reputation and the individual reputations of our professionals 
any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our employees  including not meeting client expectations or misconduct by our employees  could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new engagements and clients 
similarly  because we obtain many of our new engagements from former or current clients or from referrals by those clients or by law firms that we have worked with in the past  any client that questions the quality of our work or that of our consultants could impair our ability to secure additional new engagements and clients 
the consulting services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the consulting services industry in which we operate includes a large number of participants and is intensely competitive 
we face competition from other business operations and financial consulting firms  general management consulting firms  the consulting practices of major accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and the internal professional resources of organizations 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry  we expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the business operations and financial consulting industries 
many of our competitors have a greater national and international presence  as well as have significantly greater personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources 
in addition  these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do 
our ability to compete also depends in part on the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate skilled professionals  the price at which others offer comparable services and our competitors responsiveness to their clients 
if we are unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors  our financial results will be adversely affected 
additional hiring and business acquisitions could disrupt our operations  increase our costs or otherwise harm our business 
our business strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to grow by hiring individuals or groups of individuals and by acquiring complementary businesses 
however  we may be unable to identify  hire  acquire or successfully integrate new employees and acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial obstacles 
competition for future hiring and acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the compensation we offer to potential employees or the prices we pay for businesses we wish to acquire 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational and other benefits we anticipate from any hiring or acquisition  including those we have completed so far 
hiring additional employees or acquiring businesses could also involve a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company  the failure to retain key acquired personnel  
table of contents the adverse short term effects on reported operating results from the amortization or write off of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  such as described in management s discussion and analysis client bankruptcy case  potential impairment of existing relationships with our clients  such as client satisfaction or performance problems  whether as a result of integration or management difficulties or otherwise  the creation of conflicts of interest that require us to decline or resign from engagements that we otherwise could have accepted  the potential need to raise significant amounts of capital to finance a transaction or the potential issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to our existing stockholders  increased costs to improve  coordinate or integrate managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  the usage of earn outs based on the future performance of our business acquisitions may deter the acquired company from fully integrating into our existing business  a decision not to fully integrate an acquired business may lead to the perception of inequalities if different groups of employees are eligible for different benefits and incentives or are subject to different policies and programs  and difficulties in integrating diverse backgrounds and experiences of consultants  including if we experience a transition period for newly hired consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rates or margins 
if we fail to successfully address these risks  our ability to compete may be impaired 
the profitability of our fixed fee engagements with clients may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 
when making proposals for fixed fee engagements  we estimate the costs and timing for completing the engagements 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and consultants as we plan to deploy them on engagements 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed fee engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 
for the years ended december   and  fixed fee engagements represented  and respectively  of our revenues 
the percentage of fixed fee engagements in our health and education consulting segment has grown from in to in the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of wellspring  which has a larger percentage of fixed fee engagements 
revenues from our performance based engagements are difficult to predict  and the timing and extent of recovery of our costs is uncertain 
from time to time  we enter into engagement agreements under which our fees include a significant performance based component 
performance based fees are contingent on the achievement of specific measures  such as our clients meeting cost saving or other contractually defined goals 
the achievement of these contractually defined goals is often impacted by factors outside of our control  such as the actions of our client or third parties 
because performance based fees are contingent  revenues on such engagements  which are recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met  are not certain and the timing of receipt is difficult to predict and may not occur evenly throughout the year 
while performance based fees comprised only  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  we intend to continue to enter into performance based fee arrangements and these engagements may impact our revenues to a greater extent in the future 
should performance based fee arrangements represent a greater percentage of our 
table of contents business in the future  we may experience increased volatility in our working capital requirements and greater variations in our quarter to quarter results  which could affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  an increase in the proportion of performance based fee arrangements may temporarily offset the positive effect on our operating results from increases in our utilization rate or average billing rate per hour 
conflicts of interest could preclude us from accepting engagements thereby causing decreased utilization and revenues 
we provide services in connection with bankruptcy proceedings and litigation proceedings that usually involve sensitive client information and frequently are adversarial 
in connection with bankruptcy proceedings  we are required by law to be disinterested and may not be able to provide multiple services to a particular client 
in litigation we would generally be prohibited from performing services in the same litigation for the party adverse to our client 
in addition  our engagement agreement with a client or other business reasons may preclude us from accepting engagements with our clients competitors or adversaries 
as we increase the size of our operations and the complement of consulting services  the number of conflict situations will continue to increase 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide services  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  our consultants may become underutilized  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods 
expanding our service offerings or number of offices may not be profitable 
we may choose to develop new service offerings or open new offices because of market opportunities or client demands 
developing new service offerings involves inherent risks  including our inability to estimate demand for the new service offerings  competition from more established market participants  a lack of market understanding  and unanticipated expenses to recruit and hire qualified consultants and to market our new service offerings 
in addition  expanding into new geographic areas and or expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market 
for example  in august  we established a small office in palo alto  california to service the silicon valley marketplace and  in september  we established a small office in miami  florida to deepen our corporate finance capabilities 
these offices did not meet our expectations and  therefore  we subsequently closed those offices and incurred a restructuring charge of million in also in  we decided to eliminate a service offering of a practice area in our operational consulting segment that was not meeting our expectations and incurred a restructuring charge of million 
if we cannot manage the risks associated with new service offerings or new locations effectively  we are unlikely to be successful in these efforts  which could harm our ability to sustain profitability and our business prospects 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and hurt our reputation 
our engagements typically involve complex analyses and the exercise of professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
if a client questions the quality of our work  the client could threaten or bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities and  regardless of outcome  is often very costly  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we are not always able to include provisions in our engagement agreements that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services 
even if these limiting provisions are included in an engagement agreement  they may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances 
in addition  we carry 
table of contents professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims  but the policy limits and the breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of legal defense 
for example  we provide services on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
our intellectual property rights in our huron consulting group name are important  and any inability to use that name could negatively impact our ability to build brand identity 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the huron consulting group name is important to our business 
we are  however  aware of a number of other companies that use names containing huron 
there could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have trade name or service mark rights that are senior to ours 
if another company were to successfully challenge our right to use our name  or if we were unable to prevent a competitor from using a name that is similar to our name  our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted 
as a holding company  we are totally dependent on distributions from our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or other obligations and there may also be other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends in the future 
we are a holding company with no business operations 
our only significant asset is the outstanding equity interests of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
as a result  we must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
accordingly  although we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future  our subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us in order to allow us to pay future dividends on  or make any distribution with respect to  our common stock 
our future credit facilities  other future debt obligations and statutory provisions may also limit our ability to pay dividends or make any distribution in respect of our common stock

revenues a large portion of our revenues is generated by our full time billable consultants who provide consulting services to our clients and are billable to our clients based on the number of hours they worked 
a smaller portion of our revenues is generated by our other professionals  consisting of variable  on demand finance and accounting consultants and specialized operational consultants 
our other professionals also include our document review and electronic data discovery groups who utilize contract reviewers and information technology professionals 
our document review and electronic data discovery groups generate revenues primarily based on number of hours worked and units produced  such as pages reviewed or data processed 
we refer to our full time billable consultants and other professionals collectively as revenue generating professionals 
revenues generated by our full time billable consultants are primarily driven by the number of consultants we employ and their utilization rates  as well as the billing rates we charge our clients 
revenues generated by our other professionals are largely dependent on the number of variable consultants we employ  their hours worked and billing rates charged  as well as the number of pages reviewed and amount of data processed 

table of contents most of our revenues are generated under billing arrangements that are based on either the number of hours worked or units produced by our revenue generating professionals at agreed upon rates 
we refer to these types of arrangements as time and expense engagements 
time and expense engagements represented  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
in fixed fee engagements  we agree to a pre established fee in exchange for a pre determined set of consulting services 
we set the fees based on our estimates of the costs and timing for completing the fixed fee engagements 
it is the client s expectation in these engagements that the pre established fee will not be exceeded except in mutually agreed upon circumstances 
for the years ended december   and  fixed fee engagements represented approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
the increase primarily reflects the acquisition of wellspring  which has a larger percentage of fixed fee engagements 
performance based fee engagements generally tie fees to the attainment of contractually defined objectives 
we enter into performance based engagements in essentially two forms 
first  we generally earn fees that are directly related to the savings formally acknowledged by the client as a result of adopting our recommendations for improving cost effectiveness in the procurement area 
second  we have performance based engagements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain pre defined outcomes occur 
often this type of success fee supplements time and expense or fixed fee engagements 
while performance based fee revenues represented only  and of our revenues in  and  respectively  such revenues in the future may cause significant variations in quarterly revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance based criteria 
our quarterly results are impacted principally by our full time billable consultants utilization rate  the number of business days in each quarter and the number of our revenue generating professionals who are available to work 
our utilization rate can be negatively affected by increased hiring because there is generally a transition period for new professionals that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate 
our utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for our services from our clients 
for example  during the third and fourth quarters of the year  vacations taken by our clients can result in the deferral of activity on existing and new engagements  which would negatively affect our utilization rate 
the number of business work days is also affected by the number of vacation days taken by our consultants and holidays in each quarter 
we typically have to fewer business work days available in the third and fourth quarters of the year  which can impact revenues during those periods 
reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses that are billed to clients  primarily relating to travel and out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with engagements  are included in total revenues and reimbursable expenses  and typically an equivalent amount of these expenses are included in total direct costs and reimbursable expenses 
reimbursable expenses also include those subcontractors who are billed to our clients at cost 
the amount of reimbursable expenses included in total revenues and reimbursable expenses may not always correspond with the amount of these expenses included in total direct costs and reimbursable expenses due to the fact that revenues from reimbursable expenses associated with performance based engagements may be deferred and recognized at a later date when the revenue on these engagements is recognized 
this treatment can result in a timing difference between when revenue from reimbursable expenses is recognized and when such expenses are recognized in the statement of operations 
such timing differences are eliminated when the performance based engagement is completed  as total cumulative revenues from reimbursable expenses will equal the total cumulative reimbursable expenses incurred on the engagement 
we manage our business on the basis of revenues before reimbursable expenses 
we believe this is the most accurate reflection of our services because it eliminates the effect of these reimbursable expenses that we bill to our clients at cost 
total direct costs our most significant expenses are costs classified as total direct costs 
these total direct costs primarily include direct costs consisting of salaries  performance bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits for revenue generating 
table of contents professionals  as well as fees paid to independent subcontractors that we retain to supplement these professionals  typically on an as needed basis for specific client engagements 
direct costs also include share based compensation  which represents the cost of restricted stock and stock option awards granted to our revenue generating professionals 
compensation for share based awards is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally four years 
as a result of the granting of restricted common stock awards and anticipated future awards  share based compensation expense will increase in the future 
total direct costs also include intangible assets amortization relating to customer contracts 
operating expenses our operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  performance bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits  as well as share based compensation for our non revenue generating professionals 
compensation for share based awards is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally four years 
as a result of the granting of restricted common stock awards and anticipated future awards  share based compensation expense will increase in the future 
also included in this category are other sales and marketing related expenses  rent and other office related expenses  and professional fees 
other operating expenses include certain depreciation and amortization expenses not included in total direct costs 
segment results segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
these administrative function costs include corporate office support costs  certain office facility costs  costs relating to accounting and finance  human resources  legal  marketing  information technology and company wide business development functions  as well as costs related to overall corporate management 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make assessments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results 
while all decisions regarding accounting policies are important  we believe that there are five accounting policies that could be considered critical 
these critical policies relate to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services  carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and share based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the related services are provided  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
most of our services are rendered under arrangements that require the client to pay based on either the number of hours incurred or units produced by our revenue generating professionals at agreed upon rates and recognized as services are provided 
revenues related to fixed fee engagements are recognized based on estimates of work completed versus the total services to be provided under the 
table of contents engagement 
losses  if any  on fixed fee engagements are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues related to performance based engagements are recognized when all performance based criteria are met 
we also have contracts with clients to deliver multiple services that are covered under both individual and separate engagement letters 
these arrangements allow for our services to be valued and accounted for on a separate basis 
we recognize reimbursable expenses related to time and expense and fixed fee engagements as revenue in the period in which the expense is incurred 
we recognize reimbursable expenses subject to performance based criteria as revenue when all performance criteria are met 
we recognize direct costs incurred on all types of engagements  including performance based engagements  in the period in which incurred 
we record differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue as either unbilled services or deferred revenue 
revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed to clients are recorded as unbilled services 
amounts billed to clients but not yet recognized as revenues are recorded as deferred revenue 
client prepayments and retainers that are unearned are also classified as deferred revenue and recognized over future periods as earned in accordance with the applicable engagement agreement 
allowances for doubtful accounts and unbilled services we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and for services performed but not yet billed for estimated losses based on several factors  including the historical percentages of fee adjustments and write offs by practice group  an assessment of a client s ability to make required payments and the estimated cash realization from amounts due from clients 
the allowances are assessed by management on a regular basis 
if the financial condition of a client deteriorates in the future  impacting the client s ability to make payments  an increase to our allowances might be required or our allowances may not be sufficient to cover actual write offs 
we record the provision for doubtful accounts and unbilled services as a reduction in revenue to the extent the provision relates to fee adjustments and other discretionary pricing adjustments 
to the extent the provision relates to a client s inability to make required payments on accounts receivables  we record the provision in operating expenses 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our goodwill balance as of december  was million 
pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment arise  such as loss of key personnel  unanticipated competition  or other unforeseen developments 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge for the excess 
an impairment test involves considerable management judgment and estimates regarding future operating results and cash flows 
pursuant to our policy  we performed the annual goodwill assessment as of april  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
further  no indications of impairment have arisen since that date 
intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill 
our intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december  and consist of customer contracts  customer relationships  non competition agreements  a tradename  as well as technology and software 
we use valuation techniques in estimating the initial fair value of acquired intangible assets 
these valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the client contracts and relationships  discounted for assumptions about future customer attrition 
we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
therefore  higher or earlier than expected customer attrition may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for customer related intangible assets 
for example  during the third quarter of  we wrote off a portion of the intangible assets pertaining to a customer contract as described in client bankruptcy case below 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 
in preparing financial statements  we exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance 
in determining our provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we estimate our annual effective tax rate based on information available at each interim period 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we consider the historical and estimated future taxable income and other relevant factors of the operation recording the respective deferred tax asset 
if actual results differ from our estimates  or if these estimates are adjusted in future periods  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required 
to the extent that we increase the valuation allowance  our provision for income taxes will increase and our net income will decrease in the period that the adjustment is made 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets totaling million and have established a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties relating to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets recorded for foreign operating losses 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that companies recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value 
given the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our ipo  we established an estimated fair value of the common stock as well as the exercise price for the options to purchase this stock 
we estimated the fair value of our common stock by evaluating our results of business activities and projections of our future results of operations 

table of contents results of operations as previously described  historically we have provided our services through two operating segments financial consulting and operational consulting 
in response to our continued growth and acquisitions of complementary businesses  effective january   we reorganized our practice areas and service lines to better meet market demands and serve our clients 
under our current organizational structure  we manage our business under four operating segments financial consulting  legal consulting  health and education consulting  and corporate consulting

full time equivalents consist of our variable  on demand consultants  contract reviewers and our document review and processing groups 
the million increase in full time billable consultant revenues reflected growing demand for our services from

in addition  in january  we promoted ten of our revenue generating directors to the managing director level 
during  we expect to continue to hire additional managing directors and anticipate that some of them may not be in a position to generate revenues for a period of six months or more  as they will initially focus their time on new sales efforts 
additionally  a significant number of the managing directors who we will hire in may be subject to restrictive covenants and may require additional time to establish new client relationships 
in  we expect to hire additional managers  associates and analysts to expand support for our existing practices and better leverage our directors and managing directors

table of contents at december   we had a credit agreement with various financial institutions under which we may borrow up to million 
on february   we amended the credit agreement so that the maximum amount of principal that may be borrowed increased to million  with an accordion feature allowing for an additional amount of up to million to be borrowed upon approval from the lenders 
on july   we executed a fourth amendment to the credit agreement  increasing the maximum amount of principal that may be borrowed to million 
fees and interest on borrowings vary based on our total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio as set forth in the credit agreement and will be based on a spread over the london interbank offered rate libor or a spread over the base rate  which is the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate  as selected by us 
all outstanding principal is due upon expiration of the credit agreement on february  the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants that require us to maintain certain interest coverage ratio  total debt to ebitda ratio  and net worth levels

we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  and future needs our primary financing need has been to fund our growth 
our growth strategy is to expand our service offerings  which will require investments in new hires  acquisitions of complementary businesses  expansion into other geographic areas  and capital expenditures for information technology  office space  furniture and fixtures  as well as leasehold improvements 
in connection with our past business acquisitions  we may be required under earn out provisions to pay additional purchase consideration to the sellers if specific performance targets are met 
we also have other cash commitments as described below in contractual obligations 
we intend to fund the company s growth over the next twelve months with funds generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
because we expect that our future annual growth rate in revenues and related percentage increases in working capital balances will moderate  we believe our internally generated liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be adequate to fund our long term growth and capital needs arising from earn out provisions and cash commitments 
our ability to secure short term and long term financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  the quality of our accounts receivable and unbilled services  our relative levels of debt and equity and the overall condition of the credit markets

we lease office facilities under noncancelable operating leases that include fixed or minimum payments plus  in some cases  scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease 
certain leases provide for monthly payments of real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expense applicable to the property 
some of the leases contain provisions whereby the future rental payments may be adjusted for increases in operating expense above the specified amount 
in connection with certain business acquisitions  we may be required to pay additional purchase consideration to the sellers if specific performance targets and conditions are met over a number of years as specified in the related purchase agreements 
these amounts are generally calculated and payable at the end of each year 
there is no limitation to the maximum amount of additional purchase consideration and such amount is not determinable at this time  but the aggregate amount that potentially may be paid could be significant 
we would expect  however  to fund such payments using cash flows generated from our operations 
purchase obligations include information technology  marketing events  sponsorships  subscriptions to research tools and other commitments to purchase services where we cannot cancel or would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation 
as of december   our non current liability for uncertain tax positions totaled million 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this amount as it is dependent on examinations by taxing authorities
