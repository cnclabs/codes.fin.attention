item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our fiscal year typically includes weeks  comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter 
fiscal  fiscal and fiscal each consisted of weeks 
we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending 
we also have a leading international presence 
we operate through a network of company owned stores  all of which are in the united states  and  franchise stores located in all states and in more than countries 
in addition  we operate regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our company owned and franchise stores 
changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts 
we monitor both of these metrics very closely  as they directly impact our revenues and profits  and strive to consistently increase the related amounts 
retail sales drive company owned store revenues  royalty payments from franchisees and domestic supply chain revenues 
retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino s pizza brand  the success of our marketing promotions and our ability to execute our store operating model and other business strategies 
we devote significant attention to our brand building efforts  which is evident in our system s estimated billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age 
we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino s pizza brand 
we also pay particular attention to the store economics  or the investment performance of a store to its owner  of both our company owned and franchise stores 
we believe that our system s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino s pizza store 
we believe these favorable investment requirements  coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending  as well as high quality and focused menu offerings  drive strong store economics  which  in turn  drive demand for new stores 
in  global retail sales  which are total retail sales at company owned and franchise stores worldwide  increased as compared to this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts  offset in part by a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales 
in  global retail sales increased as compared to this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts 
revenues decreased million or in and increased million or in the decline in was due primarily to lower volumes in our domestic supply chain operations and lower food prices  primarily cheese and lower company owned store and international revenues 
the increase in revenues in was largely due to higher domestic supply chain revenues  due primarily to higher food prices  including cheese 
worldwide store counts have increased from  at the beginning of to  at the end of this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business 
domestic same store sales increased in and decreased and in and  respectively 
international same store sales increased  and during the same periods 
the company s domestic same store sales results in and reflected a weak consumer environment and the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years 
internationally  same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 

table of contents income from operations increased  from million in to million in and decreased in to million 
the growth in income from operations in was primarily the result of increases in global retail sales and related profits from domestic supply chain operations  as well as decreases in general and administrative expenses 
the decline in income from operations in was primarily the result of lower profits from the domestic stores and domestic supply chain operations  as well as certain recapitalization related expenses 
net income declined from million in to million in and declined from to million in the decline in net income in was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense in due primarily to higher average outstanding debt balances offset in part by lower average borrowing rates  both the result of the company s recapitalization and the aforementioned decrease in income from operations 
net income was also negatively impacted in by million of other expense related to the premium paid to repurchase and retire the senior subordinated notes that were tendered in the debt tender offer in connection with the recapitalization 
we are highly leveraged primarily as the result of recapitalizations in  and as of december   consolidated long term debt was billion 
since  a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases 
our securitized debt requires no principal payments until anticipated maturity in overall  we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible receivables  long lived and intangible assets  insurance and legal matters and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition 
we earn revenues through our network of domestic company owned and franchise stores  dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations 
retail sales from company owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers 
sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category 
additionally  we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while write offs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that future write offs will not exceed historical rates 
specifically  if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived and intangible assets 
we record long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and capitalized software  at cost 
for acquisitions of franchise operations  we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets  historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition 
we depreciate and amortize long lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us 
we review long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the related amounts might be impaired 
when required  we perform related impairment tests on a market level basis for company owned stores 
at december   we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
however  if our future operating performance were to deteriorate  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 

table of contents we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment 
at december   the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value  including the related goodwill 
however  if the future performance of our domestic company owned stores or domestic supply chain operations were to deteriorate  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
insurance and legal matters 
we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason  we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 
for certain periods prior to december and for periods after december  we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation  general liability and owned and non owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between  and million  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates  which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause these estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 
income taxes 
our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet  including tax reserves  also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance or other tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk prior to our recapitalization that was completed in april  we were exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
management actively monitored this exposure 
we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with the april recapitalization  we issued fixed rate notes and  at december   we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes 
as of december   we had million in variable funding note borrowings 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices 
during the normal course of business  we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and  as a result  we are subject to volatility in our food costs 
we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk 
we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in instances when we use forward pricing agreements with our suppliers  they always cover our physical commodity needs  are not net settled and are accounted for as normal purchases 
interest rate derivatives we have historically entered into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
on february   the company entered into a five year forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of billion to hedge the interest rate variability of the coupon payments associated with the issuance of billion of securitized debt in connection with the recapitalization 
on april   the swap agreement was settled in cash for million  in accordance with its terms  concurrent with the issuance of the securitized debt 
in connection with this settlement  the other comprehensive income amount was adjusted for the after tax net settlement amount of million which will be amortized into interest expense over the five year term of the securitized debt 
at december   the company does not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively  were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states
