overview of the advertising environment for lagged behind the rab has reported that trends in radio advertising revenue mirrored fluctuations in the current economic environment yielding mixed results over the last three years 
in  advertising revenues decreased  the first decline in growth in six years after increasing in and remaining flat in however  our performance in outpaced the industry with total pro forma net revenues decreasing by only see the explanation of our calculation of our pro forma results and a reconciliation of pro forma results to our historical results under results of operations 
our local and other revenue remained stable in as pro forma local net revenues declined slightly by 
while for  our pro forma net national revenues were down versus the prior year 
in may  we switched national sales representation firms to katz media group 
since the switch  we have seen improvements in our national revenue stream  attributable to the systems and resources employed by katz 
we believe that as our relationship with katz continues  we will be able to achieve greater improvement in our national revenue stream 
our management team remains focused on our strategy of pursuing growth through acquisition 
however  acquisitions are closely evaluated to ensure that they will generate stockholder value and our management is committed to completing only those acquisitions that we believe will increase our share price 
the compression of publicly traded radio broadcast company multiples since  combined with a market for privately held radio stations that did not see a corresponding multiples compression  translated to minimal acquisition activity for us in given the lack of suitable acquisition opportunities in and  our board authorized us to purchase an aggregate of million in shares of our class a common stock  within the limits set forth under our then existing credit agreement and over a time frame that would mitigate any factors that would otherwise increase our leverage levels 
in addition  in we completed a board approved recapitalization that included a modified dutch auction tender offer for million shares of our outstanding class a common stock and a related purchase of million shares of our outstanding class b common stock 
in june  the company entered into an amendment to its existing credit agreement  dated june   by and among the company  bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto 
the credit agreement  as amended  is referred to herein as the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for a replacement term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million  which replaces the prior term loan facility that had an outstanding balance of approximately million at the time of refinancing  and maintains the pre existing million revolving credit facility 

table of contents as of december   the effective interest rate on the borrowings pursuant to the new credit facility was approximately 
as of december   our average cost of debt  including the effects of our derivative positions  was 
we remain committed to maintaining manageable debt levels  which will continue to improve our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
our business we engage in the acquisition  operation  and development of commercial radio stations in mid size radio markets in the united states 
in addition  we  along with three private equity firms  formed cumulus media partners  llc cmp  which acquired the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna pfaltzgraff co 
susquehanna in may the acquisition included radio stations in markets 
as a result of our investment in cmp and the acquisition of susquehanna s radio operations  we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on number of stations and believe we are the third largest radio broadcasting company based on net revenues 
as of december   directly and through our investment in cmp  we owned or operated stations in us markets and provided sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to one additional station 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million in  million in  and in our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
local advertising represented approximately of our total revenues in and  and in our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income 
see the quantitative reconciliation of station operating income to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  that follows in this section

pro forma station operating income increased from the same period in seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources on july   we entered into a merger agreement with parent and merger sub 
under the terms of the merger agreement  merger sub will be merged with and into the company  with the company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of parent 
it is anticipated that the funds necessary to consummate the merger and related transactions will be funded by new or existing credit facilities and equity financing arranged by parent 
our capitalization  liquidity and capital resources will change substantially if the merger is approved by our stockholders and is consummated 
upon the closing of the merger  we will be highly leveraged 
our liquidity requirements will be significant  primarily due to debt service requirements and financing costs relating to the indebtedness expected to be incurred in connection with the closing of the refinancing transactions 
we have also agreed that  until the completion of the merger  except as expressly contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement  required by applicable law or consented to in writing by parent which consent may not be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed  we will not  and will not permit any of our subsidiaries to except in the ordinary course of business with respect to departing employees or in connection with cashless exercises pursuant to our stock incentive plans  declare or pay any dividend  or make any other distribution on  or directly or indirectly redeem  purchase or otherwise acquire or encumber  any shares of our capital

historically  our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets capital expenditures repurchases of common stock repayments of bank borrowings interest payments in the short term  our principal future need for funds will include the funding of station operating expenses  corporate general and administrative expenses and interest and debt service payments 
in addition  in the long term  our funding needs will include future acquisitions and capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations and implementing hd radio tm technology 
in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology on up to of our stations 
under the terms of the agreement with ibiquity  we will convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between  and  our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from borrowings under credit facilities 
we believe that our presently projected cash flow from operations and present financing arrangements  including availability under our existing credit facilities  or borrowings that would be available from future financing arrangements  will be sufficient to 
table of contents meet our future capital needs  and operations and debt service for the next twelve months 
however  our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics or audience tastes  and borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
as such  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
see item ia risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million or for the year ended december  excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels of operating income for as compared with the prior years 
as a result  the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased million  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the absence  in the current year period of acquisitions and the purchases of intangible assets  million of proceeds from the sale of assets and a million reduction of capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  for fiscal  we invested approximately million in station acquisitions and the purchase of certain broadcast licenses in its houston  texas market 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities decreased million  due to a decrease in costs associated with share repurchases offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the refinancing as compared to the refinancing 
during  net cash used in financing activities increased million 
primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  offset by an increase in borrowings under a new credit facility primarily used to fund these repurchases 
during net cash used in financing related primarily to million paid to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock  offset by net borrowings under our credit facilities of utilized to fund acquisitions and the share repurchases 
historical acquisitions and dispositions 
completed acquisitions we did not complete any acquisitions during pending acquisitions 
as of december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which it would exchange one of its fort walton beach  florida radio stations  wyzb fm  for another owned by star broadcasting  inc  wtke fm 
specifically  the purchase agreement provided for the exchange of wyzb fm plus million in cash for wtke fm 
following the filing of the assignment applications with the fcc the applications were challenged by qantum communications  who has some radio stations in the market and complained to the fcc that the swap would give us an unfair competitive advantage because the station we would acquire reaches more people than the station we would be giving up 
qantum also initiated litigation in the united states district court for the southern district of florida against the current owner of wtke fm  and secured a court decision that would 
table of contents require the sale of the station to qantum instead of us 
although that decision is still subject to appeal  there is a possibility that we will be unable to consummate the exchange it had proposed with the seller 
as of december   we had pending a swap transaction pursuant to which it would exchange its canton  oh station  wrqk fm  for eight stations owned by clear channel in ann arbor  michigan wtka am  wlby am  wwww fm  wqkl fm and battle creek  michigan wbfn am  wbck fm  wbck am and wbxx fm 
two of the am stations in battle creek  wbck am and wbfn am  will be disposed of by the company simultaneously with the closing of the swap transaction to comply with the fcc s broadcast ownership limits  wbck am will be placed in a trust for the sale of the station to an unrelated third party and wbfn am will be transferred to family life broadcasting system 
completed dispositions on november   we completed the sale of our caribbean stations to gem radio limited which purchased all the operations of our caribbean stations for million

each of the foregoing amendments and agreements shall be effective should we issue a written notice to the administrative agent specifying such effectiveness  which we may only so specify on the date of the consummation or substantial consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 
in connection with the retirement of our pre existing credit facilities  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million for  which was comprised of previously capitalized loan origination expenses 
in connection with the new credit facility  we capitalized approximately million of debt issuance costs  which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets 
table of contents and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although our management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that the carrying value of our goodwill and certain intangible assets be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
for  we reviewed the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill and determined that their fair value exceeded their carrying amount and  as such  did not record an impairment charge 
during   and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately   and million  respectively in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we have million in intangible assets and goodwill  which represent approximately of our total assets 
the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units  for purposes of our annual impairment tests  was derived primarily by using a discounted cash flows approach 
the fair market values derived include assumptions that contain a variety of variables 
these variables are based on industry data  historical experience and estimates of future performance and include  but are not limited to  revenue and expense growth rates for each radio market  revenue and expense growth rates for our stations in each market  overall discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital and acquisition multiples 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair market value of goodwill are based on currently available data and our management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a significant effect on the estimated value 
a future decrease in the fair market value of broadcast licenses or goodwill in a market could result in additional impairment charges 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
we have established a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases digital radio capital obligations other operating contracts total contractual cash obligations under our credit agreement  the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants 
based on long term debt amounts outstanding at december   scheduled annual principal amortization and the current effective interest rate on such long term debt amounts outstanding  we would be obligated to pay approximately million of interest on borrowings through june million due in less than one year  million due in years two and three  million due in years four and five and million due after five years 
amount represents the estimated capital requirements to convert of our stations to a digital broadcasting format in future periods 
consists of contractual obligations for goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding obligations that include all significant terms 
in addition  amounts include million of station acquisition purchase price that was deferred beyond the closing of the transaction and that is being paid monthly over a year period and also includes employment contract with ceo  mr

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  accounting pronouncements see note in the accompanying notes to the audited financial statements 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  
table of contents it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in may  we entered into a forward starting effective march libor based interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  that are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the sale of our two foreign subsidiaries  consummated on november   we no longer measure any of our operations in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are no longer subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets where we had operations
