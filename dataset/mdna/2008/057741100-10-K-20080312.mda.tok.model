table of contents on january   baldor completed the acquisition of reliance 
reliance is a leading manufacturer of industrial electric motors  and other power transmission products 
the acquisition extends baldor s product offerings  provides a manufacturing base in china for the asian markets  increases the company s manufacturing capabilities and flexibility  strengthens the management team  and provides strong opportunities for synergies and cost savings 
the purchase price was billion  consisting of billion in cash and million shares of baldor common stock valued at million  based on the average closing price per share of baldor s common stock on the new york stock exchange for the three days preceding and the three days subsequent to november   the date of the definitive purchase agreement

net proceeds from the over allotment offering of approximately million were utilized to reduce borrowings under the senior secured credit facility 
reliance s results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning february  generally  our financial performance is driven by industrial spending and the strength of the economies in which we sell our products  and is also influenced by investments in manufacturing capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  our customers needs for greater variety  timely delivery  and higher quality at a competitive cost  and our large installed base  which creates a significant replacement demand 
we are not dependent on any one industry or customer for our financial performance  and no single customer represented more than of our net sales for the years ended december   december   and december  for the years ended december   december   and december   domestic net sales generated through distributors  representing primarily sales of replacement products  amounted to   and  respectively 
domestic sales to oems were approximately   and  respectively  for the same periods 
oems primarily use our products in new installations 
we manufacture substantially all of our products 
consequently  our costs include the cost of raw materials  including steel  copper and aluminum  and energy costs 
each of these costs has increased in the past few years due to growing global demand for these commodities  impacting our cost of sales 
we seek to offset these increases through a continued focus on product design improvements  including redesigning our products to reduce material content and investing in capital equipment that assists in eliminating waste  and by modest price increases in our products 
our manufacturing facilities are also significant sources of fixed costs 
our margin is impacted when we cannot promptly decrease these costs to match declines in net sales 
industry trends the demand for products in the industrial electric motor  generator  and power transmission industries is closely tied to growth trends in the economy and levels of industrial activity and capital investment 
we believe that specific drivers of demand for our products include process automation  efforts in energy conservation and productivity improvement  regulatory and safety 
table of contents requirements  new technologies and replacement of worn parts 
our products are typically critical parts of customers end applications  and the end user s cost associated with their failure is high 
consequently  we believe that end users of our products base their purchasing decisions on quality  reliability and availability as well as customer service  rather than the price alone 
we believe key success factors in our industry include strong reputation and brand preference  good customer service and technical support  product availability  and a strong distribution network

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facility 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility 
we expect that ongoing requirements for operations  capital expenditures  dividends  and debt service will be adequately funded from these sources 
we have senior secured debt ratings of ba with a stable outlook by moody s investors services  inc moody s and bb with a stable outlook by standard poor s rating service s p 
we have a senior unsecured debt rating of b with a stable outlook by moody s 
we have no downward rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts drawn under our senior secured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes 
our senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured credit facility contain various customary covenants  which limit  among other things  indebtedness and dispositions of assets  and which require us to maintain compliance with certain quarterly financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents the table below summarizes baldor s contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by years total less than more than contractual obligations long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations other commercial commitments letters of credit a includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates 
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we expect to make benefit payments of approximately million in related our postretirement health plan 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented 
dividend policy dividends paid to shareholders amounted to per common share in  per common share in  and per common share in the objective is for shareholders to receive dividends while also participating in baldor s growth 
terms of our credit agreement and indenture related to financing the acquisition of reliance limit our ability to increase dividends in the future 
market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates  concentrations of credit  and foreign exchange rates 
to help maintain stable pricing for customers  we enter into various commodity hedging transactions 
to manage interest rate risk on variable rate outstanding debt  we enter into various interest rate hedging transactions 
we are a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  copper  and aluminum  and periodically utilize commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effects of changing commodity prices 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
management has determined that a hypothetical change in the fair value of open positions would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
our interest rate risk is primarily related to long term debt 
as a result of the acquisition of reliance  we have a senior secured credit facility which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  our long term obligations include senior unsecured notes totalling million which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
we utilize various interest rate hedge instruments to manage our future exposure to interest rate risk on a portion of the variable rate obligations 
critical terms notional amount  interest reset dates  and underlying index of the hedge instruments coincide with those of the credit facility 
consequently  the hedges are expected to offset changes in the expected cash flows due to fluctuations in the interest rate over the term of the hedge instrument 
details regarding the instruments as of december   are as follows 
table of contents instrument notional amount maturity rate paid rate received fair value swap million april  libor million collar million april  libor libor  floor  cap million libor is determined each reset date based on london and new york business days 
floating rates used in instruments are matched exactly to floating rate in credit agreement 
fair value is an estimated amount that the company would have received paid at december   to terminate the agreement 
based on the outstanding balance of the senior secured credit facility  interest rate elections under the credit agreement and interest rate hedges at december   a movement in interest rates would not have a significant impact on annual interest expense 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas and industries 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral 
no single customer represents more than of net accounts receivable for any period presented in this report 
foreign affiliates comprise approximately of our consolidated net sales 
as a result  our exposure to foreign currency risk is not significant 
we continue to monitor the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and will utilize foreign currency hedges where appropriate 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies  which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis  current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions  and historical experience 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  except for non us inventories  which are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the net realizable value of inventory is reviewed on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory values may be required 
self insurance liabilities baldor s self insurance programs primarily include product liability  workers compensation  and health 
we self insure from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels 
eligible losses in excess of self insurance retention levels and up to stated limits of liability are covered by policies purchased from third party insurers 
the aggregate self insurance liability is estimated using claims experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued and current conditions 
adjustments to the self insurance liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment and more frequently if indicators of impairment warrant additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in order to test for impairment  goodwill acquired is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination 
the company determines reporting units pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
management utilizes a discounted cash flows analysis to determine the estimated fair value of reporting units 
judgments and assumptions related to revenue  gross profit  operating expenses  interest  capital expenditures  cash flows  and market conditions are inherent in these estimates 
the results of the discounted cash flows analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
management utilizes a relief from royalty methodology to estimate the fair value of indefinite lived intangibles 
if the carrying value of indefinite lived intangibles exceeds the estimate fair value of those intangibles  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
at december   goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles amounted to  million and million  respectively 
the and annual impairment tests resulted in no indication of impairment 
use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from these estimates which could ultimately result in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements 
share based compensation share based compensation expense is recognized using the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
r  share based payments 
the fair value of the options is estimated using a black scholes option pricing formula 
the variables used in the option pricing formula for each grant are determined at the time of grant as follows volatility is based on the daily composite closing price of baldor s stock over a look back period of time that approximates the expected option life  risk free interest rates are based on the yield of us treasury strips as published in the wall street journal or provided by a third party on the date of the grant for the expected option life  dividend yields are based on baldor s dividend yield published in the wall street journal or provided by a third party on the date of the grant  and expected option life represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical experience 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development and backlog are expensed at the date of acquisition 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
the valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management 

table of contents there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we typically use relief from royalty and income methods 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the assessment of the asset s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal  regulatory  or economic barriers to entry 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fas  fair value measurements 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
the company is required to adopt fas for fiscal year and management does not expect fas to have a significant impact on the financial results 
in february  the fasb issued fas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

fas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  and expands the use of fair value measurement in order to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
fas is effective beginning with the company s fiscal year and management has determined that fas will have no impact on the financial results 
in december  the fasb issued fas revised  business combinations fas r  effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  fas r establishes principles and requirements on how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase and accounting for transaction costs 
additionally  fas r determines what information must be disclosed to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the company will adopt fas r upon its effective date as appropriate for any future business combinations
