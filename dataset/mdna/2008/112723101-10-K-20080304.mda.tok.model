item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read along with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and item a risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
outlook was one of the most challenging years for the housing industry on record 
the supply of resale and new homes far exceeds demand and even though new home production in the united states has dropped to million units per year  we do not anticipate that an equilibrium between the supply and demand for housing will be reached before this continuing imbalance  as well as the disruption in credit markets  has led to continued weak consumer confidence  a critical factor for home sales 
the challenging market conditions in negatively impacted our operations with lower home sales per community  price reductions  high home sale cancellation rates and consequently higher inventories than planned 
these factors resulted in a decrease in home closings to units  below our targeted home closings for of  to  units 
the lower volumes and sales price declines resulted in a significant decrease in net income and for the first year in our history we did not have positive operating cash flow 
overview we entitle and develop land for our own communities and sell lots to third parties 
we also design  construct and market single and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers 
we operate in the following geographic regions which are presented as our reportable segments northern california san francisco bay area and sacramento  southland los angeles  san diego riverside and the washington dc area 
our other operations that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate segment disclosure are included in corporate and other 
our goal is to maximize the total return on our common stockholders equity over the long term 
we plan to achieve this by actively managing our assets and creating value on the lots we own or control 
since going public in  we have limited the capital placed at risk  and have returned  through dividends and share buybacks  million to shareholders  or in excess of per share 
at current share prices  the compounded return on stockholders equity for the period to has exceeded 
for the period to  cash provided from operations was million  which was used primarily to return cash to stockholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends 
despite the continuing challenges of the united states housing market  we believe our business is positioned to create further shareholder value over the long term through the selective control of a number of strategic projects and the overall level of lots controlled 
the  lots that we control   of which we own directly or through joint ventures  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow 
we believe we add value to the lots we control through entitlements  development and the construction of homes 
in allocating capital to our operations  we generally limit our risk on unentitled land by optioning such land positions in all our markets thereby mitigating our capital at risk 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control lots for an extended period of time 
homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented approximately of our total revenue since our operations are currently positioned to close up to  homes annually 
operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price 
we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders  generally on an opportunistic basis where we can redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns or reduce risk in a market 
in  we sold  lots  the majority of which were bulk sales of raw or undeveloped land in our southland and san diego operations 
the number of lots we sell may vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and nature of such sales which are also affected by local market conditions 
our housing and land inventory  investments in housing and land joint ventures  and consolidated land inventory not owned together comprised of our total assets as of december  in addition  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in other assets 
other assets consist of homebuyer receivables of million  deferred income taxes and income taxes receivable of million  and mortgages and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 
carrying values the housing and land inventory that we own directly and through joint ventures is reviewed for recoverability on a regular basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at this amount  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project  and our estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  they are then written down to the fair value less estimated selling costs 
the ultimate fair values for our housing and land inventory are dependent upon future market and economic conditions 
if our estimate of future cash flows is significantly different from our actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
in these cases  our housing and land inventory would be represented on our balance sheet at other than its cost or fair value  which could have an effect on our gross margin in future periods as we develop and sell the assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of impairment charges related to housing and land we directly own which is included in our direct cost of sales 
the million in impairment charges were related to  lots located in the inland empire of california and washington dc area 
in addition  we wrote off million  primarily related to unentitled lot option agreements on  lots that expired or which we are no longer pursuing and we recognized million in impairment charges and write downs on investments related to lots in our joint ventures 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
direct costs are capitalized to individual homes and lots and other costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and lots sold are recorded at the time of closing 
these estimates are prepared on an individual home and lot basis and take into account the specific cost components of each individual home and lot 
the estimation process to allocate costs to homes and lots is dependent on project budgets that are based on various assumptions  including construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
these estimates are reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing and adjustments are made if necessary 
if the estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of homes are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  wherein all proceeds are received or collectability is evident 
land sales are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  all material conditions of the sales contract have been met and a significant cash down payment or appropriate security is received  and collectability is evident

cash flow our principal uses of working capital include purchases of land  land development and home construction 
cash flows for each of our communities depend upon the applicable stage of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  site approvals and entitlements  construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities and other amenities and general landscaping 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during such early stages may significantly exceed cash flows 
later  cash flows can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales include charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs

d amounts do not include interest due to the floating nature of our debt 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we use lot option contracts and joint ventures to acquire control of land to mitigate the risk of declining land values 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control the land for an extended period of time  until options expire and or we are ready to develop the land to construct homes or sell the land 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the united states financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas allows companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value 
companies electing the fair value option are required to report subsequent changes in fair value in earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year beginning january  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently reviewing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our fiscal year beginning january   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently reviewing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year
