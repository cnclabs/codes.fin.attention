business and industry overview ciber provides information technology it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  as well as eastern asia  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our five operating segments  commercial solutions  european operations  state local government solutions  federal government solutions and us erp solutions formerly us package solutions are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
our commercial  state local and federal segments comprise our us geographically based operations that provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
these offices report to a segment based on their primary client focus category commercial  state local or federal  however  they also may have clients that fall into another category 
for example  a commercial office may also provide services to a government client 
our india based operations are considered part of our commercial segment 
our us erp segment primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as oracle  sap and lawson 
our european segment represents our offices in europe  eastern asia  australia and new zealand that provide a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services 
we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our commercial  federal and state local segments typically around to as compared to our us erp and european segments typically around to 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it results in higher costs and lowers gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour and  on average  are generally highest in our us erp segment and lowest in our federal segment 
we also have fixed priced projects  as well as engagements whose pricing is based on cost plus or level of efforts 
for such projects  where our revenue is not directly based on hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects 
in addition  our foreign revenue is impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
our us erp segment typically has higher sg a costs than our other domestic segments due to the longer sales cycle associated with erp projects 
erp projects generally also have higher billing rates and higher gross margins 
our european segment typically has the highest sg a costs as a percentage of revenue of all of our segments because it carries overhead personnel and related expenses for general and administrative tasks  such as accounting and human resources  etc 
in each of its territories  as well as its high proportion of erp project work 
in the us  our general and administrative tasks are centralized corporate functions and are generally not charged to our domestic segments 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross profit percentage on other revenues is approximately 
this is a blend of low margin product sales typically to and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit percentage on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
business combinations in  we acquired california based metamor enterprise solutions llc metamor  which had approximately consultants at the time of the acquisition 
metamor provided sap software implementation services and was a reseller of sap products 
the metamor acquisition provided scale to our domestic sap activities 
also in  we acquired a small swedish sap consulting business 
in  we acquired two small sap consulting businesses in europe 
the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing date of the respective acquisition 
impacts of share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r and began recording compensation expense for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights in our financial statements 
such compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the options or rights on the date of grant 
on january   substantially all of our outstanding stock options were fully vested due to vesting accelerations that occurred prior to january   and as such  they have little impact on our share based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r during or in subsequent years 
share based compensation cost is included as part of our corporate expenses and is recognized in either cost of consulting services or in sg a expenses  as appropriate 
the table below summarizes the amounts recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for share based compensation year ended december  in thousands cost of consulting services selling  general and administrative expense total share based compensation cost before taxes income tax benefit related to share based compensation total share based compensation included in net income comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income average hourly billing rate consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december   increased compared to total revenue for the year ended december  we are a global company  therefore  our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
throughout  the us dollar weakened against many currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues 
for the year ended december   the weak us dollar resulted in an additional million of reported revenue over the year ended december  additionally  a fourth quarter acquisition completed in europe and the domestic sap acquisition completed in september  plus two second quarter european acquisitions contributed incremental revenue of approximately million to the current year results 
excluding the favorable currency translation effects and the incremental revenue from acquisitions  our total revenue for the year ended december   increased from total revenue reported for the year ended december   primarily due to increased sap software related services in europe 
revenue by segment was as follows year ended december  change in thousands commercial solutions european operations state local government solutions federal government solutions us erp solutions inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful commercial segment revenue increased during the comparable years due to a couple of new  large clients and engagement wins led by growth in our boston  washington dc and seattle offices 
this segment can be characterized in as providing stable contributions  but lacking significant growth 
moving ahead  we are working to position this segment to be more successful in gaining market share 
million of the million increase in our european segment revenue was due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  europe had another million of incremental revenue from small acquisitions 
excluding these items  our european segment grew resulting from strong sales of sap implementation services in all of our major operating territories  and extending to australia and new zealand 
in the current year  europe represents approximately of our consolidated revenue  compared to of consolidated revenue in for the first time in our history  during the last quarter of  europe was our largest segment for that period 
it would be difficult for this segment to continue such a high level of growth in  especially if the us dollar strengthens against the euro and british pound 
state local segment revenue growth for was driven by incremental revenue from the pennsylvania turnpike commission project that began in mid however  these gains were tempered by a decreasing level of services provided to the city of new orleans during  which resulted in current year revenues that were almost half of revenues earned from the city of new orleans 
for  we have realigned this segment on a regional basis and plan to emphasize repeatable solutions to stimulate additional growth opportunities 
the continued revenue decrease in our federal segment is due to a very difficult governmental spending environment  illustrated by funding delays for information technology initiatives 
over the past two years  we have had a couple of our larger  long term federal contracts expire that we have not been able to replace with similar duration contracts 
in  this segment focused on qualifying for prime contractor bidding status and will continue this focus into when achieved  prime contractor bidding status will increase our growth opportunities 
over half of the growth in total revenue in our us erp segment  or million during the year ended december   was related to an acquisition completed in september excluding that acquisition  our us erp segment grew over in  compared to software related services  primarily for sap products  are up approximately this year  however  this was partially offset by reduced product commission revenue 
our sales of ibm products have slowed as customers have delayed their orders for some ibm product lines that are in the process of turning over 
we expect our product commission revenues to improve once the new products are released 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin improved basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in gross profit margin on consulting services revenue  which grew by basis points  accounted for the increase 
the increase in gross profit margin reflects a strong consulting services margin improvement in our us erp  europe and commercial segments  which increased by basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
additionally  europe s consulting services projects typically have higher gross profit margins compared to similar domestic projects 
with europe delivering a higher percentage of our consolidated revenues  our gross profit margins increase more than if the same revenue was generated domestically 
offsetting the above consulting services margin increases were decreases in consulting services margins of basis points and basis points in our state local and federal segments  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margin on other revenue to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   was due to reduced margins on software sales primarily in our europe segment  as well as a decrease in high margin product commission revenue in our us erp segment 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses improved slightly to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  our european and state local segments led the improvement for the current year with basis point and basis point improvements  respectively  and was aided by more modest decreases in the us erp and commercial segments 
although europe showed a sizable percentage decrease in sg a expenses  its higher gross margin business carries inherently higher sg a costs 
with europe representing a greater percentage of our overall revenue  sg a expense as a percentage of revenue on a total company basis is driven upward 
overall  our domestic sg a expense was held to less than a increase year over year  but sg a increased by million in our european segment from last year  representing a increase 
about half of the increase in europe s sg a is from foreign currency exchange rate changes  while the other half is from growth to support our expanding operations 
operating income 
as a result of the improved total gross profit margin and the slightly reduced sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  our operating income improved basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  operating income by segment was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands commercial solutions european operations state local government solutions federal government solutions us erp solutions corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income segments calculated as a of segment revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue commercial segment operating income percentage for the current year increased as a large  low margin fixed priced project ended in late and our newer engagements have been yielding slightly better margins 
european segment operating income improved primarily due to a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue that was attained from operating leverage achieved on higher revenue volumes 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by a basis point decrease in gross margin in although consulting services margins improved by basis points in as europe continued to shift toward more higher margin services  this was more than offset by decreased margins on other revenue 
margins decreased on other revenue due to lower sales of proprietary software products  as well as pricing pressures on our resale of third party software products 
state local operating income improved slightly in compared to primarily related to million in reduced sg a expenses  which more than offset the decrease in gross profit margin on consulting services in this segment 
federal segment operating income for was hurt by lower utilization and some low margin fixed price projects  as well as increased sg a expenses for sales and operations infrastructure enhancements 
us erp segment operating income improved considerably given the completion of several low gross profit projects earlier in the current year  as well as improved project delivery 
our improvement in consulting services margins was partially offset by decreased contributions from product commissions in additionally  their reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue also contributed to the improved operating income margin 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million in  compared to other income  net of  in other expense in consisted mainly of minority interest expense of million and net foreign currency transaction losses of million  offset by a gain on the retirement of our convertible senior subordinated debentures of  and additional proceeds from the sale of our ibm staffing operation of  other income in consisted mainly of net foreign currency transaction gains of  and additional proceeds from the sale of our ibm staffing operation of  offset by minority interest expense of  income taxes 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate was favorably impacted by recording a multi year benefit from amending certain prior years tax returns because of additional allowable deductions identified  as well as a us federal research and experimentation tax credit 
our effective tax rate in reflected an increase in our us federal research and experimentation tax credit 
the us federal research and experimentation tax credit expired on december   and unless it is extended  it will negatively impact our tax rate in future years 
accordingly  we expect our effective tax rate will be higher in comparison of the year ended december  and consolidated the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income average hourly billing rate consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december   increased million or over compared to total revenue for the year ended december  this increase was despite an million decrease in total revenue in related to the august sale of our ibm staffing operation 
offsetting the sale were some small acquisitions that contributed incremental revenue of million to our results 
excluding from the impact of the sale and acquisitions mentioned above  as well as million of additional revenue resulting from favorable currency translation effects  our total revenue for the year ended december   increased over total revenue reported for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to growth of each in our europe  state local and us erp segments 
revenue by segment was as follows year ended december  change in thousands commercial solutions european operations state local government solutions federal government solutions us erp solutions inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful our commercial segment results were relatively flat between the comparable years  however  absent the impact of the sale of our ibm staffing operation in mid  the growth rate for this segment was actually for this growth rate was achieved mainly because of a healthy demand environment 
european revenues for were up  including the positive impact from the two small acquisitions during  which contributed approximately million in incremental revenue  as well as an additional million in revenue from positive exchange rate fluctuations 
the remaining growth of was primarily related to strong revenue growth in our netherlands  norway and sweden based operations 
additionally  our european segment revenue was constrained by approximately million due to two fixed price projects in our denmark operation 
these two fixed price projects also constrained european segment revenues during  although to a much lesser extent 
state local revenue increased over in  compared to incremental revenue from the city of new orleans that began in june and the pennsylvania turnpike commission project that began in mid  accounted for much of the revenue increase 
the decrease in federal segment revenue is due primarily to the loss of revenue from a large outsourcing contract where ciber was a subcontractor to a larger prime vendor 
the term of the outsourcing contract ended and it was required by the federal agency for which the work was being performed that the contract be re bid 
ciber and the prime vendor with whom we partnered were unsuccessful in our effort to continue providing services under the contract 
loss of this contract resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately million in the second half of and approximately million during growth in total revenue in our us erp segment for represented organic growth resulting from a very robust demand environment and an increased emphasis on our relationship with sap 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to of revenue in from of revenue in  primarily due to lower consulting services margins in our federal and us erp segments  which decreased by basis points and basis points  respectively  between the comparative years 
the decreased services margin in our federal segment was due to higher margin revenue recognized in on an outsourcing contract that was lost in the middle of the us erp segment struggled with higher labor costs  continued reliance on higher priced subcontractors  plus unexpected cost overruns associated with projects that were completed during  all of which significantly affected its gross services margins in these decreases were primarily offset by a basis point improvement in consulting services gross profit margin in our commercial segment that was the result of a continued shift toward higher margin solution business 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses increased basis points to in from in the sg a percentage increase is largely a function of business mix 
our european segment  which has expected higher sg a costs and higher gross profit  accounted for a higher percentage of revenue in compared to  and accounted for almost half of the increase in sg a dollars spent during the year 
excluding europe  sg a costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly as we continued to invest in our offshore operation and our national practices and as we began expensing stock options on january  operating income 
as a result of the decrease in gross profit margin and the slightly increased sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  our operating income decreased basis points to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  operating income by segment was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands commercial solutions european operations state local government solutions federal government solutions us erp solutions corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income segments calculated as a of segment revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue the commercial segment s increase in gross profit margin was more than offset by higher sg a costs  resulting in a basis point decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue in compared to costs associated with the investment in our offshore operations and our national practices are all captured in this segment and account for the majority of the increase in sg a expenses 
the improvement in europe s operating income resulted almost entirely from a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue that was attained from operating leverage achieved on higher revenue volumes 
the state local segment s operating income percentage was significantly impacted by an improvement in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue  which was the result of cost cutting efforts within the segment 
the decrease in the federal segment s operating income percentage reflects the basis point decrease in the gross profit margin discussed above  coupled with an increase in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
although sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased  sg a dollars decreased for compared to sg a expense did not decrease at the same rate that revenue declined as sales and deal pursuit efforts intensified in an attempt to replace the lost outsourcing revenue 
us erp segment operating income decreased considerably due to the sizable decrease in gross profit margin on consulting services  mentioned above  which was only partially offset by a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was  in  compared to other expense  net of  in other income in consisted mainly of net foreign currency transaction gains of  and additional proceeds from the sale of our ibm staffing operation of  offset by minority interest expense of  other expense in was primarily comprised of a million gain on the sale of our ibm staffing operation  offset by net foreign currency transaction losses of  and minority interest expense of  income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in  compared to in our effective tax rates in both and were favorably impacted by a federal research credit 
additionally  the tax rate reflects the multi year benefit from amending certain prior years tax returns because of additional allowable deductions identified 
the lower rate in was due to an adjustment to the expected benefit of the research credit related to prior years activities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  historically  we have used our operating cash flow and borrowings  as well as periodic sales of our common stock to finance ongoing operations and business combinations

many of the individual reasons are outside of our control  and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding accounts receivable from the city of new orleans the city 
although we continue to provide services to the city  approximately million of this receivable is related to the hurricane disaster 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we have been informed that fema has so far approved approximately million of our invoices for reimbursement to the city and they began making reimbursements to the city in january we continue to work with the city and fema on the balance 
based on our communications with the city and fema  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
through february   we have received payments totaling over million from the city 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   due to increased payroll levels in europe 
these balances are subject to the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at both december  and  there were days of unpaid wages 
in addition  annual bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year and paid in the first quarter of the following year  causing some fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
due to the slower ibm product sales during the second half of  our accounts payable balance related to hardware is down million at december   compared to investing activities

convertible senior subordinated debentures in a private placement on december   we issued million of debentures due to mature in december during  for a total purchase price of million and a resulting gain of approximately  we were able to retire million of our debentures  leaving an outstanding balance of million at december  the debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the debentures  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions

beginning december   we may  by providing at least days notice to the holders  redeem any of the debentures at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
given our current stock price and market interest rates  we expect that we will be required to repurchase most or all of the remaining million of debentures on december  as such  from january   through march   we repurchased and retired million of our debentures  leaving million outstanding 
we may voluntarily continue to repurchase some of the debentures prior to december  we believe our new revolving credit facility mentioned above and our expected cash flow will provide sufficient available resources to cover the payment of any debentures that we will have to settle in contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our debentures of million are not due until  however  we expect to be required to repurchase most or all of the million on december   and we may voluntarily repurchase them prior to that date see additional discussion in the liquidity section of this annual report on form k 
since we cannot predict the timing of the repurchases of the debentures  for purposes of this table  we have assumed that they will remain outstanding throughout and then will be repurchased utilizing borrowings available to us under our new revolving credit facility 
as such  we have reflected the outstanding balance of debentures as being required to be repaid in full by february   which is the expiration date of the revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 
long term debt also includes the balance on our bank line of credit  which was replaced subsequent to year end with our new revolving credit facility 
as such  the balance of the bank line of credit will be subject to the terms of the revolving credit facility  and we have reflected payments in future periods in accordance with those terms 
interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and incorporating the assumptions mentioned in the above footnotes to this table regarding the repurchase of our debentures and the replacement of our debentures and our bank line of credit with our new revolving credit facility 
additionally  the calculations of interest payments were based on effective interest rates as of december   for our fixed and variable rate borrowings 
includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as of january  at december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million  all of which is expected to be paid after one year 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when a cash settlement with the appropriate taxing authority may occur  as such  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value  sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements and requires new disclosures about fair value measurements for future transactions 
in february  the fasb issued staff positions no 
and no 
 which partially defer the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities

 entities may irrevocably elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement of certain financial instruments and certain other items 
subsequent measurements for the financial instruments and certain other items that an entity elects to record at fair value will be recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes additional disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  at the effective date  an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date 
the entity shall report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company will not elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist as of january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which changes accounting for business acquisitions 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets and tax benefits 
for ciber  sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december  we are currently evaluating the future impact and required disclosures of this standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 which establishes new standards governing the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests ncis in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
certain provisions of this standard indicate  among other things  that ncis previously referred to as minority interests be treated as a separate component of equity  not as a liability  that increases and decreases in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions  rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses  and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the nci even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance 
this standard also requires changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  the provisions of the standard are to be applied to all ncis prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which are to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the future impact and required disclosures of this standard 
proposed new accounting pronouncement in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
the proposed fsp would require the proceeds from the issuance of such convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the proposed fsp has been delayed  but it is expected to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and would require retrospective application to all periods presented 
if adopted  this fsp would change the accounting treatment for our debentures 
beginning in for financial statements covering past and future periods  it would impact our results of operations as we would record additional non cash interest expense for our debentures 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this issue on our consolidated financial statements in the event that this pronouncement is adopted by the fasb 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources  technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which require management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials  cost plus or fixed price 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from managed services time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements is accounted for pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting only if certain criteria are met 
if such criteria are not met  then combined accounting is applied to all deliverables and all revenue is recognized based on the accounting applicable to the last element to be delivered 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
some software sales arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at june  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the second quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding accounts receivable from the city of new orleans the city 
although we continue to provide services to the city  approximately million of this receivable is related to the hurricane disaster 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we have been informed that fema has so far approved approximately million of our invoices for reimbursement to the city and they began making reimbursements to the city in january we continue to work with the city and fema on the balance 
based on our communications with the city and fema  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
therefore  we have not provided for any reserves related to this balance at december  through february   we have received payments totaling over million from the city 
we cannot be assured that we will be successful in our collection efforts 
should the city s financial condition deteriorate  or should other information arise in the future to indicate that we may not be paid in full  we would have to provide for an appropriate reserve at such time 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets primarily include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during   or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar usd against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
periodically  we enter into cross currency swap arrangements with a financial institution to partially hedge the net assets of certain foreign operations net investment hedges and offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these foreign operations 
increases and decreases in the net investment in our subsidiaries due to foreign exchange volatility will be partially offset by foreign exchange losses and gains from the net investment hedge 
at december   we had net investment hedges in both great britain pounds gbp and in euros 
as of december   the gbp investment hedges had a notional amount of million and a weighted average exchange rate of gbp for each usd 
a change in the value of the usd against the gbp would result in approximately a million change in the value of our hedge instruments 
as of december   the euro investment hedges had a notional amount of million and a weighted average exchange rate of euros for each usd 
a change in the value of the usd against the euro would result in approximately a million change in the value of our hedge instruments 
the hedges mature at varying dates up to september the combined fair value of these net investment hedges at december   was a loss of approximately million 
we transact business in foreign currencies and from time to time  we will enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from inter company transactions  such as loans between foreign entities and or ciber  inc these derivative financial instruments generally have maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk 
we have two outstanding euro usd foreign currency forward contracts at december   with a notional amount of million and a weighted average exchange rate of euros for each usd and which mature in a change in the value of the usd against the euro would result in approximately a  change in the value of our hedge instrument 
the combined fair value of these contracts at december   was a loss of approximately  we also have a gbp usd forward contract to purchase  monthly through june at an exchange rate of gbp for each usd 
fair value of this forward contract was not material at december  we manage credit risk related to our net investment hedges and our foreign exchange forward contracts through careful selection of the financial institution utilized as the counterparty 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our line of credit were million and our interest rate was 
our debentures carry a fixed rate of interest of 
however  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the debentures as early as december  depending upon  among other things  the interest rate environment and the price of our stock at that time 
given current market conditions  we believe that it is likely that we will have to repurchase most or all of the debentures in december as such  we have already begun to repurchase some of the debentures using our revolving credit facilities 
our credit facilities carry floating variable interest rates 
assuming the million is outstanding at a rate of interest of  we would incur annual interest expense of approximately million  as compared to approximately million of annual interest expense at the fixed rate of
