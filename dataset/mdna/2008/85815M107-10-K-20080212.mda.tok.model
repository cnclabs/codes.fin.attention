part i item business general founded in  steelcloud  inc referred to herein as the company  or steelcloud  we  our  ours  and us is a leading manufacturer of embedded integrated computing systems solutions for the federal marketplace and independent software vendors isv s 
we design  manufacture and integrate specialized servers for federal market prime contractors federal integrators and independent software vendors isvs who use the specialized servers to deliver application software to their clients 
we were originally incorporated as dunn computer operating company on july  under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia 
on february   dunn computer corporation dunn was formed and incorporated in the commonwealth of virginia to become a holding company for several entities including dunn computer operating company 
our subsidiary is international data products idp  acquired in may on may   the shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to change the corporate name from dunn computer corporation to steelcloud  inc on december   dunn was merged with and into steelcloud 
on february   we acquired the assets of asgard holding  llc asgard 
in july  as part of its restructuring efforts  we closed our sales office and ceased all of its operations in florida 
our former subsidiaries  puerto rico industrial manufacturing operations acquisition corporation primo  and stms corporation stms  are currently inactive 
unless the context otherwise requires  the company  dunn computer corporation  or steelcloud we  our  ours  and us refers to steelcloud  inc  its predecessor and its subsidiaries 
our principal executive offices are located at park center road  suite herndon  va our main telephone number is inquiries may also be sent to steelcloud at info steelcloud

target market our primary target market is the embedded integrated computing systems  specifically within the industrial automation and military commercial off the shelf cots servers segments 
embedded integrated computing systems are typically defined as purpose built systems that are not visible to the operator and whose primary function is non office application related 
embedded integrated computing systems also tend to be ruggedized for deployment in harsh environments that typical computing systems can not handle 
we utilize multiple channel models  indirect via federal systems integrators and manufacturer representatives and direct to isvs 
we believe that our embedded integrated computing systems are best suited to address the high volume needs of material handling applications such as postal automation 
federal systems integrator federal integrators outsource their specialized requirements to us and consider us to be their virtual hardware engineering division 
we design and manufacture specialized embedded integrated computing systems that are the foundation upon which the integrators develop and deliver their application software 
this allows the integrators to shift their attention away from computing systems hardware and systems software logistics to their core application software and services 
as a result  integrators improve customer satisfaction  shorten time to delivery and lower overall development costs 
we compliment our embedded integrated computing systems  which are often designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions  with software integration  quality testing and program lifecycle management services 
we also provide configuration management  logistics and support services that are unavailable from traditional computer vendors 
manufacturer representatives we supplement our existing public sector sales force by utilizing the services of manufacturer representatives 
manufacturer representatives serve as strategic vehicles for gaining access to key decision makers within major federal integrator organizations 
these companies act as commission based field sales teams that market our products and services to nationally recognized federal contracting companies that mainly target military cots server applications 
in  we signed agreements with three firms newtec representatives  northern computer sales and james r 
johnson associates 
these agreements provide us with first line indirect  federal sales representation in states in the mid atlantic  new england  midwest and great lakes regions 
independent software vendors isv for our isv customers  we are their virtual hardware engineering division 
we create a unique product for the isv by integrating the isv s software onto a specialized appliance platform running linux  freebsd  or one of microsoft s operating systems 
in addition  we augment the isv s internal capabilities by taking responsibility for those tasks necessary to successfully bring an appliance to market  but which are impractical for its software partners to perform 
services include branding  asset tagging  supply chain and inventory management  fulfillment  logistics and program management 
the final isv deliverable is a branded  unique  optimized appliance that is ready to deploy when it arrives at the isv s end customer s site 
our specialized servers and appliances are engineered and developed according to new product realization procedures which are compliant with steelcloud s iso certified quality management system 
professional services we also provide fulltime and contract staffing solutions for information technology it departments 
functioning as virtual employees  our personnel perform work directly under the auspices of client management and serve as an extension to the customer s in house staff resources 
our consultants are subject matter experts in network infrastructure complexities and security technologies including firewalls  content inspection  intrusion detection  spam and vulnerability scanning 
government contracts in fiscal year  we derived approximately of our revenues from sales of hardware and services to us federal  state and local governments 
certain government customers reserve the right to examine our records as they relate to their contracts 
significant customer contract during fiscal year  we were awarded a contract by a major federal customer 
the contract called for us to supply ruggedized systems 
over the seven month contract engagement  during fiscal year  we produced approximately  units and recognized approximately million of revenue associated with this contract 
gsa contract we have a multiple award schedule contract with gsa the gsa contract 
the gsa contract was originally awarded in april it was renewed in fiscal years and  and is valid through march  in august  gsa contract auditors awarded us an outstanding rating for the management and execution of the gsa contract 
the gsa contract enables government it purchasers to acquire all of their needed goods and services from a particular vendor and largely limits the competition to selected vendors holding gsa contracts 
for fiscal year ended  our gsa contract had sales of approximately million  which accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
commercial contracts our commercial customer base consists of several fortune companies as well as medium size commercial customers 
given the nature of the products manufactured as well as the delivery schedules established by our partners  revenue and accounts receivable concentration by any single customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
future revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected should a customer reduce its purchases  eliminate product lines  or choose not to continue to buy products and services from us 
we intend to diversify and increase our commercial customer base in the upcoming fiscal year 
manufacturing and production our manufacturing and production operations are capable of assembling in excess of  systems per year in our existing herndon  virginia facility  on a three shift basis 
production is currently operating on a single shift basis 
in fiscal year  we relocated our office and manufacturing facilities 
we executed non cancelable leases for our new headquarters and operations facilities and commenced occupancy in april our quality management system has been iso certified since april our iso certified quality management system establishes measurable quality objectives throughout the organization and provides procedures for continuous quality improvement in all aspects of our business 
this certification is particularly critical to our success because it promotes continuous improvement in product reliability  on time deliveries  and communication  all of which directly benefit customers and strengthen relationships 
in february  we passed our recertification audit of our entire iso quality management system to ensure that it conforms to the standard 
the recertification further demonstrates our commitment to quality  customer satisfaction and continuous improvement 
the current certification is valid through march marketing we market our products and services to software companies  federal integrators  select commercial accounts  and state  federal  and local government agencies 
we use an in house sales force and program managers to market our products and services 
our products and services are marketed worldwide  either directly through our own sales personnel  or through the marketing organizations of our appliance customers 
strong customer relationships are critical to our success 
we believe that a key to building customer loyalty is a team of knowledgeable and responsive account managers with professional technical and support staff 
we assign each customer a trained account manager  to which subsequent calls to us are directed 
the account manager is augmented with a program manager for our larger customers 
we believe that these strong one on one relationships improve the likelihood the customer may consider us for future purchases 
we intend to continue to provide our customers with products and technical services that offer the customer the best possible return on investment 
we use electronic commerce technologies in our marketing efforts and expect our customers will continue to utilize these technologies 
prospective customers also use the internet to advertise new business opportunities 
we also use the internet to research and reference vendor information 
we maintain an internet website containing its gsa catalogue and product offerings located at www 
steelcloud 
com 
competition the markets for our products and services are highly competitive 
many of our competitors offer broader product lines  have greater economies of scale  and may have more substantial financial  technical  marketing  and other resources 
these competitors may benefit from earlier market entry  volume purchasing advantages  and product and process technology license arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than our arrangements 
the it industry is ever changing 
industry pricing is very aggressive and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
the industry is also characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer preferences  short product life cycles  and evolving industry standards 
we compete with a large number of custom computer manufacturers  resellers and it services companies 
we believe it is likely that these competitive conditions will continue in the future 
there can be no assurance we will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors that may enter markets in which we operate 
our principal competitors in the specialized server markets are companies specializing in building server products and providing some level of integration services 
federal government market we sell our specialized servers to the federal government through federal integrators 
we also sell our server products  engineering services and software products directly to government end users 
software products come from microsoft  ca  mcafee  network general  and others 
in addition  we provide consulting services  consulting project work and staffing services 
sales to the federal government are realized through our own gsa schedule  via the gsa schedules of our strategic partners and through federal government market integrators 
the gsa s federal supply services schedule is a list of pre approved vendors from which the government and or federal agencies may purchase goods and services 
our gsa schedule gs f d is an effective procurement vehicle for us 
we believe the government s criteria for selecting vendors consists of price  quality  familiarity with the vendor  and size and financial capability of the vendor 
the government has increased the amount of it products acquired through the gsa schedule 
our gsa schedule provides the government with a broad range of it products and consulting services 
commercial market the commercial market for our it products and services is highly fragmented  served by thousands of small value added resellers  specialized manufacturers  software companies and consulting services firms 
many of these companies service a small geographic area and resell national brand computers  network hardware  and or software 
our it solutions are differentiated in the commercial and federal government market with technical expertise and professional consulting services 
we believe our professional services group competes effectively in the washington  dc metropolitan market because of our technical know how  market knowledge and name recognition 
in the isv server appliance market  the principal elements of competition are product reliability  quality  customization  price  customer service  technical support  value added services  and product availability 
we distinguish our isv server appliance offerings with specialized services such as engineering design  configuration management  logistics  supply chain management and fulfillment services 
research and development by investing in product development  we believe we will have more control over the functionality and marketing of our products 
we also believe that the resulting intellectual property will increase the competitiveness of our offerings and improve product margins 
during fiscal  we incurred research and development costs of approximately  we will continue to incur costs for product development in the future 
we invest in intellectual property in the form of proprietary products such as steelworks tm 
this appliance management software provides self management and self maintenance functionality to our appliance server offerings and allows our customers to quickly create a fully integrated turnkey appliance server 
we are working to expand steelworks tm to address the needs of small to midsize businesses that require access to company data and attachments via their blackberry handheld device 
this product is called steelworks mobile for the blackberry enterprise server 
this mobile business solution makes a blackberry connection to company data and attachments easy to install and easy to manage 
it is hardware and software in a low cost easy to install solution 
suppliers we devote significant resources to establishing and maintaining relationships with our key suppliers and when possible  purchase directly from component manufacturers such as intel and supermicro 
we also purchase multiple products directly from large national and regional distributors such as synnex  ingram micro  avnet  and bell microproducts 
certain suppliers provide us with incentives in the form of discounts  rebates  credits  cooperative advertising  and market development funds 
we must continue to obtain products at competitive prices from leading suppliers in order to provide competitively priced products for our customers 
we believe our relationships with our key suppliers to be good and believe that generally  there are multiple sources of supply available should the need arise 
in the event we are unable to purchase components from existing suppliers  we have alternative suppliers we can rely upon 
patents  trademarks and licenses we work closely with computer product suppliers and other technology developers to stay abreast of the latest developments in computer technology 
while we do not believe our continued success depends upon the rights to a patent portfolio  there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to existing or new technology for use in our products 
on april   we were issued patent  titled wireless network security 
in addition  we have filed a divisional patent application for remaining claims from this patent now available under new changes in the law 
on april   we were issued patent  titled intrusion detection system using self organizing clusters 
we conduct our business under the trademarks and service marks of steelcloud  steelcloud company and dunn computer corporation 
we believe our copyrights  trademarks and service marks have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products 
employees as of october   we had employees 
of this total  were employed in an executive capacity  in sales and marketing  in administrative capacities  in technical and or services and in operations 
as of january   we had employees 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 
we believe our future success depends in large part upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  technical  and sales personnel 
we have an in house training and mentoring program to develop our own supply of highly qualified technical support specialists 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for our business 
item a 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
in light of the important factors that can materially affect results  including but not limited to those set forth in this paragraph and below  the inclusion of forward looking information herein should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved  we may encounter competitive  technological  financial  economic and business challenges making it more difficult than expected to continue to sell our products and services  we may be unable to retain existing key sales  technical and management personnel  there may be other material adverse changes in the information technology industry or the economy  or in our operations or business  and any or all of these factors may affect our ability to continue our current sales rate or may result in lower sales volume than currently experienced 
assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditure or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the reader is therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained herein  which speak as of the date of this annual report on form k 
we do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any statements to reflect new information or future events or developments 
the reader should carefully consider the following risks 
in addition the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
the risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business 
however  additional risks not presently known  or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
the restatements of our consolidated financial statements may subject us to actions or additional litigation which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in this annual report on form k  we are restating our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal year ended october   the related consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity  and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended october  and october   each of the quarters in fiscal year  and the first three quarters of fiscal year these restatements may result in civil litigation or other actions which could require us to pay fines  other penalties or damages and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the restatements may also result in negative publicity which may cause us to lose or fail to attract and retain key customers  employees and management personnel as a result of these matters 
our internal control and procedures for financial reporting may not ensure that our public filings include timely and reliable financial information 
as discussed in item a  controls and procedures  we identified and reported to the audit committee of our board of directors and to our independent registered public accounting firm a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  as of october  the material weakness was due to the lack of effective policies and procedures surrounding the review and determination of manufacturing cost which should be allocated to inventory and cost of goods sold which contributed to the understatement of inventory and cost of goods sold and overstatement of general and administrative expenses 
as a result of this material weakness  we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of october  the material weakness resulted in adjustments to our inventories  cost of goods sold and general and administrative expense that caused us to restate our audited financial statements for i the year ended october   ii the year ended october  and the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters therein  and iii the unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the nine months ended july  in addition  we restated the selected consolidated financial data in item for the fiscal years ended october     and  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item for the fiscal years ended october     and the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could be limited by a variety of factors  and the remedial measures that we adopted in response to the weakness identified may not be successful to prevent similar events from recurring 
these factors could include the following faulty human judgment and simple error  omission or mistake  fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people  inappropriate override of procedures  and the possibility that our enhanced controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure the timely and accurate preparation of information and the timely filing of our periodic reports with the sec 
a failure to successfully implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  including any ineffectiveness of the remedial measures we have implemented to address the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive 
many of our competitors offer broader product lines and have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  which could seriously harm our net sales and results of operation 
additionally  our competitors may receive beneficial prices from purchasing component parts in large quantities and may be parties to product and process technology licensing arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than our arrangements 
as a result  we may have difficulty increasing or retaining our market share 
rapid change in technology may cause a portion of our inventory to become obsolete 
the computer products market is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and enhancements 
while we strive to maintain a just in time inventory system  certain computer products held in our inventory can become obsolete at any given time  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
in particular  the server appliance market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  potentially short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  which require us to retain  and may require us to hire additional  technically competent personnel 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in installing or implementing new products could seriously damage our business 
we may experience delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products 
our future success depends upon our ability to utilize our creative packaging and hardware and software integration skills to combine industry standard hardware and software to produce low cost  high performance products that satisfy our strategic partners requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
if server appliances are not increasingly adopted as a solution to meet companies computer application needs  the market for our products may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of lower revenues or reduced investor expectations 
we depend on the growing use of server appliances to meet businesses computer application needs 
the market for server appliance products has only recently begun to develop and it is evolving rapidly 
because this market is new  we cannot predict its potential size or future growth rate with a high degree of certainty 
our revenues may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline if the server appliance market does not grow rapidly 
we believe that our expectations for the growth of the server appliance market may not be fulfilled if customers continue to use general purpose servers 
the role of our products could  for example  be limited if general purpose servers become better at performing functions currently being performed by server appliances or are offered at a lower cost 
this could force us to further lower the prices of our products or result in fewer sales of our products 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management personnel including robert e 
frick and kevin murphy  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  respectively 
the loss of either of these individuals or other key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on us 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our industry  and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
there may be significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retention of personnel 
periods of contraction in our business may inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
we are dependent on significant customers 
for our fiscal year ended october   we had generated approximately million or of our total net revenues from contracts with several significant customers 
future revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected should these customers reduce their purchases  eliminate product lines or choose not to continue to buy products and services from us 
given the nature of the products manufactured by us as well as the delivery schedules established by our partners  revenue and accounts receivable concentration by any single customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
if we are unable to continue to participate in government contract programs or if government contracting policies are changed  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
additionally  most government contracts are subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding and our contractual costs and revenues are subject to adjustment as a result of governmental audits 
a significant amount of our revenues are derived from sales made through major procurement programs awarded by the government 
if we are unable to renew or replace existing contracts our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past fluctuated from quarter to quarter and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could be volatile 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of stock  many companies have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we are sued in a securities class action  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our common stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control that may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in response the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock for a profit 
the decline in the market price of our common stock and market conditions generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital  to complete future acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and to attract and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing personnel 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
the listing of our shares of common stock was moved from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq small cap market on june  effective september   the nasdaq small cap market was renamed the nasdaq capital market 
if we are unable to satisfy the nasdaq capital market s continued listing criteria in the future  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
in august  we announced that we received notice  under marketplace rule c the rule  that our common stock was subject to potential delisting from the nasdaq national market because the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum per share requirement for consecutive business days prior to august  under marketplace rule c d  we were granted an initial calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance 
although we were able to regain compliance with marketplace rule c  we cannot guarantee that we will not receive another notice in the future 
if our common stock were delisted from nasdaq  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of our common stock 
additionally  if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
we may issue additional shares of stock and dilute your ownership percentage 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions  or upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options and warrants 
any issuances of additional shares of stock would dilute your ownership percentage in us 
future sales of our common stock in the public market may adversely affect our stock price 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

in addition  net income loss was adjusted for the periods indicated above as a result of allocating direct and indirect costs to inventory 
all referenced amounts in this report for years ended october  and and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis

reclassification beginning may  we began to recognize revenue associated with the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
for comparative purposes  product revenue and cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year and the first two quarters of fiscal year have been reclassified to reflect the effect of recording the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in those prior periods

fiscal year q profit goal accomplishment we successfully accomplished our turnaround plan achieving profitability for the fourth quarter of fiscal year this accomplishment was achieved by devoting attention to growing our business in markets our existing expertise and contacts can be leveraged  by concentrating efforts on efficient problem solving and cost effective solutions 
we generated net revenues of approximately million for the three months ending october  compared to million for the same period in fiscal year  an increase of approximately 
net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year were approximately  compared to a loss of approximately  for the same period in fiscal year management change in august  our board of directors appointed robert e 
frick as our executive director 
the appointment was part of the transition plan that we initiated in when cliff sink  was charged to lead us to a return to profitability and an increased share price 
also in august  we entered into an employment resignation agreement with cliff sink pursuant to which mr 
sink resigned his positions as our president  chief executive officer and board member effective november  on november   mr 
frick assumed all leadership responsibilities as president and chief executive officer and was appointed to the board of directors to fill the vacancy created by mr 
sink s resignation 
significant customer contracts during fiscal year  we were awarded a contract by a major federal customer 
the contract called for us to supply ruggedized systems 
over the seven month contract engagement  during fiscal year  we produced approximately  units and recognized approximately million of revenue associated with this contract 
nasdaq notices on august   we announced that we had received notice  under marketplace rule c the rule  that our common stock was subject to potential delisting from the nasdaq national market because the bid price of our common stock closed below the minimum per share requirement for consecutive business days prior to august  on january   we regained compliance under nasdaq marketplace rule c d as the closing bid price of our common stock exceeded for ten consecutive business days 
significant customers during fiscal year  contracts with two customers  a federal customer and a commercial customer  represented million and million of our net revenues or and of total net revenues  respectively  for the year 
given the nature of the products manufactured by us as well as the delivery schedules established by our partners  revenue and accounts receivable concentration by any single customer will fluctuate from year to year 
future revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected should these customers reduce its purchases  eliminate product lines or choose not to continue to buy products and services from us 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note significant accounting policies to our financial statements 
some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and or subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  corrected copy sab 
generally  sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   we have adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
issued in december by the financial accounting standards board fasb  eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
in the event we enter into a multiple element arrangement and there are undelivered elements as of the balance sheet date  we assess whether the elements are separable and have determinable fair value in determining the amount of revenue to record 
beginning in may   we began to recognize revenue associated with the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  and interpretations thereof 
for comparative purposes  product revenue and cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years and have been reclassified to reflect the effect of recording the resale of maintenance contracts on a net basis in those prior years 
we derive our revenue from the following sources product sales  information technology support services  software license as a reseller and support sales and software training and implementation services 
for product sales where title transfers upon shipment and risk of loss transfers to our customer  we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
for product sales where title and risk of loss transfers upon destination  we generally recognize revenue when products reach their destination 
revenue from hardware leased to customers under operating lease arrangements is recognized over the contract term 
when product and installation services that are not essential to the functionality of the product are sold as part of a bundled agreement  the fair value of the installation services  based on the price charged for the services when sold separately  is deferred and recognized when the services are performed 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty ranging from one to three years 
we accrue an estimated warranty reserve in the period of sale to provide for estimated costs associated with providing warranty services 
for services revenue under time and material contracts  we recognize revenue as services are provided based on the hours of service at stated contractual rates 
we are also a value added solution provider for certain software products 
when resold software licenses and related maintenance  customization  and training services are all provided together to an individual customer  we recognize revenue for the arrangement after we have delivered the software license and the customer has approved all implementation and training services provided 
in instances where we only resell the software license and maintenance to the customer  we recognize revenue after the customer has acknowledged and accepted delivery of the software 
the software manufacturer is responsible for providing software maintenance 
accordingly  revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized upon delivery or acceptance  as we have no future obligation to provide the maintenance services and no right of return exists 
we incur shipping and handling costs  which are recorded in cost of revenues 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from certain customer contracts  isv releases  warranties  hardware maintenance and support  and consulting services 
the deferred revenue associated with customer contracts and isv releases represents payments received for milestones achieved prior to recognition of revenue 
this revenue will be recognized as products are shipped 
revenues from warranties and hardware maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the service term selected by the customer 
deferred service revenues from consulting are recognized as the services are performed 
equity based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r on november  issued in december by the fasb  sfas no 
r requires that the fair value compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of the stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 
r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for amortizing our stock option and espp awards 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding are measured at their estimated fair value 
prior to november   we accounted for employee stock option grants using the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and accordingly associated compensation expense  if any  was measured as the excess of the underlying stock price over the exercise price on the date of grant 
we also complied with the disclosure option of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and made pro forma footnote disclosures 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of certain assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established  as necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets an amount expected to be realized in future periods 
we determine our valuation allowance pursuant to the provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence including past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our valuation allowance to fully reserve for all deferred tax assets  which caused us to recognize income tax expense of  in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance as of october   we considered  in particular  our forecasted taxable income for the upcoming fiscal year  current backlog of orders  including those recently received  and other significant opportunities currently in our sales and marketing pipeline with a high probability of generating revenues 
based upon this review  we have continued to fully reserve for all deferred tax assets as of october  inventory inventory consists of materials and components used in the assembly of our products or maintained to support maintenance and warranty obligations and are stated at the lower of cost or market using actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and actual cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventory until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
we periodically evaluate our inventory obsolescence to ensure inventory is recorded at its net realizable value 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
inherent in managements estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are management s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence and possible alternative uses 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  the sale of our specialized servers includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the systems 
we offer warranties for our systems that typically cover a period of one to three years that commences upon shipment of the system to the customer 
when appropriate  we record a reserve for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to the established reserves 
actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to the reserve in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
segment reporting fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
sfas no 
also establishes a quantitative threshold  whereby an enterprise should report separately information about an operating segment if its reported revenue is percent or more of the combined revenue of all reported operating segments 
we are organized on the basis of products and services 
however  we do not evaluate the performance of our operating components and units based on earnings 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer 
while the chief executive officer is apprised of a variety of financial metrics and information  the chief executive officer makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance based on a single operating unit 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
eitf concluded that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  such as sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes  is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed in a company s financial statements 
in addition  companies that record such taxes on a gross basis should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the guidance is effective for financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we collect and remit sales and property taxes on products and services that we purchase and sell under our contracts with customers  and report such amounts under the net method in our consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  there are no sales and property taxes included in gross revenue and therefore disclosure will not be required 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
this pronouncement recommends a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a choice to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires disclosures about the election of the fair value option 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  therefore  we are required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have our financial statements

fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage products services total net revenues the decrease in product revenue is the result of our transitioning out of the reseller business to focus on the federal integrator and isv businesses  our core business 
we experienced approximately a decrease in reseller revenue for the twelve month period ended october  compared to the same period in fiscal year the reseller revenue decrease was replaced by increases in our isv and integrator business 
our revenues from our isv and integrator business increased by approximately and  respectively for fiscal year compared to fiscal year higher demand by new and existing customers throughout generated the increase in the isv sales  and the increase in integrator revenue is attributable to deliveries associated with a significant contract with a federal customer during fiscal year  which was valued at approximately million 
the decrease in service revenues for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to the same period in fiscal is the result of our successful transition away from the reseller business as well as our not accepting incremental revenue  in order to maintain higher margins 
as a result  we are serving the market directly rather than through our strategic partners 
during fiscal year  we refocused our services business on the local washington dc technology market which has resulted in a temporary decline in revenues 
we expect service revenue to grow in the future as we refocus our service offerings 
gross profit discussion the following table summarizes our gross profit for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars  as a percentage of gross profit and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  restated increase decrease of gross of gross dollars profit dollars profit dollars percentage products products gp services services gp total gross profit total gp the increase in product gross profit is the direct result our successful transition away from the reseller business  which historically yielded lower margins 
for the twelve months ended october  reseller revenue represented approximately of our net product revenues compared to approximately for the twelve months ended october  during fiscal year  we incurred costs of approximately  to write down the inventoried costs of end of life products 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to continue to fluctuate as product lines expand  new products are brought to market  start up costs are incurred and new discounts  incentives and rebates become available 
the increase in services gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the combination of our successful transition away from the third party solutions business and our fiscal year restructuring efforts 
as a result  we are selling services directly to the market rather than through our strategic partners 
in addition  the increase is the result of improved utilization of the staff available for service contracts 
we anticipate gross profit for services to fluctuate in future quarters as a result of refocusing our service offerings 
operating expense discussion the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues

during the second half of fiscal year  we began the process of eliminating unsuccessful business activities to focus and reinvest in our core business  the federal integrator and isv markets 
we will continue to evaluate our costs relative to our revenues and gross profits 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the cost reductions that were initiated during the third quarter of fiscal year the cost reductions included curtailing expenses related to non revenue generating activities  terminating non essential employees  and instituting an across the board departmental expense reduction 
the decrease is also the result of costs of approximately  associated with the amendment and termination of the employment contract of our then president during the second quarter of fiscal year our cost reductions were offset by an increase of approximately  in non cash stock compensation expense for fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal year although we continue to manage our costs relative to our revenues and gross profits  additional resources may be required in order to invest in our core federal integrator and isv business 
research and product development expense for the twelve months ended october  was consistent with the same period in fiscal year the decrease in impairment of goodwill charges is the result of our recognizing an impairment loss of approximately  in fiscal in order to write down the carrying value of our goodwill to our estimated fair value 
as of october   we no longer have any goodwill or other intangible balances associated with acquisitions on our balance sheet 
the decrease in the amortization expense is the result of our reducing the carrying value of our other intangible assets to our estimated fair value during fiscal year as of october   we have no goodwill or other intangible assets associated with acquisitions on our balance sheet 
the decrease in severance and restructuring charges for the twelve months ended october  compared to the twelve months ended october  is the result of incurring non recurring costs associated with the closing of our florida office in the amount of  severance payments as a result of restructuring in the amount of  and expenses associated with the separation agreement entered into with our founder and former ceo  in the amount of  during fiscal year in fiscal year  we incurred approximately  of non recurring costs associated with the employment resignation agreement entered into with our previous ceo  cliff sink

fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage interest income net other expense  net total other expense income the decrease in interest income for the twelve month period ended october  is attributable to additional interest expense associated with the recording of severance payments at net present value  offset by lower interest income compared to the same period in fiscal year our interest income for the twelve month period ended october  was lower than the comparable period in fiscal year due to lower cash on hand during the twelve months ended october  the decrease in other expense for fiscal year is attributable to the non recurring legal and professional services fees resulting from the investigation of an attempted exercise of certain employee stock options incurred during fiscal year provision for income tax discussion the following table summarizes our provision for income tax for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage total provision for income taxes for the twelve month period ended october   we recognized  in income tax expense due to the adjustment of our tax valuation allowance 
as a result of the adjustment  our deferred tax assets were  and remain  fully reserved 
net loss discussion the following table summarizes our net loss for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  restated increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage net loss the decrease in net loss for the twelve months ended october  as compared to the same period in fiscal is the result of our fiscal year restructuring activities and continuing to manage our costs relative to our revenue during the twelve months ended october  compared to the same period in fiscal year in addition  we incurred significant  one time  non recurring expenses during fiscal year compared to fiscal year significant  one time  non recurring expenses for fiscal year included approximately  of charges incurred to write down our goodwill and other intangible assets to their carrying value   in severance and restructuring charges   of non recurring legal and professional services fees   in costs associated with the termination of an employment contract with our former president who resigned in june   in income tax expense due to the adjustment of the tax valuation allowance and approximately  in expense for inventory obsolescence primarily associated with end of life products 
significant  one time  non recurring expenses incurred during fiscal year included approximately  in severance charges 
we successfully accomplished our turnaround plan achieving profitability for the fourth quarter of fiscal year as mentioned in footnote quarterly financial information in the notes to the financial statements  we generated net earnings of approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  net revenue discussion the following table summarizes our net revenue for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage products services total net revenues the decrease in product revenue is primarily attributable to the completion of several significant contracts with one federal integrator during fiscal year and the lack of comparable orders or contracts in fiscal we recognized revenue of approximately million associated with this integrator for the twelve month period ended october  compared to approximately million during the same period in fiscal year partially offsetting the decrease was higher demand for isv products generated by new and existing customers throughout and an increase in third party software solution products  where we act as a reseller  as a result of our engaging new channel partners during the first half of fiscal although third party software solution product revenue increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  we have begun to transition away from the third party solution business  which typically carries lower margins  and focus on the federal integrator and isv businesses  our core business 
as a result  we expect total revenue to decrease during the first half of fiscal as revenues associated with the lower margin  third party software sales continue to decrease 
we have begun to focus on improving our isv and integrator revenues but do not anticipate total net revenue to increase until late fiscal due to the long sales cycles associated with these markets 
the decrease in service revenue is primarily the result of the completion of certain long term contracts in fiscal coupled with a lack of new service contracts in fiscal to replace this revenue 
during fiscal  we expected certain revenue levels from our partnerships that never materialized 
consequently  we have determined to serve this market directly rather than through our strategic partners 
in addition  service revenue associated with the acquisition of asgard  decreased to approximately  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year as a result of closing the florida office in fiscal year gross profit discussion the following table summarizes our gross profit for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars  as a percentage of gross profit and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  restated restated increase decrease of gross of gross dollars profit dollars profit dollars percentage products products gp services services gp total gross profit total gp the decrease in product gross profit is primarily due to the completion of significant contracts in fiscal gross profits on long term contracts historically increase throughout the contract life cycle and are typically at their highest point near the end of the contract 
margins increase throughout the contract due to the incurrence of start up costs at contract initiation 
in addition  the purchasing power for larger contracts enables us to reduce our materials costs throughout the contract 
the decrease can also be attributed to the growth in third party software solution product revenues during the first half of fiscal  which traditionally have lower gross profits  compared to the same period in we also incurred costs of approximately  to write down the inventoried costs of end of life products during fiscal year we announced these product life ends and do not anticipate additional write downs relating to these products 
although we expect gross profits to increase as we transition away from the low margin  third party solution business  we expect gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as product lines expand  new products are brought to market  start up costs are incurred  and new discounts  incentives and rebates become available 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue is attributable to investments in technical consultant staff  the use of resources to develop our higher margin  project based service offerings as well as our continuing to support partnership requirements by maintaining certified and available resources for immediate deployment for potential contracts 
as previously mentioned  expected service revenues from certain partnerships never materialized 
we anticipate gross profit for services to increase in future quarters as a result of our restructuring efforts whereby we will sell services directly and better utilize our individual consultants available for contracts 
operating expense discussion the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the fiscal years ended october  and in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended october  restated restated increase decrease of net of net dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars percentage selling and marketing general and administrative research and product development impairment of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets severance and restructuring costs total operating expenses the increase in selling and marketing expense is the result of deploying additional sales personnel in order to increase brand recognition and our customer base 
for the first half of fiscal  we made investments in areas outside our core business that did not return the expected results 
during the second half of fiscal year  we took steps to eliminate unsuccessful business activities  specifically the resale of certain third party solutions  to focus and reinvest in our core business  the federal integrator and isv markets 
although we anticipate selling and marketing expenses to increase as new products and services are introduced  we will continue to evaluate our costs relative to our revenues and gross profits 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of approximately  of costs associated with the amendment and termination of the employment contract of our former president during fiscal year this increase was offset due to our cost cutting efforts that took place during the second half of fiscal year these cost reductions included curtailing expenses related to non revenue generating activities  terminating non essential employees  and instituting an across the board departmental expense reduction 
although we continue to manage our costs relative to our revenues and gross profits  additional resources will be required in order to invest in our core federal integrator and isv business 
the decrease in research and product development expense is the result of our restructuring activities  specifically the termination of the audit compliance system acs project during fiscal year as mentioned in note commitments  we closed our florida office during fiscal year and transitioned all remaining research and development activities to its corporate office where we will continue to make investments in research and development to maintain and grow current products 
the decrease is also attributable to certain product development resources being used for sales support activities during fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal we believe that research and development expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as new products are being developed and introduced into the marketplace 
the impairment of goodwill charge during the third quarter of fiscal year was the result of determining a triggering event had occurred under sfas as described in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  management re assessed the recoverability of goodwill carried on the financial statements and determined goodwill and other intangible assets were fully impaired 
consequently  we recognized an impairment loss of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal in order to write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the estimated fair value 
as of october   we no longer have any goodwill or other intangible assets associated with acquisitions on our balance sheet 
the severance and restructuring charge during fiscal year is the result of non recurring costs associated with the closing of our florida office in the amount of  as described in note management change  restructuring and operations  severance payments as a result of our restructuring in the amount of  and expenses associated with the separation agreement entered into with our former chief executive officer ceo  in the amount of  the separation agreement provided for the former ceo to resign as chairman and member of our board of directors 
simultaneous with the resignation  we entered into a month consulting arrangement whereby the former ceo will provide certain advisory services to our board of directors and management team during the transition 
under the terms of the agreement  the former ceo shall receive approximately  months at his former base salary of  per annum 
in addition  we will continue to provide health and dental coverage for the former ceo and his family  a leased car for his use and the transfer of a company automobile in exchange for forgiveness of certain accounts payable that we owe to the former ceo and his family 
the resignation was made in response to the results of an investigation by the audit committee of the board relating to matters associated with the attempted exercise of certain employee stock options owned by the former ceo 
the matter was discovered through the operation of our internal controls and procedures and did not result in any direct financial loss or have any direct effect on our financial statements
