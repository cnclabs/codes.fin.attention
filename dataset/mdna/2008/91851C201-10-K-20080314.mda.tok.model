item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame  avouma and south tchibala fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
production commenced from the etame field in and was subsequently expanded through additional development wells in and in  the company developed the avouma and south tchibala fields by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
oil production commenced from the avouma and south tchibala fields in january the company s results of operations and financial condition are affected by currency exchange rates 
while oil sales are denominated in us dollars  portions of the operating costs in gabon  angola and great britain are denominated in the local currency 
an increase in the exchange rate of the local currency to the dollar will have the effect of increasing operating costs while a decrease in the exchange rate will reduce operating costs 
the primary operating costs are at the company s producing fields in gabon where the local currency is tied to the euro 
the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions  general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
the euro appreciated substantially against the us dollar in and

index to financial statements critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
for financial accounting purposes  the company adopted sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred by capitalizing it as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with accounting under successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
suspended well costs under the successful efforts method of accounting used by the company for its oil and gas exploration and development costs  all expenditures related to exploration  with the exception of costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of exploratory wells are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether commercially producible oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
if the determination is made that a well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are charged to expense 
these determinations are re evaluated quarterly 
for capitalized exploration drilling costs  if it is determined that a development plan is feasible  and the development plan is approved by the gabon government  costs associated with the exploratory wells will be transferred along with the costs spent on the development to wells  platforms and other production facilities at the time of first production 
the costs will subsequently be amortized on a unit of production based method over the life of the reserves as they are produced 
in the event it were determined that the discoveries are not commercial  the costs of the exploratory wells would be expensed 
for offshore exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory well costs remain suspended while additional appraisal and engineering work on the potential oil and gas field is performed and regulatory and government approvals are sought 
in gabon  the government must approve the commerciality of the reserves  assign a development area and approve a formal development plan prior to a field being developed

index to financial statements on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  which addressed a discussion that was ongoing within the oil industry regarding capitalization of costs of drilling exploratory wells 
paragraph of fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies fasb no 
 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if the well has found proved reserves  the capitalized costs become part of the entity s wells  equipment  and facilities 
if  however  the well has not found proved reserves  the capitalized costs of drilling the well are expensed 
questions arose in practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles 
the issue was whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs if reserves cannot be classified as proved within one year following the completion of drilling  other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future 
fsp fas amends fasb no 
to allow for the continued capitalization of suspended well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the plan 
in december the company spudded a well of block b in the british north sea 
the well was suspended as a non commercial discovery in january accordingly the company expensed as exploration expense all costs incurred through december  the company also anticipates expensing the additional costs incurred while drilling the well in january  which are estimated to be approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to its oil and gas production 
sales prices are primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
interest rate market risk at december   total debt was million 
the debt is tied to floating or market interest rates 
fluctuations in floating interest rates will cause the company s annual interest costs to fluctuate 
during the fourth quarter of  the interest rate on the company s bank debt averaged 
if the balance of the bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a change in market interest rates would impact our cash flow by an estimated  per quarter 
commodity risk in  the company utilized derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of its oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure to adverse price fluctuations of oil 
the derivatives were not held for trading purposes 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that the company has used are collars  which the company generally places with major investment grade financial institutions believed to have minimal credit risks 
the company had no derivatives in place in or or as of the date of this report
