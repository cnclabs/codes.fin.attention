nlasco operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries  nlic and asic 
given the homogeneity of our products  the regulatory environments in which we operate  the nature of our customers and our distribution channels  we now monitor  control and manage our business lines as an integrated entity offering fire and homeowners insurance to low value dwellings and manufactured homes primarily in texas and other areas of the south  southeastern and southwestern united states 
accordingly  the segment information previously provided is no longer used to monitor us  as we only have insurance company segment information to disclose 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we have summarized below those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on information currently available to management and on various other assumptions management believes are reasonable 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we measure our assets of discontinued operations held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell at the balance sheet date and re cast any applicable balances and corresponding liabilities related to the discontinued operations in all comparable periods presented 
depreciation of the assets held for sale  if applicable  is suspended at the date of the determination of discontinuance 
interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of the assets of discontinued operations as held for sale continues to be accrued 
the results of operations and cash flows of the assets sold and those classified as held for sale are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we recognize any estimated losses on the sales of assets of discontinued operations in the period in which the operations are discontinued and recognize any resulting gains on the sales of assets when realized 
a description of the facts and circumstances leading to the expected disposal  the expected manner and timing of that disposal  and  if not separately presented on the face of the balance sheet  the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
we disclose in the notes to our financial statements and on the face of the income statement the gain or loss recognized in accordance with sfas and  if applicable  the amounts of revenue and pretax profit or loss reported in discontinued operations 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily on a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss adjustment expenses are determined using historical information by line of business as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is ordinarily implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends  and reviews of historical reserving results over multiple years 
when a claim is reported  a case reserve is established for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and the experience and knowledge of the company 
the estimate considers the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we maintain incurred but not reported  ibnr  reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and developments on reported claims 
the ibnr reserve is estimated based on the volume of premiums written and is reviewed quarterly by third party actuaries 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while management believes that the amount is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided 
the methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are continually reviewed  and any adjustments are reflected in earnings currently 
the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses has not been reduced for reinsurance recoverables 
investment securities 
at december   investment securities consist of us government  mortgage backed  corporate debt and equity securities 
we classify our fixed maturities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
our equity securities are classified as trading or available for sale 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity debt securities are those securities in which we have the ability  and intent  to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of trading and available for sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
the company regularly reviews its investment securities to assess whether the amortized cost is impaired and if impairment is other than temporary 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether impairment is other than temporary  the company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end  and forecasted performance of the investee 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held to maturity or available for sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
deferred acquisition costs 
costs of acquiring insurance vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of new and renewal business  primarily consisting of commissions  premium taxes and underwriting expenses  are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they relate 
proceeds from reinsurance transactions that represent recovery of acquisition costs reduce applicable unamortized acquisition costs in a manner that net acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to net revenue recognized 
future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
the company regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset 
a premium deficiency  and a corresponding charge to income  is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceed related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
at december   there was no premium deficiency 
revenue recognition 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
the company routinely evaluates the premium receivable balance to determine if an allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
other income consists of premium installment charges  which are recognized when earned  and other miscellaneous income 
reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  the company seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
net premiums earned  losses and lae and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are reported net of the amounts related to reinsurance ceded to other companies 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers related the portions of the liability for losses and lae are reported as assets 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reinsured policy 
the company accounts for reinsurance contracts under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance on short duration and long duration contracts  or sfas net premiums earned  losses and lae  and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are reported net of the amounts related to reinsurance ceded to other companies 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the portions of the liability for losses and lae and unearned premiums ceded to them are reported as assets 
reinsurance assumed from other companies  including assumed premiums written and earned and losses and lae  is accounted for in the same manner as direct insurance written 
income taxes 
in and prior years  we operated in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income to its stockholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which it distributes to its stockholders 
in we revoked our election as a reit for u 
s 
federal income tax purposes 
we have been in a taxable loss position since our inception and as a result we have substantial net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income and capital gains from the sale of discontinued assets 
we have established a tax provision under the rules set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  beginning on january  we allocate income taxes between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with sfas  specifically paragraph income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects related to the temporary difference between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we do not recognize any portion of the benefits in our consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin resulted in no change to the january  balance of retained deficit 
our policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets  including net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized 
at december  and  a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be recoverable 
from time to time  management must assess the need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments from various federal  state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit the company in the normal course of business 
in making these assessments  management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill for hth represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the assets of nlasco 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill

premiums 
the property and casualty insurance industry is affected by soft and hard market business cycles 
during a soft market  price competition tends to increase as insurers are willing to reduce premium rates in order to maintain growth in premium volume 
the soft market makes it more difficult to attract new business as well as retain exposures which are adequately priced 
although we recognize the need to remain competitive in the marketplace  the company remains committed to its disciplined underwriting philosophy accepting only risks that are appropriately priced  while declining risks which are under priced for the level of coverage provided

as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  consisting of approximately million owned by the parent company and million owned by nlasco and its subsidiaries 
at december   we had total investments of approximately million  consisting investments in available for sale equities of with a fair value of million  and approximately million in fixed maturities and equity securities owned by nlasco and its subsidiaries 
this is compared to million of cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations at december  as of december   we had approximately million of debt  consisting of approximately million of senior exchangeable notes and approximately million of debt owed by nlasco and its subsidiaries 
our short term liquidity needs as of december  include a funds for dividend payments on the million series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock bearing a dividend rate of per annum approximately million annually  b funds to pay claims of nlasco and subsidiaries  c funds to service the million of senior exchangeable notes  and d funds to service the debt owed by nlasco and its subsidiaries 
our insurance operating subsidiary  nlasco  has primary investment objectives to preserve capital and manage for a total rate of return in excess of a specified benchmark portfolio 
nlasco s strategy is to purchase securities in sectors that represent the most attractive relative value 
bonds  cash and short term investments constituted million  or  of nlasco s million in investments at december  nlasco had million  or of its investments  in equity investments as of december  nlasco has no investments in subprime mortgages 
nlasco has custodial agreements with ag edwards and wells fargo bank and an investment management agreement with hyperion brookfield asset management  inc nlasco liquidity requirements are met primarily by positive cash flow from operations and investment activity 
primary sources of cash from insurance operations are premiums and other considerations  net investment income and investment sales and maturities 
primary uses of cash include payments of claims  operating expenses and income taxes and purchases of investments 
nlasco s insurance subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can declare 
nlasco s investment committee meets regularly to review the portfolio performance and investment markets in general 
our management generally meets monthly to review the performance of investments and monitor market conditions for investments that would warrant any revision to investment guidelines 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations and dividends from our insurance companies  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs for the reasonably foreseeable future 
we will continue to pursue and investigate possible strategic investments 
in that regard  we may need to secure external financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing or in the implementation of our business plan 
see item a 
risk factors starting on page restrictions on dividends and distributions aside from investment income on our invested assets  as a holding company we rely on dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends from our insurance subsidiaries nlic and asic are subject to significant regulatory restrictions and limitations under debt agreements limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
under texas state insurance law for property and casualty companies  all dividends must be distributed out of earned surplus only 
furthermore  without the prior approval of the commissioner  dividends cannot be declared or distributed which exceed the greater of ten percent of the company s surplus  as shown by its last statement on file with the commissioner  or one hundred percent of net income for such period 
nlic and asic did not pay any dividends to nlasco during the eleven months ended december  at december   the maximum aggregate dividend that may be paid from nlic and aisc to nlasco in without regulatory approval is approximately million 
regulations of the texas department of insurance require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of statutory surplus to ensure their ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
at december   nlasco s insurance subsidiaries had statutory surplus in excess of the minimum required 
also  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital  or rbc  requirements for insurance companies that establish minimum capital requirements relating to insurance risk  credit risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the formula is used by the naic and certain state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify companies that require additional scrutiny or regulatory action 
at december   the company s insurance subsidiaries rbc ratio exceeded the level at which regulatory action would be requirements 
we believe that restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies will not have a material impact on our ability to carry out our normal business activities  including dividend payments on our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock and debt payments on our senior exchangeable notes 
cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash used by operations was million in  as compared to million provided by operations in cash used in operations decreased primarily because of the sale of the manufactured housing business and subsequent reclass to discontinued operations  and the million payment for taxes related to the gain in connection with the farallon transaction 
cash provided by investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash from investing activities primarily was due to proceeds from discontinued operations of million  cash acquired in the nlasco purchase of million  proceeds of securities sold and matured of million  partially offset by million in cash used in the nlasco acquisition and million used to purchase securities 
in we invested million in the nlasco acquisition and million was generated from sales of discontinued assets 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with million used by financing activities in the increase in cash from financing activities primarily was due the common stocks rights offering in of million and the issuance of million in common stock 
this was partially offset by the million paid to op unit holders  the million payment of preferred dividends  the million reduction in debt  and million used to pay debt related to discontinued operations 
in  we made debt payments related to discontinued operations of million  and paid million in preferred dividends 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operations was million and million in and  respectively 
in there was a million gain on discontinued operations compared to a loss of million in cash provided by investing activities in was million  compared to million used by investing activities in the increase in cash from investing activities in was due to proceeds from sales of discontinued assets of million compared to purchases of assets related to discontinued operation of million in in million was used by financing activities  compared with million provided by financing activities in the decrease in cash from financing activities in was primarily due to repayment of million in discontinued operations debt  compared to the proceeds from issuance of debt related to discontinued operations of million 
cash proceeds from were partially reduced by payment of million in dividends on common stock and op units  the million payment of preferred dividends  million of cash spent to repurchase op units and ppus  and million in cash used related to loan origination costs 
inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years  it remains a factor in the us economy and may increase the cost of labor and utilities 
commitments at december   we have million of outstanding indebtedness 
it consists of the following million  or  of our total indebtedness is fixed rate and million  or  is variable rate 
at december   we had the following indebtedness outstanding with the following repayment obligations in thousands principal commitments interest commitments total debt commitments fixed variable total fixed variable total fixed variable total thereafter      commitments      for variable rate debt  interest commitments were calculated as expected interest payments based on the weighted average interest rate 
at december  the following table shows our outstanding commitments for leases in thousands

however  based on historical payment patterns  the following table estimates when management expects the loss reserves to be paid 
the timing of payments is subject to significant uncertainty

sfas provides a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
sfas is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas  or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent our long term measurement objectives of accounting for financial instruments 
sfas is effective for companies with fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r broadens the guidance of sfas  extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
it broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
sfas r expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective for all transactions entered into on or after january  we do not believe sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
sfas is effective on january  we do not believe sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december  our total debt outstanding was million  comprised of approximately million of indebtedness subject to fixed interest rates 
approximately million  or  of our total consolidated debt is variable rate debt 
if libor and the prime rate were to increase by one eighth of one percent  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately  annually 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
the fair value of debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million
