we utilize these client conferences to reach out to existing and potential customers and business partners  provide training and educational services  and demonstrate our new and existing product offerings 
we have marketing teams that are responsible for these initiatives and for working with  and supporting  our product managers and sales teams 
operations we believe our ability to establish and maintain long term customer relationships  adoption of our products and services  recurring sales  and development and maintenance of new and existing products are dependent on the strength of our operations  customer service  product development and maintenance  training  and other support teams 
as of december   these personnel consisted of approximately employees for learning and approximately employees for research  of which were employed on a part time basis 
our learning operations team consists of personnel associated with customer support  implementation services  product development and maintenance  training  and project management 
our research operations team consists of personnel associated with phone interviewing  distributing and processing paper based survey instruments  data analysis and reporting of survey results  and project management 
technology management our services are designed to be secure  reliable  and expandable

this combination of software supports acquisition and conversion of content  hosting and management of that content  publication of our web sites  downloads of courseware  registration  tracking of users  and reporting of information for both internal and external use 
we designed our services to allow each component to be independently scaled by adding commercially available hardware and a combination of commercially available and proprietary software components 
our network infrastructure  web sites  and servers that deliver most of our services are hosted by third party providers 
our primary data center and hosting facility is in chicago  while a second data center and hosting facility is located in nashville with a separate vendor

our providers hosting centers are connected to the internet through multiple  redundant high speed fiber optic circuits 
our survey products are hosted on servers located at our franklin  tennessee and laurel  maryland offices 
company personnel monitor all servers  networks  and systems on a continuous basis 
together with our providers  we employ several levels of enterprise firewall systems to protect our databases  customer information  and courseware library 
backups of customer data are performed on a daily basis 
data is secured at a remote location on a weekly basis 
competition the healthcare education industry is highly fragmented  varies significantly in delivery methods ie  written materials  live events  satellite broadcasts  video  cd rom products and online products  and is composed of a wide variety of entities competing for customers 
the sheer volume of healthcare information available to satisfy continuing education needs  rapid advances in medical developments  and the time constraints that healthcare professionals face make it difficult to quickly and efficiently access the continuing education content most relevant to an individual s practice or profession 
historically  healthcare professionals have received continuing education and training through offline publications  such as medical journals and cd roms  and by attending conferences and seminars 
in addition  other healthcare workers and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers sales and internal regulatory personnel usually fulfill their education and training needs through instructor led programs from external vendors or internal training departments 
while these approaches satisfy the ongoing education and training requirements  they are typically costly and inconvenient 
in addition  live courses are often limited in the breadth of offerings and do not provide a method for tracking training completion 
the related results of these traditional methods  both from a business and compliance standpoint  are difficult to track and measure 
while hospitals and 
table of contents health systems occasionally survey their patients  physicians and employees using their own internal resources  the practice is limited since the do not typically possess valuable comparative benchmarking data which is available from independent survey research vendors 
in addition to the competing delivery methods described above  we also have direct competitors 
a number of companies offer competitive installed and web based learning management products to the healthcare industry 
we also compete with learning management system providers such as saba and sumtotal systems that provide their services to multiple industries  including healthcare 
we also compete with large medical publishers that have operating units that offer learning management systems that focus on healthcare  including cengage learning s net learning and reed elsevier group s mc strategies 
in the survey business  we see competition from large nationally recognized survey research firms such as press ganey associates  national research corporation  gallup  and others 
our survey business also experiences direct competition from vendors who provide survey research services to other industries including kenexa and foresight 
finally  recently we have also seen an increase in a teaming approach between consulting and technology entities to address larger scale projects 
we believe our learning solutions  which include both products and services that facilitate training for healthcare professionals  a wide assortment of courseware  a mechanism for measuring satisfaction or other results  and the ability to provide all our services on a single platform over the internet  provide us with a competitive advantage 
in our survey research business  we believe our large proprietary database of physician survey results  technology infrastructure designed to automate the processing of survey results  proprietary core survey instruments and action plan development methodology  and our ability to quickly deliver relevant online courseware targeted at addressing survey related findings provide us with a competitive advantage 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the marketing of information  training and development services to the healthcare industry include l features of the hlc product  including reporting  management functionality  ability to manage a variety of events or modalities  courseware assignment  scalability  and the ability to track utilization and results  l scope and variety of internet based learning courseware available  including mandated content for osha  the joint commission  patient safety  and hipaa requirements  competency based content  as well as the ability of our customers to create and host their own web enabled courseware  l scope and quality of professional services offered  including survey execution  implementation  benchmarking  training and the expertise and technical knowledge of the customers employees  l competitive pricing  which supports a return on investment when compared to other alternative delivery methods  l customer service and support  l effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts  and l company reputation 
collectively  we believe these capabilities provide us with the ability to improve the quality of healthcare by developing the people who deliver care 
government regulation of the internet and the healthcare industry the internet the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
the united states government and the governments of some states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the internet 
the following are some of the evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business l privacy and security law 
current and proposed federal  state and foreign privacy and security regulations and other laws restricting the collection  use  security and disclosure of personal information could limit our ability to collect information or use the information in our databases or derived from other sources to generate revenues 
it may be costly to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
l encryption laws 
many copyright owner associations have lobbied the federal government for laws requiring copyrighted materials transmitted over the internet to be digitally encrypted in order to track rights and prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted materials 
if these laws are adopted  we may incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements or change the way we do business 
l content regulation 
both foreign and domestic governments have adopted and proposed laws governing the content of material transmitted over the internet 
these include laws relating to obscenity  indecency  libel and defamation 
we could be liable if content delivered by us violates these regulations 

table of contents l information security accountability regulation 
a number of bills are pending in congress that would require disclosure of security breaches involving personal information  and congress has considered bills that would require companies to engage independent third parties to audit the companies computer information security 
many states have enacted legislation requiring disclosure of security breaches involving personal information 
for example  california has enacted legislation requiring disclosure of security breaches involving personal information and medical information 
we may incur costs to comply with these security requirements 
because many of these laws are new and there is little guidance related to many of these laws  it is difficult to estimate the cost of our compliance with these laws 
if the company is required to make a public announcement regarding a breach of security or if one of the company s customers is required to make a public announcement in connection with a breach of security by the company  the company s business could be negatively impacted 
l sales and use tax 
through december   we collected sales  use or other taxes on taxable transactions in all states in which we have employees or have a significant level of sales activity 
while healthstream expects that this approach is appropriate  other states or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose tax collection obligations on companies like us that engage in online commerce 
if they do  these obligations could limit the growth of electronic commerce in general and limit our ability to profit from the sale of our services over the internet 
laws and regulations directly applicable to e commerce and internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
congress continues considering laws regarding internet taxation 
the dynamic nature of this regulatory environment increases the uncertainty regarding the marketplace impact of such regulation 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may increase our cost of conducting business or otherwise harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
regulation of education  training and other services for healthcare professionals occupational safety and health administration osha 
osha regulations require employers to provide training to employees to minimize the risk of injury from various potential workplace hazards 
employers in the healthcare industry are required to provide training with respect to various topics  including blood borne pathogens exposure control  laboratory safety and tuberculosis infection control 
osha regulations require employers to keep records of their employees completion of training with respect to these workplace hazards 
the joint commission 
the joint commission mandates that employers in the healthcare industry provide certain workplace safety and patient interaction training to employees 
training required by the joint commission may include programs on infection control  patient bill of rights  radiation safety and incident reporting 
healthcare organizations are required to provide and document training on these topics to receive the joint commission accreditation 
in addition  the joint commission imposes continuing education requirements on physicians that relate to each physician s specific staff appointments 
health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
hipaa regulations require certain organizations  including most healthcare providers and health plans  to adopt safeguards regarding the use and disclosure of health related information 
hipaa regulations also require organizations that maintain or transmit health information electronically in connection with certain transactions to provide reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy  integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information 
these healthcare organizations are required to establish  maintain and provide training with regard to their policies and procedures for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of individually identifiable healthcare information 
healthcare organizations are required to document training on these topics to support their compliance 
continuing nursing education cne 
state nurse practice laws are usually the source of authority for establishing the state board of nursing requirements 
the state board of nursing establishes the state s cne requirements for professional nurses 
cne credits are provided through accredited providers that have been approved by the american nurses credentialing center ancc commission on accreditation and or the state board of nursing 
cne requirements vary widely from state to state 
twenty nine states require registered nurses to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of cne credits in order to maintain their licenses 
in some states  the cne requirement only applies to re licensure of advance practice nurses  or additional cnes may be required of this category of nurses 
required cne ranges from to credits annually  with reporting generally on a bi annual basis 
board certifications eg  cnor certification of perioperative nursing also require cne credits  with certain percentages required in specific categories based on the certification type 
we are an accredited provider of cne by the ancc 
continuing medical education cme 
state licensing boards  professional organizations and employers require physicians to certify that they have accumulated a minimum number of continuing medical education hours to maintain their licenses 
generally  each state s medical practice laws authorize the state s board of medicine to establish and track cme requirements 
thirty five state medical licensing boards currently have cme requirements  as well as puerto rico  guam  and the us virgin islands 
the number of cme hours required by each state ranges from to hours per year 
other sources of cme requirements are state medical societies and practice specialty boards 
the failure to obtain the requisite amount and type of cme could result in non renewal of the physician s license to practice medicine and or membership in a medical or practice specialty society 
the american medical association s ama physician recognition award certificate pra is widely accepted as proof of participation in cme 
the ama classifies continuing medical education activities as either category  which includes formal cme activities  or category  which includes most informal activities 
sponsors want to designate cme activities for ama pra category because this has become the benchmark for quality in formally organized educational activities 
most agencies nationwide that require cme participation specify ama pra category credit 
only institutions and organizations accredited to provide cme can designate an activity for ama pra category the accreditation council 
table of contents for continuing medical education accme  is responsible for awarding accreditation status to state medical societies  medical schools  and other institutions and organizations that provide cme activities for a national audience of physicians 
only institutions and organizations are accredited 
the accme and state medical societies do not accredit or approve individual activities 
state medical societies  operating under the aegis of the accme  accredit institutions and organizations that provide cme activities primarily for physicians within the state or bordering states 
we are an accredited provider of cme by the accme 
consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems cahps 
cms has partnered with ahrq to develop a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients perspectives on hospital care 
the intent of the survey is to produce comparable data on the patients perspectives to allow consumer based comparisons between hospitals  align incentives to drive hospitals to improve their quality of care  and increase the transparency of hospital reporting 
according to the deficit reduction act of  hospitals must submit data for certain required quality measures which for inpatients includes the cahps hospital survey in order to receive the full market basket increase to their reimbursement payment rates from cms 
while hospital participation is voluntary  hospitals that fail to submit this survey data  will incur a reduction of two percentage points in the inpatient market basket update amount for the following federal fiscal year 
through both dmr and tjo  we have received certified vendor designation  and will continue to offer cahps hospital survey services 
allied disciplines 
various allied health professionals are required to obtain continuing education to maintain their licenses 
for example  emergency medical services personnel may be required to acquire up to continuing education hours per year  all or a portion of which can be fulfilled online 
these requirements vary by state and depend on the classification of the employee 
other continuing education 
we are also an accredited provider of continuing education and continuing pharmacy education by the association of surgical technologists  inc ast and the accreditation council for pharmacy education acpe  respectively 
regulation of educational sponsorship and support the office of inspector general oig issued compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers in april and issued compliance program guidance for the durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  and supply industry in july collectively  the guidelines 
these documents include guidelines related to continuing educational activities supported by pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
the guidelines already have and may continue to affect the type and extent of commercial support we receive for our continuing education activities 
the trade associations for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries phrma and advamed  respectively have also promulgated their own codes of ethics 
the ama has established its own code of ethics regarding gifts to physician from industry to provide standards of conduct for the medical profession 
the company follows the rules and guidelines provided by accme  ancc  and other continuing education accrediting bodies to ensure that its continuing education programming is free from commercial bias and consistent with the guidelines 
during  both the ancc and acpe adopted accme standards of commercial support which ensures independence in continuing medical education activities supported by grant funds from industry 
because of the adoption of the accme standards  a component of the standards limits the individuals that may deliver educational activities including clinical education activities and live events 
further  accme  ancc  and acpe are currently collaborating to develop a joint accreditation for the provider of continuing education for the healthcare team joint accreditation 
this will allow an organization that is seeking accreditation or reaccreditation status with all three accrediting bodies the ability to complete one self study application although each credentialing body conducts a separate accreditation process 
we believe this will also streamline the reaccreditation timeline for accredited organizations 
until this joint accreditation is completed  we will not be able to analyze the joint accreditation s impact on our accredited education activities 
the us food and drug administration and the federal trade commission current fda and ftc rules and enforcement actions and regulatory policies or those that the fda or the ftc may develop in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide existing or future applications or services to our end users or obtain the necessary corporate sponsorship to do so 
the fda and the ftc regulate the form  content and dissemination of labeling  advertising and promotional materials  including direct to consumer prescription drug and medical device advertising  prepared by  or for  pharmaceutical  biotechnology or medical device companies 
the ftc regulates over the counter drug advertising and  in some cases  medical device advertising 
generally  regulated companies must limit their advertising and promotional materials to discussions of the fda approved claims and  in limited circumstances  to a limited number of claims not approved by the fda 
therefore  any information that promotes the use of pharmaceutical or medical device products that is presented with our services is subject to the full array of the fda and ftc requirements and enforcement actions 
we believe that banner advertisements  sponsorship links and any educational programs that lack independent editorial control that we may present with our services could be subject to fda or ftc regulation 
while the fda and the ftc place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on the advertiser  if the fda or ftc finds that any regulated information presented with our services violates fda or ftc regulations  they may take regulatory action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information 
in  the fda announced it would develop a guidance document expressing a broad set of policies dealing with the promotion of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device products on the internet 
the fda has yet to issue that guidance document  and it is not clear when such document may be released 
the fda guidance document may reflect new regulatory policies that more tightly regulate the format and content of promotional information on the internet 

table of contents other government regulations the us securities and exchange commission the sec chartered the advisory committee on smaller public companies the committee on march  the charter directed the committee to assess the current regulatory system for smaller public companies  including the impact of the sarbanes oxley act of  and make recommendations for change 
during april  the committee issued its final report to the sec  which included a recommendation to establish a system of scaled securities regulations for smaller public companies 
during december  the sec issued new rules for smaller reporting companies  expanding the number of companies that qualify for its scaled disclosure requirements 
the company continues to monitor these regulations and rulings to ensure that we appropriately allocate our resources to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations 
currently  our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act is applicable for calendar year  but the sec has issued a rule proposal to delay the compliance date until for non accelerated filers  which would be applicable to us 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights to protect our proprietary rights  we rely generally on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and procedures with employees  consultants and other third parties  agreements with consultants  vendors and customers  and control access to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we own federal trademark and service mark registrations for the marks healthstream  hospital direct  or protocol  and quality check 
the courseware that we license to our customers is developed through a combination of license agreements with publishers or authors  assignments and work for hire arrangements with third parties  and development by employees 
we require publishers  authors and other third parties to represent and warrant that their content does not infringe on or misappropriate any third party intellectual property rights  that they have the right to provide their content and have obtained all third party consents necessary to do so 
our publishers  authors and other third parties also agree to indemnify us against certain liability we might sustain due to the content they provide 
if a third party asserts a claim that we have infringed their patents or other intellectual property  we may be required to redesign our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  we license technologies from third parties for incorporation into our services 
royalty and licensing agreements with these third parties may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
additionally  the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequate 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property 
competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products or services 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors could offer similar services  potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenues

table of contents item a 
risk factors we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this document are the principal material risks facing the company as of the date of this report 
in the future  we may become subject to additional risks that are not currently known to us 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and by any unknown risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the following risks or any unknown risks 
risks related to our business model 
we may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business and competitive position in the industry 
our business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence through sales to new customers  further penetration and additional sales to existing customers  introductions of new products and services  and maintaining strong relationships with our existing customers 
some of the risks that we may encounter in executing our growth strategy include l expenses  delays and difficulties of identifying and integrating new products or services into our existing organization  l inability to leverage our operational and financial systems sufficiently to support our growth  l inability to generate sufficient revenue from new products to offset investment costs  l inability to effectively identify  manage and exploit existing and emerging market opportunities  l inability to maintain our existing customer relationships  and l increased competition from new and existing competitors 
if any of these risks are realized  our business could suffer 
we may be unable to effectively identify  complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we are actively reviewing possible acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
we may not be able to identify  complete or integrate the operations of future acquisitions 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities  our existing shareholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and investments  our business prospects may be seriously harmed 
some of the risks that we may encounter in implementing our acquisition strategy include l expenses  delays or difficulties in identifying and integrating acquired companies into our organization  l inability to retain personnel associated with acquisitions  l diversion of management s attention from daily operations  and l inability to generate sufficient revenues  profits  and cash flows from acquisitions to offset our investment costs 
revenue recognition for certain products and services is dependent upon customer scheduling and acceptance 
as revenues from our subscription business continue to increase  a larger portion of our revenues will be predictable  however  quarterly performance may be more subject to fluctuations 
our healthstream research products and services are typically contracted by healthcare organizations for multi year terms  but the frequency and timing of survey cycles can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
also  other project based products  such as live events and professional services  are subject to the customers involvement in the provision of the product 
the magnitude of these project based service contracts may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year  and thus may effect our ability to accurately predict quarterly and annual financial performance 

table of contents our sales cycle is lengthy and can vary widely 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer and the first purchase of our solution by the customer typically ranges from three to nine months  and in some cases has extended much further 
the range in the sales cycle can be impacted by factors including an increasing trend towards a more formal requests for proposals rfp s process and more competition within our industry  as well as formal budget timelines which impact timing of purchases by target customers 
as a result of these factors  we have only limited ability to forecast the timing and type of initial sales 
this  in turn  makes it more difficult to predict quarterly and annual financial performance 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources 
several of our competitors and many potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do 
we encounter direct competition from both large and small e learning companies and other companies focused on training and continuing education in the healthcare industry 
we also face competition from larger survey and research companies 
given the profile and growth of the healthcare industry and the growing need for education  training  research  and information  it is likely that additional competitors will emerge 
we believe we maintain a competitive advantage against our competitors with the comprehensive array of products and services we offer 
if our competitors were to offer a complete e learning solution to the healthcare industry  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
these companies may be able to respond more quickly than we are to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
further  most of our customer agreements are for terms ranging from one to three years  with no obligation to renew 
the short terms of these agreements enable customers to shift to one of our competitors 
growth in courseware subscription revenues depends  in part  on our obtaining proper distribution rights from our content partners 
most of our agreements with content providers are for initial terms of two to three years 
the content partners may choose not to renew their agreements with us or may terminate the agreements early if we do not fulfill our contractual obligations 
if a significant number of our content providers terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us on acceptable terms  it could result in a reduction in the number of courses we are able to distribute  causing decreased revenues 
most of our agreements with our content partners are also non exclusive  and our competitors also offer  or could offer  training and continuing education content that is similar to or the same as ours 
if publishers and authors  including our current content partners  offer information to users or our competitors on more favorable terms than those offered to us or increase our license fees  our competitive position and our profit margins and prospects could be harmed 
in addition  the failure by our content partners to deliver high quality content and to revise their content in response to user demand and evolving healthcare advances and trends could result in customer dissatisfaction and inhibit our ability to attract and retain subscribers of our courseware offerings 
we may not be able to develop enhancements to our existing products and services or achieve widespread acceptance of new features or keep pace with technological developments 
our revenue growth is expected to be generated through sales to new customers as well as increasing sales of additional courseware subscriptions and other products and services to existing customers 
our identification of additional features  content  products and services may not result in timely development of complementary products 
in addition  the success of certain new products and services may be dependent on continued growth in our base of internet based customers or adoption of new methodology by new customers 
because healthcare training continues to change and evolve  we may be unable to accurately predict and develop features  content and other products to address these needs of the healthcare industry 
if new products  features  or content are not accepted by new or existing customers  we may not be able to recover the cost of this development and our business will be harmed 
continued growth of our internet based customer population is dependent on our ability to continue to provide relevant products and services in a timely manner 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to continue providing our products and services as well as enhancing our courseware  product and service offerings that address the needs of healthcare organizations 
our product and service offerings include third party technology  the loss of which could materially harm our business 
errors in third party software or our inability to license this software in the future could increase our costs and decrease our revenues 
we use some licensed third party technology components in our products 
future licenses to this technology may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of or inability to obtain or maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in the introduction of new products or could force us to discontinue offering portions of our learning management solutions until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party technology or content that we incorporate  and we may incur additional costs to repair or replace the defective software 
it may be difficult for us to correct any errors in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our revenue could decrease and our costs could increase in the event of any errors in this technology 
furthermore  we may become subject to legal claims related to licensed technology based on product liability  infringement of intellectual property or other legal theories 

table of contents financial risks a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
a termination of our agreements with our significant customers or a failure of these customers to renew their contracts on favorable terms  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our business is subject to renewal each year 
therefore  renewals have a significant impact on our revenue and operating results 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of our net revenues were derived from our internet based subscription products 
our internet based hlc customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products or services after the expiration of the initial subscription period  and in fact  some customers have elected not to renew their subscription 
in addition  our customers may renew at a lower pricing or activity level 
during the year ended december   we renewed of the annual hlc contract value up for renewal and of the subscribers which were up for renewal 
because a significant portion of our customer contracts have only renewed one time  we do not have sufficient historical data to accurately predict future customer renewal rates 
our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including their dissatisfaction with our service 
if we are unable to renew a substantial portion of the contracts that are up for renewal or maintain our pricing  our revenues could be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position 
contracts for our survey and research services typically range from one to three years in length  and customers are not obligated to renew their contract with us after their contract expires 
if our customers do not renew their arrangements for our services  or if their activity levels decline  our revenue may decline and our business will suffer 
the timing of our revenue recognition from sales activity is dependent upon achievement of certain events or performance milestones  and our inability to accurately predict them will impact our operating results 
our ability to recognize revenues is dependent upon several factors including the transfer of customer specific information such as unique subscriber ids  which are required for us to implement customers on our internet based learning platform 
accordingly  if customers do not provide us with the specified information in a timely manner  our ability to recognize revenues will be delayed  which could adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  completion and acceptance by our customers of developed content and courseware must be achieved  survey responses must be received  and utilization of courseware is required in connection with subscription internet based learning products for us to recognize revenues 
as we noted above  while we have been successful in achieving growth in our subscription based revenues  our project based revenues are likely to be subject to significant fluctuations 
because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our products and services over the term of the subscription period  downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results 
we recognize approximately of our revenue from customers monthly over the terms of their subscription agreements  which have initial contract terms ranging from one to three years  although terms can range from less than one to up to five years 
as a result  much of the revenue we report in each quarter is related to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters 
consequently  a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues 
accordingly  the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products and services may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods 
additionally  our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period  as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term 
we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives unless we obtain additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
our current cash reserves  revolving credit facility  and results of operations are expected to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to l develop new  or enhance existing  services or products  l respond to competitive pressures  l finance working capital requirements  or l acquire complementary businesses  technology  content or products 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and related interest receivable 
we also have up to million of availability under a revolving credit facility  subject to certain covenants 
we expect to incur up to 
table of contents million of capital expenditures  software feature enhancements and content purchases during to support our business 
in september we authorized a stock repurchase plan  with approval to acquire up to million of our common stock 
we continue to actively review possible business acquisitions that would complement our products and services 
we may not have adequate cash and investments or availability under our revolving credit facility to consummate one or more acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that if we need additional financing that it will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of available opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be reduced 
we have significant goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet that may be subject to impairment losses that would reduce our reported assets and earnings 
as of december   our balance sheet included goodwill of million and identifiable intangible assets of million 
economic  legal  regulatory  competitive  contractual  and other factors may affect the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in the future 
if any of these factors impair the value of these assets  accounting rules require us to reduce their carrying value and recognize an impairment charge  which would reduce our reported assets and earnings in the period an impairment is recognized 
our stock price is likely to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  many of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in market valuations of other online service companies  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  general political and economic conditions  such as a recession or war or terrorist attacks or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  and other risk factors described in this annual report on form k 
moreover  our stock is thinly traded  and we have a relatively small public float 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the market prices for stocks of many internet related and technology companies have historically experienced significant price fluctuations that in some cases appear to bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
risks related to sales  marketing and competition we continue to refine our pricing and our products and services and cannot predict whether the ongoing changes will be accepted 
over the past few years we have implemented several changes and continue to make changes in our pricing and our product and service offerings to increase revenue and to meet the needs of our customers 
we cannot predict whether our current pricing and products and services  or any ongoing refinements we make will be accepted by our existing customer base or by prospective customers 
if our customers and potential customers decide not to accept our current or future pricing or product and service offerings  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to operations difficulties in the adoption of the new version of our internet based hlc platform could harm our business 
we released a new version of our internet based hlc platform during the fourth quarter of and as of february  had transitioned our entire subscriber base to this platform 
during the transition process we experienced issues with the new platform such as defects in the software  data migration errors  and customer orientation to certain changed or new features 
in response  we increased our resources to better identify  manage  and respond to issues raised by our customers  and as a result  we incurred approximately million of incremental expenses to address and remediate these issues during if customers are not satisfied with the new version of our internet based hlc platform  they may not renew their contract with us  we may incur additional expenses to address and resolve their concerns with the product service  and we may need to provide service credits in excess of our accrual for service interruptions 
we may be unable to adequately develop our systems  processes and support in a manner that will enable us to meet the demand for our services 
we have provided our online products and services since and continue to develop our ability to provide our courseware and learning management systems on both a subscription and transactional basis over the internet 
our future success will depend on our ability to effectively develop the infrastructure  including additional hardware and software  and implement the services  including customer support  necessary to meet the demand for our services 
our inability from time to time to successfully develop the necessary systems and implement the necessary services on a timely basis has resulted in our customers experiencing some delays or interruptions in their service 
such delays or interruptions may cause customers to become dissatisfied with our service and move to competing providers of 
table of contents traditional and online training and education services 
if this happens  our revenues could be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose members of  or fail to integrate  our management team 
our future performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our management team and our ability to retain and motivate them 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or senior managers could harm our business  as we may not be able to find suitable replacements 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  other than our chief executive officer  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we may not be able to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees and  as a result  we may not be able to grow as we expect or maintain the quality of our services 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  motivate  and retain other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  customer support  and interviewing center personnel who conduct phone surveys 
competition for certain personnel is intense  especially for developers  web designers and sales personnel  and we may be unable to successfully attract sufficiently qualified personnel 
we have experienced difficulty in the past hiring qualified personnel in a timely manner for these positions 
the pool of qualified technical personnel  in particular  is limited in nashville  tennessee  which is where our headquarters are located 
our interviewing center is located in laurel  maryland  and we may experience difficulty in maintaining and recruiting qualified individuals to perform these services 
we will also need to maintain the size of our staff to support our anticipated growth  without compromising the quality of our offerings or customer service 
our inability to locate  hire  integrate and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers may reduce the quality of our services 
we must continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure  both hardware and software  to effectively meet demand for our services 
we must continue to obtain reasonably priced  commercially available hardware and continue to enhance software to accommodate the increased use of our platform and increased courseware in our library 
in order to make timely decisions about hardware and software enhancements  we must be able to accurately forecast the growth in demand for our services 
this growth in demand for our services is difficult to forecast and the potential audience for our services is large 
if we are unable to increase the data storage and processing capacity of our systems at least as fast as the growth in demand  our customers may encounter delays or disruptions in their service 
unscheduled downtime could harm our business and also could discourage current and potential customers and reduce future revenues 
our network infrastructure and computer systems and software may fail 
an unexpected event like a telecommunications failure  fire  earthquake  or other catastrophic loss at our internet service providers facilities or at our on site data facility could cause the loss of critical data and prevent us from offering our products and services 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
in addition  we rely on third parties to securely store our archived data  house our web server and network systems and connect us to the internet 
while our service providers have planned for certain contingencies  the failure by any of these third parties to provide these services satisfactorily and our inability to find suitable replacements would impair our ability to access archives and operate our systems and software 
we may lose users and lose revenues if our security measures fail 
if the security measures that we use to protect personal information are ineffective  we may lose users of our services  which could reduce our revenues 
we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties 
with this technology  we perform real time credit card authorization and verification  as well as the encryption of other selected secure customer data 
we cannot predict whether these security measures could be circumvented by new technological developments 
in addition  our software  databases and servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic attacks and similar disruptions 
we may need to spend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we cannot assure that we can prevent all security breaches 
risks related to government regulation  content and intellectual property government regulation may require us to change the way we do business 
the laws and regulations that govern our business change rapidly 
the united states government and the governments of states and foreign countries have attempted to regulate activities on the internet 
evolving areas of law that are relevant to our business include privacy law  proposed encryption laws  content regulation  information security accountability regulation  and sales and use tax laws and regulations 
because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment  we cannot predict how these laws and regulations might affect our business 
these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing the internet 
these laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change how we do business 
in addition  certain laws mandate that our customers contractually require us to protect the privacy and security of certain personal and health related information 
if we fail to abide by these required contractual provisions  our customers may terminate their contracts with us 
see business government regulation of the internet and the healthcare industry for a more complete discussion of these laws and regulations 

table of contents our inability to maintain cms certification to conduct hcahps surveys may adversely affect our business 
our survey product offerings include providing hcahps survey services to assist customers in their compliance with cms regulations 
we are currently designated as a cms certified vendor to offer hcahps survey data collection services 
if we are unable to maintain this certification  we would not be able to offer our customers this survey instrument and our business may suffer 
any reduction or change in the regulation of continuing education and training in the healthcare industry may adversely affect our business 
our business model is dependent in part on required training and continuing education for healthcare professionals and other healthcare workers resulting from regulations of state and federal agencies  state licensing boards and professional organizations 
any change in these regulations that reduce the requirements for continuing education and training for the healthcare industry could harm our business 
in addition  a portion of our business with pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and hospitals is predicated on our ability to maintain accreditation status with organizations such as the accme  ancc  ast  and acpe 
the failure to maintain status as an accredited provider could have a detrimental effect on our business 
government regulations may reduce our business activity with pharmaceutical and medical device customers 
in april  the oig of the department of health and human services hhs issued oig compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in july  the oig issued compliance program guidance for the durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics and supply industry 
these guidelines collectively identify three areas of risks for pharmaceutical and medical device companies and recommend certain best practices to be included in a compliance plan designed to avoid the risk of federal healthcare program abuse 
the guidance highlighted a number of arrangements that have the potential to trigger fraud and abuse violations  including educational grants 
in april the us senate finance committee released a report critical of practices related to the funding of educational programs by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
congress is considering legislation that would require manufacturers of drugs  devices  and medical supplies to report to hhs  anything of value  including educational programs  given by such manufacturers to physicians 
this legislation would require that hhs make such information publicly available on the internet 
the company follows the rules and guidelines provided by the accme  ancc and other continuing education accrediting bodies to ensure that its continuing education programming is free from commercial bias and consistent with the oig guidance 
the majority of the company s accredited continuing education programming is funded by educational grants from our pharmaceutical and medical device customers 
there is no assurance that our pharmaceutical and medical device customers will continue to provide educational grants consistent with past practices 
in fact  we have experienced a reduction in live event activities we provide which are supported by pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
to the extent that our customers continue to curtail or restructure their business practices  our business with this customer base may suffer 
we may be liable to third parties for content that is available from our online library 
we may be liable to third parties for the content in our online library if the text  graphics  software or other content in our library violates copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  our content partners violate their contractual obligations to others by providing content to our library  or the content does not conform to accepted standards of care in the healthcare profession 
we attempt to minimize these types of liabilities by requiring representations and warranties relating to our content partners ownership of the rights to distribute as well as the accuracy of their content 
we also take necessary measures to review this content ourselves 
although our agreements with our content partners contain provisions providing for indemnification by the content providers in the event of inaccurate content  our content partners may not have the financial resources to meet this obligation 
alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs  and diverting management s attention away from our business 
see business intellectual property and other proprietary rights for a more complete discussion of the potential effects of this liability on our business 
protection of certain intellectual property may be difficult and costly 
despite protection of certain proprietary rights  a third party could  without authorization  copy or otherwise misappropriate our content  information from our databases  or other intellectual property 
our agreements with employees  consultants and others who participate in development activities could be breached and result in our trade secrets becoming known or independently developed by competitors 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in those jurisdictions 
we currently own several trademarks and domain names 
the current system for registering  allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and proposed regulatory reform 
additionally  legislative proposals have been made by the federal government that would afford broad protection to owners of databases of information  such as stock quotes 
this protection of databases already exists in the european union 
there has been substantial litigation in the computer and online industries regarding intellectual property assets  particularly patents 
third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to current and future products  trademarks or other proprietary rights  and we may counterclaim against such third parties in such actions 
any such claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  cause product release delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  and we may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
our business could be harmed if unauthorized parties infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property  proprietary systems  content  services or other information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through copyright  trademarks and other controls may not be adequate 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the patents  intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties  which could be time consuming and costly 
intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us  especially as the number of our competitors grows 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
in addition  if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and develop comparable non infringing intellectual property  to obtain a license  or to cease providing the content or services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing intellectual property or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all

we had approximately  fully implemented subscribers on our internet based hlc platform at december   representing over  hospitals in the united states 
during  we renewed approximately  hlc subscribers  representing a renewal rate for the subscribers up for renewal  and a renewal rate based on the annual contract value up for renewal 
as of december  our cash and investment balances approximated million and we maintained full availability under our million revolving credit facility 
during  we transitioned approximately of our customer base to a new and enhanced version of our internet based hlc 
the last five percent of our subscribers transitioned to the new platform in february  at their own requests 
we have invested a significant amount of capital and internal resources to develop and deploy this new version of our flagship product  including approximately million of incremental costs during to support our customer s transition to this product 
we expect this new version of the hlc will be the cornerstone to our future growth and will enable us to more efficiently integrate the delivery of new product offerings to healthcare professionals who subscribe to our learning solutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning products and courseware subscriptions based on a per person subscription basis  and in some cases on a per license basis 
our fees are based on the size of the facilities or organizations employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
revenues from survey and research services are recognized when survey results are delivered to customers via either internet based reporting throughout the survey period or by providing final survey results once all services are complete 
revenues for survey and reporting services  which are provided through the use of internet based reporting methodologies  are recognized using the proportional performance method  consistent with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  reflecting recognition throughout the service period which corresponds with the survey cycle and reporting access by the customer  which typically ranges from one to five months 
revenues for survey and reporting services  which include delivery of survey results to the customer when all services are completed  are recognized upon completion 
all other revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered to the customer 
revenues for these services can be subject to seasonal factors based on customers requirements that can impact the timing  frequency  and volume of survey cycles 
revenues from professional services include content maintenance  consulting  and implementation services 
fees are based on the time and efforts involved  and revenue is recognized upon completion of performance milestones using the proportional performance method 
we offer training services for clients to facilitate integration of our internet based products 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
basic online training is generally included in the initial contract  however  incremental training revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 
revenues from installed learning management products are associated with ongoing maintenance and technical support services  typically based on a percentage of the original contract amount and are recognized as revenue over the term of the service period  generally one year 

table of contents we recognize revenue from live event development services using a proportional performance method based on completion of performance milestones 
revenues from content maintenance and development services are recognized using a percentage of completion method based on labor hours  which correspond to the completion of performance milestones and deliverables 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of meeting and conference dates for such companies 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and our survey and research services through healthcare organizations and to a lesser extent  through pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
the percentage of total revenues from our internet based subscription products has declined compared to historical periods  whereas revenues from our survey and research services are not internet based 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the fees we charge for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 
product development costs we account for web site development costs in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for web site development costs and for capitalized software feature enhancements in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which provide guidance on when to capitalize versus expense costs incurred to develop internal use software or web sites 
we capitalize costs incurred during the development phase for such projects when such costs are material 
maintenance and operating costs are expensed as incurred 
product development costs primarily include our costs to initially develop and maintain software feature enhancements and content for our internet based learning product 
once planning is completed and development begins  we capitalize payments to third parties associated with the cost of software feature enhancement development or content where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows from such software feature enhancements or content are expected to exceed the cost of the related asset 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  related to development of content by third parties 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption prepaid development fees and other assets 
during and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  for development of software feature enhancements by third parties 
such amounts are included in the accompanying balance sheets under the caption capitalized software feature enhancements 
a significant portion of these capitalized costs were associated with the development of the new version of our internet based hlc platform and a new competency assessment product 
we amortize content and software feature enhancements over their expected life  which is generally one to four years 
capitalized content and software feature enhancements are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our impairment review policy 
in connection with product development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of the development period for new products  as well as the expected useful life of costs associated with new products  software feature enhancements and content 
once capitalized  software feature enhancements and content development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
product development costs also include our systems team  which manages our efforts associated with product development and maintenance  database management  quality assurance and security 
this team is responsible for new internal product development  integration of external new products  and continued enhancements and regularly scheduled maintenance to our learning and research platform products 
this team was also responsible for the migration of customers to the new version of our internet based hlc platform 
personnel who are responsible for our overall product portfolio as well as prioritization of new product development are also included in product development costs 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we measure for impairment at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
our discounted cash flow model contains significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future and could result in an impairment 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using both a specific and non specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific and non specific identification approach 
accrual for service interruptions we provide customers with a fully hosted learning management application  and our internet based learning products are subject to periodic downtime 
due to the complexity of our hosted applications  variability in customer utilization patterns  changes in technology  and potential software defects  our hosted applications could experience periodic downtime 
we maintain an accrual which is intended to provide for customer concessions in the event customers experience inconveniences or operation disruption resulting from downtime of our applications 
our accrual for service interruptions totaled approximately  as of december  certain of our customers who have transitioned to our new platform have experienced difficulties in accessing or using certain features of our system  and we expect to provide these customers with product and service credits 
stock based compensation we began recognizing compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options on january  measurement of such compensation expense requires significant estimation and assumptions  however we believe that the black scholes option pricing model we use for calculating the fair value of our stock based compensation plans provides a reasonable measurement methodology using a framework that is widely adopted 
we have a stock option plan and an employee stock purchase plan which qualify as stock based compensation plans 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded  and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively
