item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements and aps financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
customer growth in aps service territory is above the national average and remains an important driver of our revenues and earnings 
our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates 
aps retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
aps capital expenditure requirements  which are discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  are substantial because of customer growth in aps service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget  highlighting aps need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures 
on june   the acc issued an order in a general rate case granting aps retail base rate increases 
the acc rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in note suncor  our real estate development subsidiary  has been an important source of earnings in recent years  although suncor s earnings in and expected earnings in reflect a slowdown in the western united states real estate markets 
see discussion below in pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook subsidiaries 
our subsidiary  apses  provides energy related products and services and competitive commodity related energy services to commercial and industrial retail customers in the western united states 
recently  apses has de emphasized its commodity related energy services 
el dorado  our investment subsidiary  owns minority interests in several energy related investments and arizona community based ventures

income from continuing operations decreased million in the year to year comparison and is reflected in the segments as follows 
table of contents regulated electricity segment income from continuing operations increased approximately million primarily due to higher retail sales related to customer growth  the effects of weather on retail sales  and impacts of the retail rate increase 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense primarily due to increased generation costs including increased maintenance and overhauls and the palo verde performance improvement plan  customer service and other costs  higher depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased plant balances  lower other income  net of expense  primarily due to miscellaneous asset sales in the prior year and lower interest income as a result of lower investment balances  and a regulatory disallowance 
in addition  higher fuel and purchased power costs related to commodity price increases were substantially offset by deferral of such costs in accordance with the psa

table of contents debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios 
certain of aps bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test 
pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements 
for both pinnacle west and aps  these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west and for aps 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for aps 
the interest coverage was approximately times under aps bank financing agreements as of december  failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt 
see further discussion of cross default provisions below 
neither pinnacle west s nor aps financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade 
however  our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 
all of pinnacle west s loan agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements 
all of aps bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements

off balance sheet arrangements in  aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and  accordingly  do not consolidate them see note 
aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants  and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value 
if such an event had occurred as of december   aps would have been required to assume approximately million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately million

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

table of contents regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa 
aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
we had million  including million related to the psa  of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  also included in the balance of regulatory assets at december  is a regulatory asset of million in accordance with sfas no 
for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc  this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 
in addition  we had million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december   which primarily are related to removal costs 
see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

b this assumes a change in the initial and ultimate health care cost trend rate 
see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we 
table of contents use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable 
in some cases  we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value 
the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 
other accounting matters in september  the fasb issued sfas no

in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts fsp fin 
under fsp fin  a reporting entity is permitted to offset the fair value amounts recognized for cash collateral paid or cash collateral received against the fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement 
this new guidance is effective for us on january   with early application permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impacts of fsp fin on our balance sheet 
we do not expect the guidance to have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
see note for a discussion of fin on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted january  pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook factors affecting operating revenues  fuel and purchased power costs general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of 
table of contents our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer growth  variations in weather from period to period  customer mix  average usage per customer  electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of psa deferrals 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps retail customers through the psa 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including demand and prices 
competitive retail sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by apses in certain western states that have opened to competition 
rate proceedings our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates 
aps retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
aps capital expenditure requirements  which are discussed above under liquidity and capital resources  are substantial because of customer growth in aps service territory and inflationary impacts on the capital budget  highlighting aps need for the timely recovery through rates of these and other expenditures 
on june   the acc issued an order in a general rate case granting aps retail base rate increases 
the acc rate case decision and other retail and wholesale rate matters are discussed in note fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  our hedging program for managing such costs and  since april   psa deferrals and the amortization thereof 
see psa modifications and deferrals in note for information regarding the psa  including the deferrals 
aps recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and  if necessary  periodic psa adjustments 
customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers and sales to them 
customer growth in aps service territory was during customer growth averaged a year for the three years through  and we currently expect customer growth to decline  averaging about to per year for through due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in arizona 
for the three years through  aps actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours grew at an average annual rate of  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  such retail sales growth averaged a year 
we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow to on average per year  during through  excluding the effects of weather variations 
we currently expect our retail sales growth in to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases see note actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 

table of contents weather in forecasting retail sales growth  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
wholesale market our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing aps risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand 
our marketing and trading activities include  subject to specified parameters  marketing  hedging and trading in electricity  fuels and emission allowances and credits 
see rate requests for transmission and ancillary services in note for information regarding aps recent filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 
other factors affecting financial results operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant operations  maintenance of utility plant including generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and changes in depreciation and amortization rates 
see capital expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 
property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessment ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of the assessed value for  of assessed value for and for we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation  transmission and distribution facilities and as we improve our existing facilities 
see capital expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  and internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in and  there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional electric service providers will re enter aps service territory 
subsidiaries suncor s net income was million in  million in and million in see note for further discussion

this estimate reflects continuation of the slowdown in the western united states real estate markets
