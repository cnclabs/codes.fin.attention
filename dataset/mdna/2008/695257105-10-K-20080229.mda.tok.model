item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
basis of presentation financial statements for all periods presented in this report are prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
all per share information is presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial information to conform to current year presentation 
we acquired of the stock of prairie packaging  inc prairie on june  the results of prairie s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of that date 
in january  we purchased an additional interest in a folding carton operation in dongguan  china 
this brought our interest to  and since then we have included the joint venture in our consolidated financial statements 
on october   we completed the sale of most of our protective and flexible packaging businesses to pregis corporation 
these businesses historically were included in our protective and flexible packaging segment 
in conjunction with the sale of these entities  we reviewed our reporting segments in concert with requirements of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
as a result  we elected to include the retained portions of the protective and flexible packaging businesses in our foodservice food packaging segment 
we have three reporting segments consumer products manufactures disposable plastic  foam  molded fiber  pressed paperboard  and aluminum packaging products  and sells them to customers such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  and discount chains 
products include waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
we sell many of our consumer products under well known trademarks  such as hefty 
foodservice food packaging manufactures foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging products  and sells them to customers in the food distribution channel  who prepare and process food for consumption 
customers include foodservice distributors  restaurants  and other institutional foodservice outlets  food processors  and grocery chains 
other relates to corporate and administrative service operations and retiree benefit income and expense 
the accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those for pactiv as a whole 
where discrete financial information is not available by segment  reasonable allocations of expenses and assets liabilities are used 
executive overview business our primary business involves the manufacture and sale of consumer and specialty packaging products for the consumer and foodservice food packaging markets 
we operate manufacturing facilities in countries 
consumer products include plastic  aluminum  and paper based products  such as waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
these products are sold under such well known brand names as hefty  baggies  hefty onezip  hefty cinch sak  hefty the gripper  hefty zoo pals  kordite  and ez foil tm 
foodservice and food packaging products include foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging for customers in the food distribution channel 
customers include wholesalers  supermarkets  restaurants  and packer processors  who prepare and process food for consumption 
we sell our products to a wide array of customers worldwide 
customers include grocery stores  mass merchandisers  discount chains  restaurants  distributors  and fabricators 
costs incurred in connection with the 
table of contents manufacture and sale of these products are recorded in either cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expenses 
greater than of our sales come from products made from different types of plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene  and  to a lesser extent  polypropylene and amorphous polyethylene terephthalate 
we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
in addition  in conjunction with our spin off from tenneco inc tenneco in  we became the sponsor of retirement plans covering participating employees of certain former subsidiaries and affiliates of tenneco 
with the exception of pension service costs associated with our production operations  we record pension income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
however  when assessing our performance and returns  we typically exclude the effect of pension income and pension assets and liabilities 
significant trends  opportunities  and challenges several opportunities and challenges may influence our continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of raw material cost volatility the ability to increase selling prices the continued effectiveness of our productivity and procurement initiatives longer term risks include potential changes in consumer demand or governmental regulations possible supplier and customer consolidations potential increases in foreign based competition possible growth in market share of unbranded products we expect to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs leveraging our existing products into new distribution channels introducing innovative new products making strategic acquisitions the primary raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
average industry prices for polystyrene and polyethylene as published by chemical market associates  inc are depicted in the following graphs 
polystyrene cents lb 
polyethylene cents lb 
line graph line graph oil prices are currently near their historic highs  and we expect that resin costs will continue to be a source of volatility for us 
over time  we have been able to raise selling prices in many areas of our business to mitigate the effect of resin cost increases 
we continue to closely monitor the resin marketplace and will respond quickly to any raw material cost increases 
our business is sensitive to other energy related cost movements  particularly those that affect transportation and utility costs 
historically  we have been able to mitigate the effect of higher energy related costs with 
table of contents productivity improvements and other cost reductions 
however  if energy related costs increase significantly in the future  we may not be able to fully offset such increases with productivity gains 
in  we began to introduce lean principles and tools in many of our operating facilities 
we are expanding the use of lean principles to help us accelerate productivity improvements by reducing inventory and scrap levels  providing rapid stock replenishment  shortening scheduling cycles  improving our one stop shopping service  eliminating nonvalue added activities  and streamlining processes 
we expect our ability to use these tools throughout the organization will positively affect our operating results over the next several years 
we expect that the integration of the prairie and pactiv businesses will result in synergies of million during the first full year  and will give rise to improved operating results over the next several years 
the company commenced the implementation of a cost reduction program in the first quarter of this program will include the consolidation of two small facilities  asset rationalizations  and headcount reductions 
we will take a related charge of approximately million after tax earnings per share reduction of  the majority of which will occur in the first quarter 
approximately million of the charge will be noncash 
the program is expected to increase after tax earnings by million  or per share  in  and by million  or per share  on an annualized basis

table of contents capital commitments commitments for authorized capital expenditures totaled approximately million at december  it is anticipated that the majority of these expenditures will be funded over the next months from existing cash and short term investments and internally generated cash 
contractual obligations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under long term contracts 
our long term contractual obligations at december   were as follows due in less than more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes fixed rate debentures  plus related interest payment obligations  based on rates in effect at december  includes open capital commitments  amounts related to the purchase of minimum quantities of raw materials at current market prices under supply agreements and other long term vendor agreements with specific payment provisions and early termination penalties 
includes undiscounted workers compensation obligations  and undiscounted and unfunded postretirement medical and supplemental pension funding requirements 
liquidity and off balance sheet financing we use various sources of funding to manage liquidity 
sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and a year revolving credit facility of million  under which million was outstanding at december  we were in full compliance with the financial and other covenants of our revolving credit agreement at the end of the period 
we also use an asset securitization facility as a form of off balance sheet financing 
at december   million was securitized under this facility 
no amounts were securitized as of december  on april   we repaid million of notes due on that date using proceeds from our asset securitization facility million and cash on hand 
we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
funding of the qualified us pension plan is currently determined by requirements of the employee retirement income security act  under which we were not required to make contributions to the plan in on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
the ppa  which is effective for plan years beginning after december   significantly alters current funding requirements 
based on our current assumptions and requirements of the ppa  we do not anticipate that after tax contributions to the plan will be significant for the foreseeable future 
we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash reserves  and the ability to obtain cash under our credit facility and asset securitization program will be sufficient to meet current and future liquidity and capital requirements

sfas no 
also requires that additional disclosures be provided in the notes to the financial statements regarding the impact on net periodic benefit costs of delaying the recognition of gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
these changes are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in addition  effective for fiscal years ending after december   sfas no 
precludes companies from using other than their fiscal year end date to measure plan assets and obligations 
we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on december  we recorded a charge to other comprehensive income of million upon adoption 
critical accounting policies following are our accounting policies that involve the exercise of considerable judgment and the use of estimates 
these have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to customers  which generally occurs as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  we estimate the amount of deductions from sales that are likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs 
these include volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon offerings 
estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
in addition  we pay slotting fees and participate in cooperative advertising programs 
our accounting policy for all these programs is to deduct the expenses from revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories and at december   and  respectively is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
products which are made and sold in the us and use polystyrene  polyethylene  amorphous polypropylene terephthalate  or paper as their principal raw material utilize the lifo method of inventory accounting 
similar products which are produced and sold outside of the us use the first in  first out fifo or the average cost method of inventory accounting because the lifo valuation method is not permitted in those countries in which we operate 
worldwide  we use the fifo accounting method for production supplies and products made from aluminum and polypropylene 
given the volatility of the cost of our raw materials primarily plastic resins  we prefer the lifo valuation method  because it reflects the current cost of inventories in cost of sales 
if we had first valued all inventories using the fifo accounting method as of january   net income would have been million  or per share  higher in  million  or per share  higher in  and million  or per share  lower in we periodically review inventory balances to identify slow moving and or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 

table of contents pension plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
see changes in accounting principles on page for additional information 
total pretax pension plan income was million in  million in  and million in  and represented the net pension income  which is recorded as an offset to sg a expenses  and our production operations pension service costs  which are recorded in cost of sales 
we estimate that our noncash pretax pension income will decrease to million in projections of pension income are based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  assumptions pertaining to the amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions related to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing our assumption regarding the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we estimate future returns on various classes of assets  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since its inception in  our us qualified pension plan s annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plan has invested approximately of its assets in equity securities and in fixed income investments 
after considering all of these factors  we concluded that the use of a rate of return on assets assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return on assets assumption would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption for our us pension plan is based on the composite yield of a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plan s future benefit obligations 
in this connection  the discount rate assumption for our us plan at our september measurement date was for and for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
we use a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over a year period 
resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach outlined in sfas no

table of contents cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements included in this annual report on form k  including statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and in the notes to the financial statements  are forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact  including statements regarding prospects and future results  are forward looking 
these forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of terms and phrases such as will  believe  anticipate  may  might  could  expect  estimated  projects  intends  foreseeable future  and similar terms and phrases 
these forward looking statements are not based on historical facts  but rather on our current expectations or projections about future events 
accordingly  these forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
while we believe that the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable and make the statements in good faith  actual results almost always vary from expected results  and differences could be material 
in the risk factors section item a  we have attempted to list some of the factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these factors include the following changes in consumer demand and selling prices for our products  including new products that our competitors or we may introduce that could impact sales and margins 
material substitutions and changes in costs of raw materials  including plastic resins  labor  utilities  or transportation that could impact our expenses and margins 
changes in laws or governmental actions  including changes in regulations such as those relating to air emissions or plastics generally 
the availability or cost of capital could impact growth or acquisition opportunities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks we may enter into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
commodity derivatives during the fourth quarter of  we entered into natural gas purchase agreements with third parties  hedging a portion of the first quarter purchases of natural gas used in the production process at certain of our plants 
these purchase agreements are marked to market  with the resulting gains or losses recognized in earnings when hedged transactions are recorded 
the mark to market adjustments at december  were immaterial 
interest rates at december   we had public debt securities of billion outstanding  with fixed interest rates and maturities ranging from to years 
should we decide to redeem these securities prior to their stated maturity  we would incur costs based on the fair value of the securities at that time 
in addition  we have a variable interest rate line of credit  against which we borrowed million at december  the fair value of the debt at that date was equal to the outstanding balance 
as a part of the acquisition of prairie packaging inc prairie  we assumed prairie s liability for amounts million borrowed from the illinois development finance authority idfa  which were funded by industrial development revenue bonds issued by the idfa 
the debt matures on december   and bears interest at varying rates as of december  not to exceed per annum 
the following table provides information about pactiv s financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risks 
maturities in millions  except percentages thereafter total fixed rate debt average interest rate fair value floating rate debt average interest rate fair value prior to our spin off from tenneco inc  we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to interest rate movements 
we settled this swap in november  incurring a million loss  which is being recognized as additional interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
in april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk related to million of the debt expected to be issued in connection with the acquisition of prairie 
we entered into these swap agreements to moderate the risk of interest rate changes during the period from the date the agreement to acquire prairie was signed to the date the notes used to finance the acquisition were issued 
the swap agreements were terminated on june   resulting in a gain of million 
this gain is being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the average life of the underlying debt 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the risk of interest rate volatility on million of amounts due under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility 
this agreement will terminate in december  and its fair value was a liability of million at december
