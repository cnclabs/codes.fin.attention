item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage  food and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world 
we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food companies and producers of household products with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have diversified our customer base  we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the people s republic of china prc and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in brazil  the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our long term relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 
in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  developing new products  expanding volume and increasing prices 
in we expect to complete a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities  a project that in began to generate productivity gains and cost reductions in the metal beverage packaging  americas  segment 
while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the european  asian and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow 
we are capitalizing on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities and by announcing plans to establish a plant in india 
to better position the company in the european market  the capacity from the fire damaged hassloch  germany  plant was replaced with a mix of steel beverage can manufacturing capacity in the hassloch plant and aluminum beverage can manufacturing capacity in the company s hermsdorf  germany  plant 
all three lines were in commercial production by the end of the second quarter of additionally  the company has announced plans for speeding up certain lines in europe and building a new plant in poland 
we are also considering additional can and end manufacturing capacity there and in the prc 
the company regularly evaluates expansion opportunities in growing international markets  including existing and developing markets in europe  the prc  brazil and other parts of the world 
we recently announced our intention to build a beverage can manufacturing plant in india  as well as the new plant in poland to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there and in central and eastern europe 
we also recently announced the company s participation in a one line metal beverage can plant in brazil 
this plant will be owned by ball s unconsolidated percent owned joint venture  latapack ball embalagens  ltda  and its construction will be financed by cash flows from the joint venture 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging 
this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food and household products customers 
as part of this focus  we are installing a new ounce can production line in our monticello  indiana  facility expected to be operational in mid ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report 
page of the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
our present contract mix consists of approximately percent cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  while the remainder are fixed price contracts 
we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
failure to be awarded certain key contracts could adversely affect segment performance during compared to throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management uses various measures to evaluate company performance 
the primary financial metric we use is economic value added tax effected operating earnings  as defined by the company  less a charge for net operating assets employed 
our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis 
other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates  quality control figures  environmental  health and safety statistics and production and shipment volumes 
additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and  because of this  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various stock compensation plans 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to own ball stock 
consolidated sales and earnings the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas metal beverage packaging  americas  metal beverage packaging  europe asia  metal food and household products packaging  americas  plastic packaging  americas  and aerospace and technologies 
we also have investments in companies in the us  the prc and brazil  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 
effective january   a plastic pail product line with net sales of million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment to the plastic packaging  americas  segment 
prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to the current presentation 
page of metal beverage packaging  americas the metal beverage packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and puerto rico  which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging 
during the second quarter of  miller brewing company miller  a us customer  asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary  and on october   the dispute was settled in mediation 
miller received million million after tax on settlement of the dispute and ball retained all of miller s beverage can and end supply through miller received a one time payment of approximately million million after tax in january recorded on the december   consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract through including the reduction in net sales resulting from the legal settlement  this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
sales were percent higher in than in with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices  which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers 
these favorable factors were offset by the legal settlement  which decreased sales by percent in as compared to sales were percent higher in than in due to an increase in beverage can shipments in excess of percent coupled with higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers 
the higher can shipments over were driven by favorable weather in many parts of the us and canada  as well as the promotion of ounce can packages by beer and soft drink companies 
based on publicly available information  we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately percent of total us and canadian shipments in we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business  which includes cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes  and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 
including the effect of the legal settlement  earnings in the segment were million in compared to million in and million in contributing to the higher segment earnings in  before the legal settlement  compared to were gains from sourcing of raw materials that totaled approximately million 
also contributing were approximately million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies 
these gains were offset by increased repairs and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs  a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers 
the third quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities 
the project is expected to be largely completed in segment earnings growth in compared to before the end project charge  although aided by percent higher sales in  was constrained by product mix and continued year over year cost growth  particularly higher energy  other direct material and freight costs  which  combined  were approximately million higher than in metal beverage packaging  europe asia the metal beverage packaging  europe asia  segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured and sold in europe and asia  as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
ball packaging europe  which represents an estimated percent of total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity  has manufacturing plants located in germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  poland and serbia 
segment sales in were percent higher than in  due to over percent sales volume growth  higher pricing and a percent year over year impact from the increase in the euro 
higher segment volumes were aided by overall market dynamics in europe that favor beverage cans  as well as growth in europe of custom can volumes 
offsetting these favorable volume trends were the impacts of the colder and wetter than normal summer weather in many parts of europe 
page of segment can shipments were more than percent higher in than in higher segment sales volumes were aided by strong european demand  favorable european weather  germany hosting the world cup soccer championship during june and july and continued growth in the prc market 
segment sales  which grew percent in  also benefited slightly from the strength of the euro 
the new beverage can plant in belgrade  serbia  built to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe  became fully operational during the third quarter of the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth 
ball has announced its intention to increase capacity in this segment through the construction of a beverage can manufacturing plant in india  as well as a second beverage can plant in poland 
earnings in the segment were million in  million in and million in segment earnings in included a million property insurance gain related to a fire at the company s hassloch  germany  metal beverage can plant further details are provided below 
the fourth quarter of included a million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidating prc operations for amounts less than originally estimated 
first quarter segment earnings included a million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc 
segment earnings in compared to  excluding the million property insurance gain  increased due to a combination of million in net margin increases from higher sales volumes and price recovery initiatives  million from cost control programs and million due to a stronger euro 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in and million of other higher costs 
segment earnings in were higher than in due largely to percent sales higher volumes  certain price recovery initiatives and effective manufacturing and selling  general and administrative cost controls 
these gains were partially offset by higher raw material  freight and energy costs  and price cost compression in the prc 
on april   a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch  germany  damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment 
the property insurance proceeds recorded for the year ended december   which were based on replacement cost  were million million  of which million million was received in april  million million was received in october and the remainder of million million  which was recorded in other long term assets at december   was received in january a million million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire 
as a result  a pretax gain of million million was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds 
an additional million million and million million were recorded in cost of sales in and  respectively  for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs  as well as million million in to offset clean up costs 
metal food and household products packaging  americas the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and argentina 
the company acquired us can corporation us can on march   and with that acquisition  added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans  paint cans  plastic pails and decorative specialty cans 
effective january   responsibility for the plastic pail product line with net sales of million was transferred to the plastic packaging  americas  segment 
accordingly  segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 
segment sales in constituted percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent higher than sales 
the higher sales were impacted by percent for the inclusion of a full year s sales from the acquisition of us can  partially offset by lost business that resulted in a sales decline of percent  as well as customer operating issues in food cans  including a fire in a customer s factory  and unfavorable weather conditions in the midwest 
page of segment sales in were percent higher than sales 
the primary reason for the increase was percent higher sales due to the acquisition of us can  combined with the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by percent lower third quarter food can volumes 
during  and  we were not able to pass through all of the steel price increases and surcharges levied by steel producers and this resulted in margin compression 
based on publicly available trade information  we estimate our shipments of billion steel food containers and billion aerosol containers to be approximately percent and percent of total us and canadian metal food container and steel aerosol container shipments  respectively 
a segment loss of million was incurred in compared to earnings of million in and million in these amounts included pretax charges of million in  million in and million in  respectively  for business consolidation activities 
the percent lower earnings in compared to before the business consolidation activity charges were due to increased steel and coating material costs  partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of related to million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory 
higher sales volumes related to the us can acquisition helped improve segment earnings in the last nine months of  despite the negative impact of lower food can volumes attributable to the loss of a customer in late and a poor salmon harvest in additionally  segment earnings in were reduced by the million of purchase accounting adjustments discussed previously  partially offset by lower freight and other direct material costs of million 
while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials  other direct materials and freight and utility costs  we continue to seek price increases in the market place to improve our margins 
on october   ball announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities and to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in baltimore  maryland 
ball will close its food and household products packaging facilities in tallapoosa  georgia  and commerce  california  both of which manufacture aerosol and general line cans 
the two plant closures will result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of production lines  including the relocation of two high speed aerosol lines into existing ball facilities  and will allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base 
when completed throughout  the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than percent from about percent 
the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries 
a pretax charge of million million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to these closures 
we also recorded a million million after tax pension annuity expense related to a previously closed plant 
in october the company announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities in north america by the end of that year as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment following the acquisition of us can earlier in the year 
the company closed a leased facility in alliance  ohio  which was one of manufacturing locations acquired from us can  and a plant in burlington  ontario  which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition 
the closure of the ohio plant was treated as an opening balance sheet item 
a pretax charge of million million after tax was recorded in  primarily related to the burlington closure  for employee termination and pension costs  plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment  as well as the shut down of a metal food can manufacturing line in the whitby  ontario  plant 
when the burlington building is sold  the estimated costs of the closures will be cash flow neutral after tax benefits and anticipated proceeds 
the year ended december   included a net pretax charge of million million after tax for pension  severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in the burlington plant combined with the closure of a three piece food can manufacturing plant in quebec 
the company continues to evaluate the segment s manufacturing structure and expects to identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies 
additional details regarding business consolidation activities are available in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item of this annual report 
page of plastic packaging  americas the plastic packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us and canada that manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging  as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications 
on march   ball acquired certain north american plastic bottle container assets from alcan packaging alcan  including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada  as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities 
effective january   the plastic packaging  americas  segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the us can acquisition 
accordingly  segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 
segment sales in comprised percent of consolidated net sales percent in and increased percent compared to primarily due to an increase of percent related to the march acquisition of alcan and the inclusion of the acquired us can plastic pail business  as well as an increase of percent for higher sales volumes 
segment sales in increased percent compared to  including percent related to plant and other asset acquisitions from alcan and us can and percent related to higher sales volumes 
in view of the substandard performance related to our pet soft drink margins  we continue to focus on price recovery initiatives  as well as our pet development efforts in the custom hot fill  beer  wine  flavored alcoholic beverage  and specialty container markets 
in the polypropylene plastic container arena  development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 
segment earnings were million in  million in and million in earnings were lower in than in primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately million of customer pricing concessions and million of higher labor and overhead costs 
the earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately million from volume growth in specialty pet sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of related to the acquired alcan and us can plants 
segment earnings in were higher than in largely due to the margin impact of the incremental sales related to the alcan and us can acquisitions  partially offset by million of higher energy and labor costs and approximately million incurred for a litigation claim that was favorably resolved in july earnings in the second quarter of also included purchase accounting adjustments of million  which increased cost of sales due to the valuation of inventories associated with the acquired alcan finished goods inventory 
we estimate our shipments of billion pet plastic bottles to be approximately percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 
in addition  the plastic packaging  americas  segment produced approximately million food and specialty containers during aerospace and technologies aerospace and technologies segment sales represented percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent higher than in sales in were percent lower than in the higher sales in were due to new programs  cost overruns and increased scope on previously awarded contracts  with million attributable to the worldview and other commercial space operations contracts 
lower sales in compared to were largely due to contracts being completed during the period  as well as the impact of government funding reductions and program delays 
the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large  strategic contracts and delivered a considerable amount of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the three year period 
segment earnings were million in  million in and million in earnings improvement in was primarily due to higher net sales  particularly million related to the worldview and other commercial space contracts  an improved contract mix and better program execution 
earnings in were negatively affected by lower sales due to program delays and unfavorable contract mix 
the first quarter of included expense of million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company 
this investment was sold in october for approximately its carrying value 
page of some of the segment s high profile contracts include the worldview and worldview advanced commercial remote sensing satellites  the james webb space telescope  a successor to the hubble space telescope  the space based space surveillance system  which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris  npoess  the next generation satellite weather monitoring system  and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 
sales to the us government  either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor  represented percent of segment sales in  percent of segment sales in and percent in contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
year to year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 
additional segment information for additional information regarding the company s segments  see the summary of business segment information in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management  actuaries and others and were developed from information available at the time 
if actual outcomes vary from the estimates  the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses 
additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
contributing to higher expenses in compared to were million of additional sg a from the us can acquisition  higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of million  increased sales and marketing efforts of million and million of compensation and benefit increases  including year over year incentive compensation costs 
also  a million out of period foreign currency adjustment was included in sg a expenses in the first quarter of discussed in further detail in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item of this report 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared to was primarily the result of million of incremental sg a after realized synergies from the acquired us can operations  the million out of period foreign currency adjustment  higher expense of million associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  million for higher rates associated with the company s receivables sales agreement  million of increased legal fees related to patent litigation  million for an initial mark to market adjustment to one of the company s deferred compensation stock plans due to a plan amendment  as well as compensation and benefit increases 
interest and taxes consolidated interest expense was million in  million in and million  including debt refinancing costs of million  in the higher expense for each successive year was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets  combined with higher interest rates in the debt refinancing costs in of million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of of the company s senior notes  which were due in august ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in the lower effective rate in was the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of million recorded in the third quarter of  as compared to million in these net tax benefit adjustments were the result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company s canadian operations 
these benefits were offset by a tax provision to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded in the quarter with the internal revenue service irs related to a company owned life insurance plan discussed below 
based on current estimates  the effective income tax rate is expected to be around percent 
page of during the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company owned life insurance plan 
an additional accrual of million was made in the third quarter to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of million  including interest  for the years  which were under examination  and for the unaudited years this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans  which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share  cash flow or liquidity in future periods 
further details are available in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
while the effective tax rates for and are similar  the rate was impacted by a tax benefit of million associated with a foreign exchange loss as a result of the change in the functional currency of a european subsidiary in the local statutory accounts 
the one time benefit was somewhat offset by a higher foreign tax rate differential due to taxation of the german property insurance gain at the marginal rate of percent and a valuation allowance on a canadian net operating loss resulting from the business consolidation costs 
the rate was impacted by the tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings at legislated reduced rates plus the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the higher marginal rate 
results of equity affiliates equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil 
earnings were million in  million in and million in critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the company s critical and significant accounting policies  as well as recent accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and revolver borrowings  when necessary  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products  which could arise from competitive circumstances  or any of the other factors we describe in item a  risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in the improvement over was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in and the insurance gain in related to the hassloch fire 
the improvement in was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments  partially offset by higher pension contributions 
cash flows from operating activities in were negatively affected by higher cash pension funding and higher working capital levels compared to the prior year 
the higher working capital was a combination of higher than planned raw material inventory levels  higher income tax payments and higher accounts receivable balances  the latter resulting primarily from the repayment of a portion of the accounts receivable securitization program and late payments from customers in europe 
management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  to plan stock buy back levels  to evaluate strategic investments and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
an example of such an item included in is the property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our hassloch  germany  plant  which page of are included in capital spending amounts 
another example is the company s decision in to contribute an additional million million to its pension plans as part of its overall debt reduction plan 
based on this  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities incremental pension funding  net of tax capital spending proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets free cash flow based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be approximately million  capital spending to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the million range 
capital spending of million net of million in insurance recoveries in was below depreciation and amortization expense of million 
we continue to invest capital in our best performing operations  including projects to increase custom can capabilities  improve beverage can and end making productivity and add more beverage can capacity in europe  as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 
of the million of planned capital spending for  approximately million will be spent on top line sales growth projects 
debt facilities and refinancing interest bearing debt at december   decreased million to  million from  million at december  the debt decrease from was primarily attributed to debt payments offset by higher foreign exchange rates 
at december   million was available under the company s multi currency revolving credit facilities 
the company also had million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year  of which million was outstanding 
on october   ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities and during the third and fourth quarters of  ball redeemed its senior notes due august primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities 
the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of million million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing  revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball s north american packaging operations  up to million 
the agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december   and has met all payment obligations 
the us note agreements  bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends  investments  financial ratios  guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
additional details about the company s receivables sales agreement and debt are available in notes and  respectively  accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
page of other liquidity items cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases  purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments on long term debt b operating leases purchase obligations c common stock repurchase agreements legal settlement total payments on contractual obligations a amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end exchange rates 
b for variable rate facilities  amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments 
c the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel  plastic resin and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  are expected to be million in this estimate may change based on plan asset performance 
benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december  through  respectively  and a total of million for the years through payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately million in each of the years through and a total of million for the years through in accordance with united kingdom pension regulations  ball has provided an million guarantee to the plan for its defined benefit plan in the united kingdom 
if the company s credit rating falls below specified levels  ball will be required to either contribute an additional million to the plan  provide a letter of credit to the plan in that amount or if imposed by the appropriate regulatory agency  provide a lien on company assets in that amount for the benefit of the plan 
the guarantee can be removed upon approval by both ball and the pension plan trustees 
our share repurchase program in was million  net of issuances  compared to million net repurchases in and million in the net repurchases included the million settlement on january   of a forward contract entered into in december for the repurchase of  shares 
however  the net repurchases did not include a forward contract entered into in december for the repurchase of  shares 
the contract was settled on january   for million in cash 
on december   in a privately negotiated transaction  ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings 
the company advanced the million on january   and received approximately million shares  which represented percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous day s closing price 
the exact number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement  which will be determined on the settlement date no later than june   is subject to an adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date 
the company has the option to settle the contract in either cash or shares 
including the settlements of the forward share purchase contract and the accelerated share repurchase agreement  we expect to repurchase approximately million of our common shares  net of issuances  in annual cash dividends paid on common stock were cents per share in  and total dividends paid were million in  million in and million in page of contingencies the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate  our operations in developing markets outside the us  changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets 
where practicable  we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures  including  at times  the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item a of this report 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business 
additionally  the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party  along with numerous other companies  for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites 
our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
future events could affect these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report for a summary of the company s critical and significant accounting policies 
the us and european economies have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years 
management believes that evaluation of ball s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our k  q and k reports to the securities and exchange commission 
page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in regard to common share repurchases 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum component pricing 
this matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal beverage packaging  americas  net sales 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract 
most of the plastic packaging  americas  sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes 
as a result  we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin 
most metal food and household products packaging  americas  sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
in and  we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases 
we anticipate that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur through the end of in europe and asia  the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales of containers  that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price  floating and pass through pricing arrangements 
we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes 
we also use option contracts to limit the impacts of european inflation in certain multi year contracts 
considering the effects of derivative instruments  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel  aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by percent  we estimate there could be a million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in our diesel fuel surcharge could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
page of interest rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges 
in addition  we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  brazilian real  argentine peso and serbian dinar 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this amount includes the million currency exposure discussed above in the commodity price risk section 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
common share repurchases in connection with the company s ongoing share repurchases  the company periodically sells put options  which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options 
our objective in selling put options is to lower the average purchase price of acquired shares 
there were no put option contracts outstanding at the end of on december   ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of  shares of its common stock 
this agreement was settled for million on january   and the shares were delivered that day 
on december   we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately million 
the agreement provided for the delivery of approximately million shares  which represented percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered 
the million was paid on january   at the time the shares were delivered 
the remaining shares and average price per share will be determined at the conclusion of the contract  which is expected to occur no later than june  page of
