item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with i our audited financial statements as at and for the year ended july   as at and for the seven months ended july   and as at and for the year ended december  and the related notes  and ii the section of this annual report entitled description of business that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in the section entitled risk factors 
our financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
in june  we determined to change our fiscal year end from december to july accordingly  on october   we filed a transition report on form ksb for the period year ended july   as subsequently amended  with the sec and commenced a new reporting period 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on may  during  we changed our business operations focus from precious metals exploration in the state of nevada to the exploration for economic reserves of uranium throughout the united states 
since then  we have been acquiring mineral property interests in the united states 
in addition  we restated our audited financial statements for the fiscal period ended july  and fiscal year ended december  to account for the re evaluation of impairment analysis performed at each respective period and to correct for errors in recording database related transactions 
accordingly  the financial information presented below may not be comparable from period to period 
plan of operations our plan of operations for the next twelve months is to continue with the exploration of our mineral properties 
our planned geological exploration programs are described in detail in this annual report under description of business and properties 
our planned exploration expenditures for the next twelve months on our mineral properties  together with amounts due to maintain our interest in these claims  are summarized as follows name of property planned exploration expenditures amounts of claims maintenance due amount of property payment due total goliad nil the following sets forth information relating to all fees and other payments required to be made by us in the next twelve months mining claims lease maintenance payments access agreement fees database maintenance fees  holley option payment nil nil nil nil cibola jv payment  cibola jv advance royalty payment  cibola jv scholarship contribution nil in addition  we will incur general and administrative expenses throughout the year that we anticipate will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to our regulatory filings throughout the year  as well as transfer agent fees  management fees  investor relations and general office expenses 
we had cash in the amount of  and a working capital surplus in the amount of  as of july  we anticipate that existing cash resources will be sufficient to carry out our exploration programs and plan of operations for the next twelve months  but that is dependent on implementing management plans relating to cost reduction and cash spending programs 
we will require additional financing to pursue our plan of operations for the next months  however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  on terms favorable to us or at all 
beyond the next twelve months  we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue our plan of operations as we anticipate that we will not earn any revenues in the foreseeable future 
we believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing 
we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock 
however  we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our exploration programs 
in the absence of such financing  we will not be able to continue exploration of our mineral claims 
even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund our exploration programs  there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced exploration of our mi neral claims following the completion of preliminary exploration 
if we do not continue to obtain additional financing  we may be forced to abandon our properties and our plan of operations 
we may consider entering into a joint venture arrangement to provide the required funding to pursue drilling and advanced exploration of our mineral claims 
even if we determined to pursue a joint venture partner  there is no assurance that any third party would enter into a joint venture agreement with us in order to fund exploration of our mineral claims 
if we entered into a joint venture arrangement  we would likely have to assign a percentage of our interest in our mineral claims to the joint venture partner 
our exploration plans will be continually evaluated and modified as exploration results become available 
modifications to our plans will be based on many factors  including results of exploration  assessment of data  weather conditions  exploration costs  the price of uranium and available capital 
further  the extent of our exploration programs that we undertake will be dependent upon the amount of financing available to us 
results of operations we are an exploration stage company and have not generated any revenue to date

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
mineral property costs we are primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration and development of mineral properties 
mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred in accordance with eitf  whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets 
at the end of each fiscal quarter end  the company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if proven and probable reserves are established for a property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed  costs will be amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve 
mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
as of the date of this annual report  we have not established any proven or probable reserves on our mineral properties and have incurred only acquisition and exploration costs 
databases costs related to internally developed databases are expensed as incurred 
costs of acquired mineral property databases are capitalized upon acquisition 
mineral property data bases are tested for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
mineral property databases are amortized over five years using the straight line method 
restoration and remediation costs asset retirement obligations various federal and state mining laws and regulations require us to reclaim the surface areas and restore underground water quality for its mine projects to the pre existing mine area average quality after the completion of mining 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  we will capitalize the measured fair value of asset retirement obligations to mineral rights and properties 
the asset retirement obligations would be accreted to an undiscounted value until the time at which it they are expected to be settled 
actual retirement costs will be recorded against the asset retirement obligations when incurred 
any difference between the recorded asset retirement obligations and the actual retirement costs incurred will be recorded as a gain or loss in the period of settlement 
future reclamation and remediation costs  which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation  are accrued based on management s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at each project 
such estimates would be determined by our engineering studies calculating the cost of future of surface and groundwater activities  current regulations  actual expenses incurred  and technology and industry standards 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
financial instruments the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  other current monetary assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
our operations and financing activities are conducted primarily in united states dollars  and as a result we are not subject to significant exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates 
management has determined that we are not exposed to significant credit risk 
stock based compensation on january   the we adopted sfas no
