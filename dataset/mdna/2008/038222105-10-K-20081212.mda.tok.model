product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america  europe  israel and asia 
applied s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 
applied s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
each of applied s businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips  lcds  solar pvs and other electronic devices  as well as other factors  such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes 
the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions  except per share amounts and percentages new orders net sales gross margin gross margin percent net income earnings per share fiscal financial results reflected decreased demand for semiconductor equipment and  to a lesser extent  service products  due to unfavorable market conditions in the semiconductor industry  partially offset by increased demand for lcd and solar products 
new orders decreased from fiscal due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory  foundry and logic chip manufacturers  partially offset by increased demand by lcd customers and  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the recognition of orders for applied s sunfab tm thin film line for manufacturing solar panels 
net sales decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decline in investment from memory and logic customers  partially offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon c si solar manufacturing products 
net income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower net sales  offset in part by lower operating expenses 
fiscal financial results included charges associated with restructuring programs 

table of contents fiscal financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry s recovery in  while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for lcd tvs 
total orders decreased slightly from fiscal  primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products  partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments 
net sales increased during fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to strong demand from dynamic random access memory dram and flash memory chip manufacturers  partially offset by a significant decline in lcd equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial investment in net income improved in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher sales and lower operating expenses  offset in part by lower interest income 
fiscal financial results included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products  and an in process research and development ipr d expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks automation  inc brooks software 
fiscal results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries along with the global economy  as end user demand for electronic products and lcds drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon particularly memory and display products compared to fiscal during this period  applied s semiconductor customers increased both high volume production and leading edge nm and nm chip development 
improvements in operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges  and an ipr d expense associated with the acquisition of applied films corporation applied films 
applied expects an unusually challenging environment for fiscal the turmoil in the financial markets and weakening global economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical markets in which applied operates 
current negative trends in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty have led some customers to decrease factory operations and to reassess their projected spending plans 
as a result  on november   applied announced that it will implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  applied s ability to forecast customers future investments and its financial targets are limited in this uncertain macroeconomic climate 
applied currently expects that orders and revenue will be down overall and across most segments in fiscal  with the exception of the energy and environmental solutions segment

as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
applied expects that changes in its business will affect its working capital components  primarily related to its energy and environmental solutions segment  which includes products for manufacturing solar pvs 
applied believes that the solar industry is moving to increasingly greater factory output of solar modules  including projects with an output capable of generating electricity on a gigawatt scale 
applied has entered into contracts with multiple customers for its sunfab tm thin film line  for projects of varying scale 
fulfillment of these contracts requires applied to invest in inventory particularly work in process  and applied may obtain customer deposits that reduce the associated effect on other working capital components 
applied s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade municipal bonds  money market mutual funds  us treasury and agency securities  corporate bonds  equity securities  and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures  which may include the sale of certain securities  to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies 
in fiscal  as part of its regular investment review process  applied recorded an insignificant impairment charge 
table of contents associated with its investment portfolio 
at october   applied had a gross unrealized loss of million due to a decrease in the fair market value of certain fixed rate debt and equity securities as a result of the recent turmoil in the global financial markets 
applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair market value has been lower than the cost basis  the financial condition  credit quality and near term prospects of the investee  and applied s ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value 
generally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments 
while applied cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  applied believes that its investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in its investment portfolio 
the following types of financial instruments may present additional risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns structured investment vehicles  auction rate securities  sub prime and alt a mortgage backed securities  and collateralized debt obligations 
at october   applied s holdings in these categories of investments totaled million  or of total cash  cash equivalents and investments  which applied does not consider to be material 
in the event that these categories of investments become illiquid  applied does not believe that this will materially affect the company s liquidity or results of operations 
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
in november  applied announced that it had temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to maintain financial flexibility in light of the deteriorating global economic and market conditions

off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  and b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods 

table of contents in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  the company has certain tax obligations 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the company historically has classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities 
upon adoption of fin  the company reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   the company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and gross interest and penalties of million 
of the million in interest and penalties  million is classified as long term payable and million is classified as current payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and  accordingly  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach  and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
equity based compensation employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans effective on october   applied began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award  and applied has elected to use the straight line method 
the fair value of restricted stock units is calculated based upon the fair market value of applied s common stock at the date of grant see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
applied s primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october  and october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
all of applied s debt bears interest at fixed rates 
therefore  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
