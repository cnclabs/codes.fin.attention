item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail  including stores and e commerce  and independent distributors  franchisees and licensees in the united states and worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories businesses 
our strategy is to create long term revenue growth by creating compelling consumer experiences by creating and delivering innovative  must have products  deep personal connections with our brands  and compelling retail presentation 
we strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin  and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs improving working capital efficiency deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders by executing this strategy  we aim to deliver the following long term financial goals high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  
table of contents increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
in fiscal we met or exceeded these financial goals

for the year  the increase in net income was higher than our rate of revenue growth due to a reduction in our effective tax rate and improved gross margins  partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
fiscal results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of percentage points as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the million one time tax benefit received in the first quarter of fiscal also reflected in the year over year effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside of the united states  our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 
gross margins for the year grew basis points versus the prior year as inventory management and strategic price increases were partially offset by higher product costs and increased close out sales 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to higher investments in growth drivers such as athlete and sport team endorsers of our products  spending around major sporting events  key product initiatives  investments in company owned retail and non nike brand businesses as well as normal wage increases 
our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program 
in addition  we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased cash paid for share repurchases 
our return on invested capital increased as compared to fiscal although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year  we continue to believe these are appropriate long term goals

fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  other expense income  net was primarily comprised of the million gain on the sale leaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration  offset by foreign currency hedge losses 
the foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts 
the change in other expense income  net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal  which were more than offset by the converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our oregon footwear distribution center discussed above  compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal  which were more than offset by the million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the converse arbitration

these benefits included the year european tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal  which is effective for fiscal years through this agreement  which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 
table of contents futures orders worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were more than higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period  which approximate current spot rates 
the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately percentage points to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year 
excluding this currency impact  unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders 
the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders  and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders  including at once and close out sales of nike footwear and apparel  wholesale sales of equipment  cole haan  converse  hurley  umbro  nike golf and retail sales across all brands

outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand payable to sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  generally for the purchase of inventory 
capital resources in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec under which billion in debt securities may be issued 
in may  we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the program have issued million in medium term notes 
as of may   million in medium term notes remained outstanding 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
during fiscal  one of our japanese subsidiaries entered into a total of billion approximately million as of may  in short term loans to meet general operating needs 
the interest rates on the loans are based on the prevailing tokyo interbank offer rate of our election plus a spread  resulting in a weighted average all in rate of at may  during fiscal  another of our japanese subsidiaries entered into a billion approximately million as of may  loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the six month japanese yen london interbank offer rate jpy libor plus a spread resulting in an all in rate of approximately at may  this loan facility was renewed during fiscal subsequent to may   this loan facility expired and was replaced with intercompany borrowings 
during fiscal  the same japanese subsidiary entered into a billion approximately million as of may  term loan that replaced certain intercompany borrowings and matures on february  the interest rate on the loan is approximately and interest is paid semi annually 
as of may   we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year  billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks 
the facility matures in december and can be extended for one additional year on its next anniversary date 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the 
table of contents event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was no amount outstanding at may  or may  we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future

 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the provisions of fas are effective for the quarter ending february  we do not expect that the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result 
table of contents in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded within other expense income  net 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests require the use of discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  expenditures and working capital 
these estimates are determined by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinite lived intangible assets would be classified within other expense income  net 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any significant impairment charges would be classified within other expense income  net 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted fas  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by fas  we are 
table of contents required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense income  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
when appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with fas  the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 
as the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed  the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk 
accordingly  the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness 
in accordance with fas  we consider  on a quarterly basis  the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment 
should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels  any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 
stock based compensation as of the first quarter of fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fas r 
under the provisions of fas r  the fair value of stock based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists 
table of contents that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  settled audit issues and new audit activity 
changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense income  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses  we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 

table of contents when we begin hedging exposures  the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our european subsidiaries 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  british pounds  and japanese yen 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of commercial paper  bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in var as of may  occurred due to a higher notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments coupled with increased foreign currency volatility as of may  compared to may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 

table of contents details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below 
the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may  expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk euro functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan british pound denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency intercompany loan euro denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan japanese yen denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate japanese yen functional currency japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate swapped to floating rate principal payments average interest rate long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties  as discussed above 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly re measurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary 

table of contents in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period 
the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may   and
