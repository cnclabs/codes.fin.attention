item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see exhibit selected consolidated financial data of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in marketable equity security prices 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
caption our investment performance is a function of our portfolio companies profitability  which may be affected by economic cycles  competitive forces  foreign currency fluctuations and production costs including labor rates  raw material prices and certain basic commodity prices 
most of the companies in our investment portfolio do not hedge their exposure to raw material and commodity price fluctuations 
however  the portfolio company with the greatest exposure to foreign currency fluctuations generally hedges its exposure 
all of these factors may have an adverse effect on the value of our investments and on our net asset value 
our investment in portfolio securities includes fixed rate debt securities which totaled  at march   equivalent to of the value of our total investments 
generally  these debt securities are below investment grade and have relatively high fixed rates of interest  therefore  minor changes in market yields of publicly traded debt securities have little or no effect on the values of debt securities in our portfolio and no effect on interest income 
our investments in debt securities are generally held to maturity and their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
a portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt and equity securities of private companies 
we anticipate little or no effect on the values of these investments from modest changes in public market equity valuations 
should significant changes in market valuations of comparable publicly owned companies occur  there may be a corresponding effect on valuations of private companies  which would affect the value and the amount and timing of proceeds eventually realized from these investments 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of restricted common stocks of publicly owned companies 
the fair values of these restricted securities are influenced by the nature of applicable resale restrictions  the underlying earnings and financial condition of the issuers of such restricted securities and the market valuations of comparable publicly owned companies 
a portion of our investment portfolio also consists of unrestricted  freely marketable common stocks of publicly owned companies 
these freely marketable investments  which are valued at the public market price  are directly exposed to equity price risks  in that a change in an issuer s public market equity price would result in an identical change in the value of our investment in such security
