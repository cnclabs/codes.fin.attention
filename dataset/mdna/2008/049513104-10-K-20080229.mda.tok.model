overview of fiscal significant transactions on may   we sold our irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility for million in cash million  net of selling costs 
the sale of the facility included acres of land  the fabrication facility building and related offices  and remaining equipment 
an additional acres was retained by us 
no significant gain or loss was recorded upon the sale of the facility 
on august   we entered into collared accelerated share repurchase program with each of morgan stanley co 
incorporated and credit suisse  new york branch the dealers to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the transactions  we prepaid million to each dealer shortly after execution of the transactions  and we agreed to purchase up to million of our common stock from each dealer 
the aggregate number of shares actually purchased was determined based on the volume weighted average share price of our common stock during a specified period of time  subject to certain provisions that established a minimum and maximum number of shares that may be repurchased by us 
in september  the dealers delivered an aggregate of million shares to us  which was the minimum number of shares to be repurchased by us 
on november   we received approximately million additional shares from morgan stanley co 
incorporated and on november   we received approximately million additional shares from credit suisse  new york branch 
the total number of shares repurchased under the program was approximately million  which were retired 
no additional shares are expected to be repurchased pursuant to the collared accelerated share repurchase program 
the effective price per share of all shares repurchased under the program was

net revenues decreased to  million in from  million in  a decrease of million or approximately 
during  strong growth in our core business groups  including microcontrollers  was offset by a decline in unit volumes for our bicmos foundry business within the rf and automotive segment 
net revenues for our asic and nonvolatile memory segments remained flat or declined slightly during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues and unit volumes for bicmos foundry products related to a decline in orders from a significant customer for communication chipsets for cdma phones 
the decrease in net revenues in the asic segment is primarily due to reduced shipments of lower margin commodity telecommunication market products 
microcontroller segment revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the million reported for the year ended december  our proprietary avr microcontroller product revenues were million during  up from million recorded in the increase in revenues for microcontrollers was driven by significant new designs in consumer  wireless handset  and industrial market applications 
gross margin improved to in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  improvements to gross margin primarily resulted from lower depreciation expense related to our decision to sell our north tyneside  uk facility  as well as a more favorable mix of higher margin products sold  and improved manufacturing yields 
however  our gross margins were negatively impacted during by a significant change in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar weakening when compared to the euro as well as lower factory utilization rates  primarily for our north tyneside  uk facility  which we continued to operate while we sought to sell this facility 
we generated income from operations of million in the year ended december   compared to a loss from operations of million in the year ended december  the increase to income from operations in the year ended december  was primarily related to asset impairment charges of million and grant repayment charges of million recorded in the year ended december   which were not repeated in the year ended december  research and development expense decreased during  as we reduced spending on non core product development programs 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased million during primarily due to expenses associated with the restatement of our and prior financial statements  a special meeting of stockholders in may  and various independent investigations  as well as on going legal fees  stock based compensation costs  resources added to increase investment in sales and administrative organizations and the impact of exchange rates resulting from the weaker dollar compared to the euro 

table of contents provision for income taxes totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  during  we recognized a benefit of million resulting from the cash receipt of french research and development tax credits related to prior tax years 
provision for income taxes results primarily from taxable income in our profitable foreign subsidiaries which are profitable on a local statutory income basis 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  expressing tax provision benefit as a percentage of the applicable year s income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
we generated positive cash flows from operating activities of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  down from million at december   primarily due to million in cash paid to repurchase million shares of our common stock in the third and fourth quarters of  partially offset by million we drew from a bank line of credit in december our total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to debt repayments of million  offset by in part by million we drew from a bank line of credit in december our current liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  results of continuing operations years ended december  december  december  in thousands  except percentage of net revenues net revenues gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses charges for grant repayments asset impairment charges recovery restructuring charges loss on sale and other charges income loss from operations net revenues net revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or approximately  primarily as a result of declines in our rf and automotive and asic segments  partially offset by growth in our microcontroller segment 
net revenues for our asic and nonvolatile memory segments remained flat or declined slightly during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in net revenues and unit volumes for bicmos foundry products related to a decline in orders from a significant customer for communication chipsets for cdma phones 
the decrease in net revenues in the asic segment is primarily due to reduced shipments of lower margin commodity telecommunication market products

net revenues increased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december   an increase of million or approximately  primarily as a result of growth in our microcontroller and rf and automotive segments  offset by declines in our asic and nonvolatile memory segments 
the increase in revenues in our microcontroller segment was primarily driven by growth of our avr microcontroller products 
the increase in revenues in the rf and automotive segment is primarily related to growth 
table of contents in communication chipsets for cdma phones and strong demand for other communication products such as gps  and other rfid products 
the decline in our nonvolatile memory segment revenues was due to price declines driven by competitive pricing pressures  partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of data flash products in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation 
for the years ended december  and  we reclassified net revenues from the grenoble subsidiary to results from discontinued operations for approximately million and million  respectively  which were previously reported in our asic operating segment 
average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency net revenues in euro were approximately and euro to the dollar in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on net revenues 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported net revenues for the year ended december  would have been million lower 
net revenues by operating segment our net revenues by operating segment are summarized as follows in thousands  except percentages of net change change segment revenues from from in thousands  except percentage of net revenues asic microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive net revenues of net change change segment revenues from from asic microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive net revenues of net segment revenues asic microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive net revenues certain product families have been reassigned between the asic and microcontroller segments to improve organizational efficiency and reflect the way management evaluates segment performance 
as a result  prior period net revenues and income from operating segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation of operating segment information 
net revenues for the years ended december  and have been adjusted to reflect the divestiture of our grenoble  france  subsidiary 
net revenues from the grenoble subsidiary of million and million for the years ended december  and are excluded from consolidated net revenues and are reclassified to 
table of contents results from discontinued operations 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion 
asic asic segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to declines in smart card product revenues of and imaging product revenues of  partially offset by an increase in revenues for crypto memory products of 
the decline in smart card products is primarily due to reduced shipments of lower margin commodity telecommunication products and lower shipments in the first half of related to industry consolidation 
the decline in revenues from imaging products resulted from our decision to exit this business  which was completed in the third quarter of the increase in crypto memory products resulted from increased adoption by customers and significant new design wins in the personal computer market experienced during asic segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  our asic segment increased unit shipments due to increased demand for smart card and custom cell based integrated circuits related to demand for consumer  communications  and security based products sold by end customers 
the benefit from higher unit shipments was offset by lower average selling prices 
smart card products experienced lower revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to competitive pricing pressures 
smart card products experienced growing unit demand from applications which require small memory with high security  such as gsm cell phone applications  bank cards  national identity cards and conditional access for set top boxes 
in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation 
for the years ended december  and  net revenues reclassified to results from discontinued operations were million and million  respectively 
these results were previously reported in our asic operating segment 
microcontroller microcontroller segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to new customer designs utilizing both our proprietary avr microcontroller products as well as our arm based microcontroller products 
avr microcontroller revenue grew million or in the year ended december   compared to results for the year ended december  arm based microcontroller products revenue increased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december  net revenues for microcontroller products have increased due to gains in the bit microcontroller market and arm based microcontrollers  growth in the overall microcontroller market including recent high volume customer applications in the consumer and industrial markets  and improved delivery times resulting from higher inventory levels and increased test capacity added during the first half of overall demand for microcontrollers is driven by increased use of embedded control systems in consumer  industrial and automotive products 
microcontroller segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to new customer designs utilizing our proprietary avr microcontroller products 
avr microcontroller revenue grew in the year ended december   while other non proprietary microcontroller families increased revenue by  compared to the year ended december  increased test capacity allowed us to increase shipment rates in the first and second quarters of to satisfy backlog delinquencies from for avr microcontrollers 
in addition  market share gains in the bit microcontroller market contributed to gains in demand for microcontrollers is largely driven by increased use of embedded control systems in consumer  industrial and automotive products 
nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory segment revenues increased less than to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  within this segment  revenues increased million 
table of contents or for serial eeprom based product revenues and million or in serial flash product revenues  partially offset by reduced shipments of lower margin commodity flash memory products  which decreased revenues by million or 
markets for our nonvolatile memory products are more competitive than many other markets we sell in  and as a result  our memory products are subject to greater declines in average selling prices compared to product pricing in our other segments 
competitive pressures and rapid obsolescence of products are among several factors causing continued pricing declines in while pricing for serial eeprom based products remained steady  unit shipments increased by  compared to unit shipments for the year ended december  this product family benefits from significant market share resulting from competitive pricing and a broad range of offerings 
conditions in the nonvolatile memory segment are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future 
in an attempt to mitigate the pricing fluctuations in this market  we have shifted our focus away from lower margin commodity parallel flash products  which tend to experience greater than average sales price fluctuations  to other serial interface nonvolatile memory products 
nonvolatile segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to reduced unit selling prices 
competitive pressures and rapid obsolescence of products are among several factors causing continued pricing declines in the year ended december  during the year ended december   serial eprom based product revenues grew by compared to the year ended december  on higher volume shipments  partially offset by lower selling prices 
this product family benefits from significant market share resulting from competitive pricing and a broad range of offerings 
for the year ended december   revenues for flash based products declined compared to the year ended december   as higher unit shipments were more than offset by lower selling prices  mostly attributable to highly competitive customer markets 
rf and automotive rf and automotive segment net revenues decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to reduced shipment quantities for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for cdma phones and mixed signal products  partially offset by growth in other automotive products 
net revenues for bicmos foundry products decreased million or in the year ended december  from the year ended december   offset in part by a million or increase from other automotive products 
bicmos foundry product revenues related to cdma chipsets represented approximately of revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to of net revenues for the twelve months ended december  during the fourth quarter of  net revenues for this product represented approximately of net revenues 
during  we expect demand for these products will end  and that demand for newer versions of this product will be sourced elsewhere 
rf and automotive segment net revenues increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a revenue growth in automotive and wireless products  partially offset by a decrease in revenues for bicmos foundry products 
net revenues by geographic area our net revenues by geographic areas are summarized as follows revenues are attributed to countries based on delivery locations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
years ended december  december  december  in thousands united states europe asia rest of world 
table of contents primarily includes south africa  and central and south america net revenue amounts have been adjusted to reflect the divestiture of our grenoble  france  subsidiary 
net revenues from the grenoble subsidiary of million and million for the years ended december  and are excluded from consolidated net revenues  and are reclassified to results from discontinued operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
sales outside the united states accounted for  and of our net revenues in the years ended december   and our sales in the united states decreased million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to united states based customers continuing to redirect deliveries from domestic operations to lower cost overseas operations  as well as reduced shipments to united states based distributors 
our sales in the united states increased by million  or in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to higher volume shipment  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
our sales in europe increased million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to both higher volume shipments of arm based microcontrollers and automotive products  partially offset by reductions in smart card shipments 
in addition  revenues in increased as a result of the favorable impact from exchange rates  primarily from the increase in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported net revenues for the year ended december  would have been million lower 
our sales in europe increased by million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to higher avr and arm microcontroller shipments  partially offset by lower smart card shipments 
our sales terms for european distributors generally include very limited rights of return and stock rotation privileges 
however  as we evaluate how to refine our distribution strategy  we may need to modify our sales terms or make changes to our distributor base  which may impact our future revenues in this region 
it may take time for us to convert systems and processes to support modified sales terms 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to manage this optimization process in an efficient and timely manner 
our sales in asia decreased million  or  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to reduced shipment quantities for bicmos foundry products related to communication chipsets for cdma phones delivered to singapore 
for the year ended december   net revenues decreased million for bicmos foundry products  compared to the year ended december  the decline in revenues during was partially offset by increased shipments of avr microcontrollers  as well as serial flash and serial eeprom products 
our sales in asia were flat for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  higher avr microcontroller demand in the year ended december  was offset by decreased shipments and lower pricing for nonvolatile memory products  due to competitive factors  along with constrained test capacity for certain memory products 
the trend over the last several years has been an increase in revenues in asia except for singapore  while revenues from shipments to the united states has either declined or grown at a much slower rate 
we believe that part of this shift reflects changes in customer manufacturing trends  with many customers increasing production in asia due to lower labor costs 
while revenues in asia declined in compared to and  we expect that asia revenues will grow more rapidly than other regions in the future 
revenues in asia may be impacted in the future as we refine our distribution strategy and optimize our distributor base in asia 
it may take time for us to identify financially viable distributors and help them develop high quality support services 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to manage this optimization process in an efficient and timely manner 
revenues and costs impact from changes to foreign exchange rates changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  have had a significant impact on our net revenues and operating costs 
net revenues denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  were approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents net revenues in euros amounted to approximately  and of net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net revenues in japanese yen amounted to approximately for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
average annual exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euro were approximately  and euro to the dollar in the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue but an unfavorable impact on operating costs with the result that income from operations declined since a greater portion of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies than net revenues 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been approximately million lower 
however  our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues 
for the year ended december   of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
had average exchange rates for the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rates for year ended december   our operating expenses would have been approximately million lower cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect resulted in a decrease to income from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of unfavorable exchange rates when compared to the year ended december  average exchange rates utilized to translate revenues and expenses were approximately euro to the dollar in both the years ended december  and  and there was minimal impact on our operating results to the years ended december  from however within  the impact from costs denominated in foreign currency increased significantly and negatively impacted gross margins and profitability in the fourth quarter of cost of revenues and gross margin our cost of revenues includes the costs of wafer fabrication  assembly and test operations  changes in inventory reserves and freight costs 
our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues fluctuates  depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
gross margin improved to in the year ended december   compared to and in the years ended december  and respectively 
improvements to gross margin primarily resulted from lower depreciation expense related to our decision to sell our north tyneside  uk facility  as well as a more favorable mix of higher margin products sold  and improved manufacturing yields 
however  our gross margins were negatively impacted during by a significant change in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the us dollar weakening when compared to the euro as well as lower factory utilization rates  primarily for our north tyneside  uk facility  which we continued to operate while we sought to sell this facility 
from time to time  our average selling prices for certain semiconductor products may decline below our manufacturing costs  which will adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
because inventory reserves are recorded in advance of when the related inventory is sold  subsequent gross margins in the period of sale may be higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write downs 
the impact on gross margins from the sale of previously written down inventory was not material in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserves recorded impact all of our product categories  while lower of cost or market inventory reserves primarily impact our non volatile memory and smart card products 
we receive economic assistance grants in some locations as an incentive to achieve certain hiring and investment goals related to manufacturing operations  the benefit for which is recognized as an offset to related costs 
we recognized a reduction to cost of revenues for such grants of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the offset to cost of revenues in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to our 
table of contents december decision to sell our north tyneside  uk facility  which precludes us from recognizing any further benefits 
research and development research and development r d expenses decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  research and development expense decreased during  as we reduced spending on non core product development programs and related product wafers 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the number of development wafers used in technology development  which totaled a cost of million  lower depreciation and amortization expense of million  higher research grant and non recurring engineering nre funding benefits of million  offset in part by an increase in stock based compensation expense of million 
r d expenses during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by approximately million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation 
as a percentage of net revenues  r d expenses totaled for both the years ended december  and  respectively 
r d expenses increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to reduced r d grant benefit recognition of million  higher design software costs of million  increased salaries and other expenses of million and stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by lower depreciation expense of million  and lower costs for development wafers of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  r d expenses totaled for both the years ended december  and in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation 
in the years ended december  and  r d expenses were reclassified to results from discontinued operations  totaling approximately million and million  respectively  which were previously reported in our asic segment 
we have continued to invest in a variety of product areas and process technologies 
we have also continued to purchase or license technology when necessary in order to bring products to market in a timely fashion 
in the future  we expect to increase r d investment in our core products  focusing on fewer but more profitable development projects 
in addition  we expect to increase both salary and stock based compensation expense in order to recruit and retain highly skilled engineering resources 
we believe that continued strategic investments in process technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we receive r d grants from various european research organizations  the benefit of which is recognized as an offset to related costs 
we recognized million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased professional fees of million related to legal and accounting services incurred during the restatement process and subsequent special stockholder meeting in may  as well as increased employee salaries and benefits of million  and an increase in stock option compensation charges of million  partially offset by a decrease in litigation settlement costs of million incurred in sg a expenses in the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by approximately million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuation 
sg a expenses totaled and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sg a expenses increased by to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million  net legal expense of million resulting from the agere and other litigation settlements  higher sales and administrative compensation of million  less than million of reduction in allowance for bad debt compared to an approximate million reversal benefit of bad debt expense in the year ended december  and other expense of million 
legal fees in the year ended december  were million higher than in the year ended december  in the year ended december   we incurred 
table of contents significant legal fees related to several litigation cases resolved in the first half of the year 
in the year ended december   legal fees were generally lower until the second half of  when sg a expense included million related to the independent investigation of historical stock option practices and related matters  and litigation costs related to the termination of former executive officers 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses totaled and for the years ended december  and  respectively

charges for grant repayments in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intention to close our design facility in greece and our intention to sell our manufacturing facility in north tyneside  united kingdom 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the expected repayment of subsidy grants previously received and recognized related to grant agreements with government agencies at these locations 
the proceeds of the subsidy grants were originally recorded as either a reduction of cost of revenues or research and development expense when they were recognized during the period from to in the year ended december   we recorded additional interest expense of million related to the expected grant repayments 
all of these charges have been included in charges for grant repayments on the consolidated statements of operations 
we receive economic incentive grants and allowances from european governments targeted at increasing employment at specific locations 
the subsidy grant agreements typically contain economic incentive and other covenants that must be met to receive and retain grant benefits 
noncompliance with the conditions of the grants could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
in addition  we may need to record charges to reverse grant benefits recorded in prior periods as a result of changes to our plans for headcount  project spending  or capital investment at any of these specific locations 
if we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant agreements  our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected

asset impairment charges recovery under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values 
we present impairment charges as a separate line item within operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
we classify long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until they are disposed  including assets not available for immediate sale in their present condition 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of by sale under the caption of held for sale and recognize those assets on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
north tyneside  united kingdom  and heilbronn  germany  facilities we acquired the north tyneside  united kingdom  facility in september  including an interest in acres of land and the fabrication facility of approximately  square feet  for million 
we have the right to acquire title to the land in for a nominal amount 
we sold acres in for million 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the second quarter of to write down the carrying value of equipment in the fabrication facilities in north tyneside  united kingdom  to its estimated fair value  based on management s best estimates considering a number of factors 

table of contents in december  we announced our decision to sell our wafer fabrication facilities in north tyneside  united kingdom  and heilbronn  germany  in an effort to increase manufacturing efficiencies by better utilizing remaining wafer fabrication facilities  while reducing future capital expenditure requirements 
following the announcement of our intention to sell the north tyneside facility in the fourth quarter of  we assessed the fair market value of the facility compared to the carrying value recorded 
the fair value was determined using a market based valuation technique and estimated future cash flows 
we recorded a net impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  related to the write down of long lived assets to their estimated fair values  less costs to dispose of the assets 
we classified assets of the north tyneside facility with a net book value of million excluding cash and inventory  which will not be included in any sale of the facility as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  on october   we entered into definitive agreements to sell certain wafer fabrication equipment and land and buildings at north tyneside to tsmc and highbridge for a total of approximately million 
the disposal group previously classified as held for sale included all assets excluding cash and inventory and liabilities of the north tyneside legal entity 
upon entering into the agreements noted above  we determined that certain equipment and all of the related liabilities were no longer included in the disposal group as they were not being acquired or assumed by the buyer 
as a result  we reassessed whether the assets to be sold in this transaction continued to meet the criteria for classification as held for sale as of september  we concluded that the assets to be sold under the above agreements were no longer available for immediate sale in their present condition as the terms of the these agreements require us to perform significant additional steps  including the dismantling  decommissioning and testing of the wafer fabrication equipment before tsmc will accept transfer of title of the purchased equipment  as well as the delivery of a vacated building to highbridge 
we had previously expected to sell the assets in the form of the transfer of the legal entity and then enter into a further supply agreement for product wafers with the buyer 
however  the agreements noted above require termination of production efforts in order to deliver assets in the condition specified by the buyers 
we have determined that we need to continue to operate the facility in order to build sufficient inventory as a result of the closure of the north tyneside facility  and therefore cannot deliver the assets to be sold in the conditions specified in the sales agreements until production activity is concluded  which occurred in february in accordance with sfas no 
 we determined that the assets to be sold to tsmc and highbridge did not meet the criteria for assets held for sale and were reclassified as held and used  and were measured at the lower of their adjusted carrying amounts or fair values less cost to sell as of december  we received proceeds of million from highbridge for the closing of the real property portion of the transaction in november and a gain on the sale of the real property will be recognized upon us vacating the facility during the second quarter of the gain on the sale of fabrication equipment will be recognized when such equipment is transferred to and accepted by tsmc in the first two quarters of assets removed from the disposal group and expected to be retained were reclassified by us to assets held and used as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 these assets are reported individually at the lower of their respective carrying amount before they were initially classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation amortization expense that would have been recognized had these assets been continuously classified as held and used or the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
as a result of this reclassification  we recorded a credit of million related to the recovery of previous impairment charges recorded for these assets in this credit is included within asset impairment charges recovery in the consolidated statements of operations 
the heilbronn  germany  facility did not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale as of december  and december   due to uncertainties relating to the likelihood of completing the sale within the next twelve months 
long lived assets of this facility at december  and at december   respectively  were classified as held and used 
after an assessment of expected future cash flows generated by the heilbronn  germany facility  we concluded that no impairment existed in the years ended december  and irving  texas  facility we acquired our irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility in january for million plus million in additional costs to retrofit the facility after the purchase 
following significant investment and effort to reach commercial production levels  we decided to close the facility in and it has been idle since then 
since  
table of contents we recorded various impairment charges  including million during the quarter ended december  in the quarter ended december   we performed an assessment of the market value for this facility based on our estimate  which considered a current offer from a willing third party to purchase the facility  among other factors  in determining fair market value 
based on this assessment  an additional impairment charge of million was recorded 
we classified the assets of the irving  texas  facility as held for sale of million during the quarter ended december  the irving facility did not qualify as discontinued operations as it is an idle facility and does not constitute a component of an entity in accordance with sfas no 
on may   we sold our irving  texas  wafer fabrication facility for million in cash million  net of selling costs 
the sale of the facility included acres of land  the fabrication facility building  and related offices  and remaining equipment 
an additional acres of undeveloped land was retained by us and is currently offered for sale 
no significant gain or loss was recorded upon the sale of the facility

concurrent with the sale  we entered into a three year supply agreement with a subsidiary of xbybus sas calling for us to purchase a minimum volume of wafers through fiscal year the supply agreement requires a minimum purchase of million over three years of which million is still required over the remaining term of the agreement as of december  as a result of the significant continuing cash flows relating to this supply agreement  we did not meet the criteria to classify the results of operations of nantes as discontinued operations 
the nantes facility sale occurred in connection with our continuing efforts to consolidate our manufacturing operations  improve gross margins  and reduce operating costs 
legal awards and settlements in  we entered into a license agreement with lm ericsson telefon  ab covering our proprietary avr microprocessor technology 
in november  we filed an arbitration complaint with the international centre for dispute resolution against ericsson and its subsidiary  ericsson mobile platform collectively  ericsson for breach of contract  fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets  among other claims  relating to such technology

ericsson paid the monetary portion of the award on december  interest and other expenses  net interest and other income expenses  net  improved to million of income in the year ended december  from million of expenses in the year ended december  this improvement resulted primarily from reduction to long term debt levels in  as well as a gain from sale of excess land for million recorded in the second quarter of interest and other income expenses  net also improved as a result of reduced losses related to foreign exchange translation 
in  we expect net interest and other income to decline due to reduced cash balances resulting from the million repurchase of common shares as well as higher interest expense resulting from additional borrowings  including the million bank line of credit proceeds received in december interest and other income expenses  net  decreased to million of expense in the year ended december  from million of expense in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily related to lower interest expense resulting from significant debt repayment  including the redemption of the zero coupon convertible notes  due on may   substantially all of the convertible notes outstanding were redeemed for approximately million 
the remaining balance of approximately million was called by atmel in june total debt decreased to million at december  from million at december  interest rates on our outstanding borrowings did not change significantly in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision benefit of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this resulted in an effective tax rate of  and for  and  respectively  expressing tax provision benefit as a percentage of the applicable year s income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income tax expense for totaled million 
the change of million when compared to the income tax expense of million in resulted primarily from the refund of approximately million of foreign r d tax credits 
approximately million of income tax expense in results from taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries which are profitable on a statutory basis for tax purposes and an increase in provision for tax settlements related to certain us federal  state and foreign tax liabilities 
the income tax benefit recorded for resulted primarily from the release of million in tax reserves resulting from the conclusion of an audit in germany for the through tax years and from the expiration of a statute of limitations  partially offset by tax provisions incurred by our profitable foreign subsidiaries

under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained

the income tax returns for our subsidiary in rousset  france for the  and tax years are currently under examination by the french tax authorities 
the examination has resulted in an income tax assessment and we are currently pursuing administrative appeal of the assessment 
in addition  we have a tax audit in progress in a us state and foreign jurisdictions 
while we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  the outcome is subject to uncertainties 
we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations

table of contents discontinued operations grenoble  france  subsidiary sale in july  we completed the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary to ev technologies plc  a british corporation ev 
on august   we received million in cash upon closing million  net of working capital adjustments and costs of disposition 
the grenoble facility was originally acquired in may from thomson csf  and performed the manufacturing of image sensors  as well as analog  digital and radio frequency asics 
technology rights and certain assets related to biometry or finger chip technology were excluded from the sale 
as of july   the facility employed a total of employees  of which employees primarily involved with the finger chip technology were retained  and the remaining employees were transferred to ev 
in connection with the sale  atmel agreed to provide certain technical support  foundry  distribution and other services extending up to four years following the completion of the sale  and in turn ev has agreed to provide certain design and other services to atmel extending up to years following the completion of the sale 
the financial statement impact of these agreements is not expected to be material to us 
the ongoing cash flows between us and ev are not significant and as a result  we have no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the subsidiary 
therefore  we have met the criteria in sfas no 
 which were necessary to classify the grenoble  france  subsidiary as discontinued operations 
included in other currents assets on the consolidated balance sheets is an outstanding receivable balance due from ev of million and million as of december  and  respectively  related to payments advanced to ev to be collected from customers of ev by atmel

we have reduced our debt obligations to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of million 
working capital calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to the repurchase of million in common stock during the year ended december   partially offset by cash provided by operating activities 
approximately million of our investment portfolio at december  is invested in highly rated auction rate securities 
these securities are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of either or days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
we have evaluated our portfolio by continuing to monitor the credit rating and interest yields of these auction rate securities  all of which have had their interest rates successfully reset at each auction date during and through the time of the filing of this form k  except for four failed auctions relating to such securities aggregating approximately million 
as a result of the active liquid market for the trading of all of our auction rate securities portfolio in  we have utilized market prices to ascertain the fair value of the securities at december  we believe that the fair value of our auction rate securities portfolio approximates its par value 
we believe that we have the ability and intent to liquidate these securities in with no significant loss 
no impairment charges were recorded in the year ended december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during the year ended december   resulting primarily from net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense of million and changes in operating assets and liabilities and other net non cash expenses of million 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the year ended december  by approximately million from million in the year ended december  this decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily a result of higher operating costs excluding the impact of depreciation and

should we need to offer longer payment terms in the future due to competitive pressures or longer customer payment patterns  our dso and cash flows from operating activities would be negatively affected 
increases in inventories utilized million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  inventory levels remained constant at days at december   compared to december  inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased specialty wafers  work in process and finished units 
we are continuing to take measures to reduce manufacturing cycle times and improve production planning efficiency 
however  the strategic need to offer competitive lead times may result in an increase in inventory levels in the future 
decreases in current and other assets generated million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   primarily due to payments received for trade receivables advanced to ev technologies plc related to the sale of our grenoble  france  subsidiary  as well as a reduction in vat receivables related to our european operations 
increases in accounts payable generated million of operating cash flows in the year ended december   primarily related to a decrease in capital expenditures and timing of payments 
the accounts payable balance included approximately million related to a grant repayment to the uk government related to the sale and expected closure of our north tyneside  uk manufacturing facility 
we have repaid this amount in the first quarter of decreases in accrued and other liabilities utilized million of operating cash flows in the year ended december  compared to million of cash generated from an increase in accrued and other liabilities in the year ended december  the decrease in accrued liabilities resulted from cash paid for litigation settlements  income and other tax payments  annual management incentive payments and payments on long term supplier obligations 
we do not expect to further significantly reduce accrued and other liabilities in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million provided by investing activities in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we made additional investments in wafer fabrication equipment to advance our process technologies and in test equipment to process higher unit volumes 
for the year ended december  and  we paid million and million  respectively  for capital equipment purchases 
it is anticipated that capital equipment purchases for  estimated at million to million  will be focused on maintaining existing equipment  providing additional testing capacity and  to a limited extent  on developing advanced process technologies 
on may   we sold our irving  tx wafer fabrication facility for proceeds of approximately million million  net of selling costs 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in august  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program asr with third party investment banks and used million to repurchase our common stock 
in the year ended december   we received and retired approximately million shares under the asr arrangement  which reduced our shares outstanding as of december  the entire million was recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet 
we borrowed million against a bank line of credit in the year ended december  however  we continued to pay down other debt  with repayments of principal balances on capital leases and other debt totaling million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in november  we received million for the sale of our north tyneside  uk facility 
the proceeds are 
table of contents classified as a financing obligation until we vacate the facility in the second quarter of proceeds from equipment financing and other debt totaled million for the year ended december  we received million in cash from the issuance of common stock in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  in  substantially all of the convertible notes outstanding were redeemed for approximately million 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents in the year ended december  and due to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances was million and million  respectively 
these cash balances were primarily held in certain subsidiaries in euro denominated accounts and increased in value due to the strengthening of the euro exchange rate compared to the us dollar during these periods 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to generate positive cash flow  however  a significant portion of cash will be used to repay debt and make capital investments 
we expect that we will have sufficient cash from operations and financing sources to meet all debt obligations and other operating needs for at least the next months 
we made million in cash payments for capital equipment in the year ended december  debt obligations outstanding at december   which are classified as short term  totaled million 
in and future years  our capacity to make necessary capital investments will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
on january   we adopted fin under fin  the total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was million on january   of which million was included in accrued and other liabilities  as it was expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
the remainder of our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions of million was included in other long term liabilities 
due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which cash settlement will be made for our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in other long term liabilities 
there were no material changes in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the year ended december  on june   we entered into a year term loan agreement for million with a european bank to finance equipment purchases 
the interest rate on this loan was based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
principal repayments were to be made in equal quarterly installments beginning september  the loan was collateralized by the financed assets and was subject to certain cross default provisions 
we repaid this term loan in the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of assets at our north tyneside facility 
on march   we entered into a five year asset backed credit facility for up to million with certain european lenders 
this facility is secured by our non us trade receivables 
at december   the amount available under this facility was up to approximately million  based on eligible non us trade receivables  of which million was outstanding 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at libor plus per annum approximately at december  while the undrawn portion is subject to a commitment fee of per annum 
the outstanding balance is subject to repayment in full on the last day of its interest period every two months 
the terms of the facility subject us to certain financial and other covenants and cross default provisions 
commitment fees and amortization of up front fees paid related to the facility for the years ended december  and both totaled approximately million  and are included in interest and other income expenses  net  in the consolidated statements of operations

the facility was owned by us since and was comprised of five buildings totaling  square feet  manufacturing bicmos  cmos and non volatile technologies 
the facility employed a total of persons  of which employees were retained by us and the remaining manufacturing employees were transferred to xbybus sas 
concurrent with the sale  we entered into a three year supply agreement with a subsidiary of xbybus sas  whereby we are required to purchase a minimum volume of wafers through the supply agreement requires a minimum purchase of approximately million  of which approximately million is still required over the term of the agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
b this amount relates to the contractual obligation on a supply agreement related to our north tyneside  uk facility 
we plan to terminate this arrangement in due to the announced sale of our north tyneside facility 
our estimated liability upon early termination of this arrangement is million 
c other long term obligations consist principally of future repayments of approximately million of advances from customers  million of technology license payments at present value  and million of cash awards due under executive retention agreements  and million of other long term commitments 
long term advances from customers includes approximately million that is due within year  and has been classified within current liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the balance is due in annual installments of million per year  until repaid in full 
we have agreements with certain employees providing for cash bonuses 
as of december   we have a commitment for future payments of million in bonus and related payroll taxes under these agreements 
d the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities of million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents approximately million of our total debt requires us to meet certain financial ratios and to comply with other covenants on a periodic basis  and they all have cross default provisions 
the financial ratio covenants include  but are not limited to  the maintenance of minimum cash balances and net worth  and debt to capitalization ratios 
there is no requirement to maintain a restricted cash balance 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  we were not in compliance with covenants requiring timely filing of us gaap financial statements as of december   and  as a result  we requested waivers from its lenders to avoid default under these facilities 
waivers were not received from all lenders  and as a result  we had previously classified million of non current liabilities as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as a result of our return to compliance to the related financial and filing requirement covenants in june  these liabilities are classified as non current liabilities as of december  if we need to renegotiate any of these covenants in the future  and the lenders refuse and we are unable to comply with the covenants  then we may immediately be required to repay the loans concerned 
in the event we are required to repay these loans ahead of their due dates  we believe that we have the resources to make such repayments  but such payments could adversely impact our liquidity 
our ability to service long term debt in the us or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amount to us  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
however  the us parent corporation owes much of our consolidated long term debt 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement for the purchase of quantum research group ltd 
quantum  a developer of capacitive sensing ip and solutions for user interfaces 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay approximately million in cash at closing and upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies over the next three years  certain quantum shareholders may also receive up to an additional million in cash and our common stock  the ratio of which will be determined at closing 
the acquisition of quantum is expected to close in the first quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  where shipment represents the point when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we allow certain distributors  primarily based in the united states  rights of return and credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits to these distributors  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
net deferred income for distributor sales was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience  and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
during through  we focused on improving our credit and collection procedures and experienced fewer bad debt write offs 
as a result  the allowance required for doubtful accounts has decreased even though sales levels and related receivable balances have increased 
the amount credited to sg a expense for the year ended december  and  was not material and we credited approximately million to sg a expense for the year ended december  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize 
table of contents deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
atmel s tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis for raw materials and purchased parts  and an average cost basis for work in progress and finished goods or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence 
increases to the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
our inventories include high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management s assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 

table of contents we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  assets held for sale for which depreciation was not being recorded totaled approximately million at december  stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
however  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods do not include the impact of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior periods do not include equity compensation amounts comparable to those included in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and we have elected to adopt fsp no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards to calculate our pool of windfall tax benefits 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
as permitted under sfas no 
and further amended by sfas no 

upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we reassessed our equity compensation valuation method and related assumptions 
our determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and included a combination of payment awards granted prior to january  and payment awards granted subsequent to january  for stock based payment awards granted prior to january   we attribute the value of stock based compensation  determined under sfas no 
r  to expense using the accelerated multiple option approach 
compensation expense for all stock based payment awards granted subsequent to january  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in the years ended december  and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the adoption of sfas no 
r requires us to reflect the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures in the determination of period expense by reversing the previously recognized cumulative compensation expense related to those forfeitures  rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 
we did not record this cumulative impact upon adoption  as the amount was insignificant 
stock options granted in periods prior to were measured based on sfas no 
requirements  whereas stock options granted subsequent to january  were measured based on sfas no 
r requirements 

table of contents restructuring charges we have recorded accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we accrue for losses related to litigation if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include corporate debt securities  us government and municipal agency debt securities  commercial paper  guaranteed variable annuities and auction rate securities 
we monitor our investments for impairment periodically and recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of these investments is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our investments also include certain highly rated auction rate securities  which are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of either or days  and contractual maturities that can be in excess of ten years 
we evaluate our portfolio by continuing to monitor the credit rating  interest yields of these auction rate securities and successful reset at each auction date 
through the time of filing of this form k  we have had four failed auctions relating to such securities aggregating approximately million 
as a result of the active liquid market for the trading of all of our auction rate securities portfolio in  we have utilized market prices to ascertain the fair value of the securities at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our results of operations through december  in addition  some of our borrowings are at floating rates  so this would act as a natural hedge 
we have short term debt  long term debt  capital leases and bank lines of credit totaling million at december  approximately million of these borrowings have fixed interest rates 
we have approximately million of floating interest rate debt  of which approximately million is euro denominated 
we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for our floating rate debt and could be negatively affected should these rates increase significantly 
while there can be no assurance that these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position

conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
in europe  
table of contents where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenues and expenses in euro were approximately and euro to the dollar in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue and an unfavorable impact on operating costs and income from operations since a greater portion of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies than net revenues 
had average exchange rates remained the same during the year ended december  as the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december   our reported revenues for the year ended december  would have been million lower 
however  our foreign currency expenses exceed foreign currency revenues 
for the year ended december   of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
had average exchange rates for the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rates for year ended december   our operating expenses would have been million lower cost of revenues of million  research and development expenses of million  and sales  general and administrative expenses of million 
the net effect resulted in a decrease to income from operations of million in the year ended december  as a result of unfavorable exchange rates when compared to the year ended december  sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively

sales denominated in yen were approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  were approximately  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
liquidity and valuation risk approximately million of our investment portfolio at december  is invested in highly rated auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
if the auctions for the securities we own fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
through the time of filing of this form k  we have had four failed auctions relating to such securities aggregating approximately million 
we believe that the fair value of our auction rate securities portfolio approximates its par value
