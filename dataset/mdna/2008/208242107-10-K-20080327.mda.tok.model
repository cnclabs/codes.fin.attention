all forward looking statements attributable to us  or to persons acting on our behalf  are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of our financial condition and performance in the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 
through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in seven primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast and south texas and oklahoma 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  service maintenance agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account programs  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
the company s management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of the retail stores and considers the credit programs  service contracts and distribution system to be an integral part of the company s retail operations 
on february   we were required to adopt statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
among other things  this statement established a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
additionally  we had the option to choose to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
we elected to early adopt sfas no 
because we believe it provides a more easily understood presentation for financial statement users 
this election resulted in us including all changes in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets in current earnings  in finance charges and other  beginning february  previously  most changes in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets were recorded in other comprehensive income  which was included in stockholders equity 
sfas nos 
and do not allow for retrospective application of these changes in accounting principle  as such  no adjustments have been made to the amounts disclosed in the financial statements for periods ending prior to february  additionally  effective february   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which established a framework for measuring fair value  based on the assumptions we believe market participants would use to value assets or liabilities to be exchanged 
changes in the assumptions over time  including varying credit portfolio performance  market interest rate changes  market participant risk premiums required  or a shift in the mix of funding sources  could result in significant volatility in the fair value of the interest in securitized assets  and thus our earnings 
during the fiscal year ended january   risk premiums required by market participants on many investments increased significantly as a result of disruption in the asset backed securities markets due to increased losses and delinquencies in sub prime real estate mortgages 
though we do not anticipate any significant variation from the current earnings and cash flow performance of our securitized credit portfolio  we increased the risk premium included in the discount rate assumption used in the determination of the fair value of our interests in securitized assets to reflect the higher estimated risk premium we believe a market participant would require if purchasing the asset 
based on a review of the changes in market risk premiums during the fiscal year ended january   and discussions with our investment bankers and financial advisors  we estimated that a market participant would require an approximately basis point increase in the required discount rate risk premium 
as a result  we increased the weighted average discount rate assumption from at january   to at january   after reflecting a basis point decrease in the risk free interest rate included in the discount rate assumption 
we have also included an expected market participant based assumption related to the estimated cost of a bond issuance contemplated by the qspe  and an increase in the credit loss rate on the credit portfolio we estimate a market participant would use in determining the fair value of our interests in securitized assets 
the increase in the discount rate has the effect of deferring income to future periods  but not permanently reducing securitization income or our earnings 
if a market participant were to require a risk premium that is basis points higher than we estimated in the fair value calculation  the fair value of our interests in securitized assets would be decreased by an additional million 
if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates or reductions in rates charged on the accounts transferred  our interest in securitized assets and finance charges and other would have been reduced by million as of january  if the assumption used for estimating credit losses was increased by  the impact to finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  we understand that risk premiums and borrowing costs have continued to increase since january   and could result in a significant adjustment to the fair value of our interests in securitized assets in future periods 
we were also required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  effective on february  as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement  along with the requirements of sfas no 
 we recorded a million servicing liability on the balance sheet in deferred revenues and allowances 
any changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in the period of change in the statement of operations in finance charges and other 
as with the other changes discussed above  no adjustments have been made to the financial statements for periods ending prior to february  presented below is a diagram setting forth our five cornerstones which represent  in our view  the five components of our sales goal strong merchandising systems  flexible credit options for our customers  an extensive warehousing and distribution system  a service system to support our customers needs during and beyond the product warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
each of these systems is discussed at length in the business section of this report 
business cornerstones merchandising credit distribution drive sales service training we  of course  derive a large part of our revenue from our product sales 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through these programs 
in turn  we finance convert to cash substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through an asset backed securitization facility 
see business finance operations for a detailed discussion of our in house credit programs 
as part of our asset backed securitization facility  we have created a qualifying special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes serviced by the receivables to finance its acquisition of the receivables 
we transfer our receivables  consisting of retail installment and revolving account receivables extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated securities 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to the products they have purchased  to the extent they do not already have it 
executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the prior year is included beginning under results of operations 
following are significant financial items in managements view o our revenues for the fiscal year ended january   increased by percent  or million  from fiscal year  to million due primarily to product sales growth which drove higher service maintenance agreement commissions and finance charge and other revenues 
our same store sales growth rate for the fiscal year ended january   was  versus for fiscal o the addition of stores in our existing dallas fort worth  houston  san antonio and south texas markets and our first store in oklahoma had a positive impact on our revenues 
we achieved approximately million of increases in product sales and service maintenance agreement sma commissions for the year ended january   from the opening of thirteen new stores in these markets since february our plans provide for the opening of seven to ten additional stores  primarily in existing markets  and expand our presence in oklahoma  during fiscal as we focus on opportunities in markets in which we have existing infrastructure 
o deferred interest and same as cash plans continue to be an important part of our sales promotion plans and are utilized to provide a wide variety of financing to enable us to appeal to a broader customer base 
for the fiscal year ended january   million  or  of our product sales were financed by deferred interest and same as cash plans 
this volume of promotional credit as a percent of product sales is consistent with our use of this type of credit product before the hurricanes in late for the comparable period in the prior year  product sales financed by deferred interest and same as cash sales were million  or 
our promotional credit programs same as cash and deferred interest programs  which require monthly payments  are reserved for our highest credit quality customers  thereby reducing the overall risk in the portfolio  and are used primarily to finance sales of our highest margin products 
we expect to continue to offer extended term promotional credit in the future 
o our gross margin was for fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million reduction in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets and reduced gross margin realized on product sales from in the year ended january   to in fiscal year excluding the decrease in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets we would have achieved a gross margin 
o our operating margin decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal  primarily as a result of the million decrease in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets 
excluding the decrease in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets  we would have achieved a operating margin 
in fiscal year  sg a expense as a percent of revenues increased to from when compared to the prior year  primarily from increases in payroll and payroll related expenses 
o cash flows used in operations was million during fiscal due primarily to increased investment in credit portfolio growth and increased investment in inventory due to the timing of receipts of inventory 
o our pretax income for fiscal decreased by or approximately million  from fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was driven by million non cash reduction in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued increased focus on  or modified several initiatives in fiscal that we believe will positively impact our future operating results  including o increased promotion of flat panel technology in our stores as the price point becomes more affordable for our customers  and o increased emphasis on the sale of small electronics  including video game equipment and gps devices  and o increased emphasis on the sales of furniture  and additional product lines added to this category  and o a thorough review of our staffing and cost structure to ensure we are effectively leveraging the infrastructure in place and that it is sufficient to support our growth plans 
while the hurricanes that hit the gulf coast on august and september of impacted our customer s ability to pay on their accounts  its biggest impact was the disruption to our credit collection operations  including payment processing delays caused by disruption in the mail service 
the credit collection operations were negatively affected by the loss of personnel  as some employees did not return to work  and by the increase in the number of delinquent accounts  resulting in increased workloads for the personnel that returned to work 
to address the staffing issues caused by the disruption we saw after hurricane rita that hit the gulf coast during september of  we intensified our recruiting efforts to attract individuals to our beaumont  texas collection center 
further  during  we opened a second collection center in san antonio  texas and closed our collection center in dallas  texas 
we identified and have been successful in recruiting highly qualified  bi lingual credit collectors in the san antonio market that we were not able to recruit in sufficient numbers in dallas 
additionally  non storm factors that may be negatively affecting delinquencies and charge offs include the impact of the bankruptcy law change in october and other economic factors on our customers  including the impact of rising interest rates on sub prime mortgages 
in addition to opening the san antonio collection center  we have reorganized the management team over our credit operations to achieve a flatter organization to put key managers closer to the customer 
as a result of the changes made  we have been successful in reducing delinquencies and expect to maintain net credit losses around 
on may   the governor of texas signed a tax bill that modifies the existing franchise tax  with the most significant change being the replacement of the existing base with a tax based on margin 
taxable margin is generally defined as total federal tax revenues minus the greater of a cost of goods sold or b compensation 
the tax rate to be paid by retailers and wholesalers is on taxable margin 
this will result in an increase in taxes paid by us  as franchise taxes paid totaled less than  per year for the years prior to fiscal during june  we completed a reorganization to simplify our legal entity structure by merging certain of our texas limited partnerships into their corporate partners 
the reorganization also resulted in the one time elimination of the texas margin tax owed by those partnerships  representing virtually all of the margin tax owed by us 
accordingly  we reversed approximately million of accrued texas margin tax as of june  net of federal income tax 
we began accruing the margin tax for the entities that acquired the operations through the mergers in july going forward  we expect our effective tax rate on income before income taxes to increase to between and  from the we experienced prior to the initiation of the new tax 
during the year  we opened one new store in the houston market  three in the dallas fort worth market  one in san antonio  texas  one in brownsville  texas and one in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the dallas fort worth market continues to perform at the mid point of our range of expectations and we believe we have significant upside potential in that market through growth in the existing stores and our intention to continue to expand the number of stores in that market 
we have several other locations in texas  louisiana and oklahoma that we believe are promising and are in various stages of development for opening in fiscal year we also continue to look at other markets  including neighboring states for opportunities 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive same store sales increases 
typically  these new products  such as lcd  plasma and dlp televisions  dvd players  digital cameras  gps devices and mp players are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes more mainstream 
to sustain positive same store sales growth  unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices 
the affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth 
however  as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry  which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase  combined with rapid price erosion in the industry  retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales 
this has historically been our experience  and we continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as of january  transfers of financial assets 
we transfer customer receivables to a qspe that issues asset backed securities to third party lenders using these accounts as collateral  and we continue to service these accounts after the transfer 
we recognize the sale of these accounts when we relinquish control of the transferred financial asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
as we transfer the accounts we record an asset representing our interest in the cash flows of the qspe  which is the difference between the interest earned on customer accounts and the cost associated with financing and servicing the transferred accounts  including a provision for bad debts associated with the transferred accounts  plus our retained interest in the transferred receivables  discounted using a return that would be expected by a third party investor 
we recognize the income from our interest in these transferred accounts as gains on the transfer of the asset  interest income and servicing fees 
this income is recorded as finance charges and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
on february   we were required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
among other things  this statement establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
additionally  we had the option to choose to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
essentially  we had to decide between bifurcation of the embedded derivative and the fair value option in determining how we would account for our interests in securitized assets 
we elected to early adopt sfas no 
because we believe it provides a more easily understood presentation for financial statement users 
historically  we had valued and reported our interests in securitized assets at fair value  though most changes in the fair value were recorded in other comprehensive income 
the fair value option simplifies the treatment of changes in the fair value of the asset  by reflecting all changes in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets in current earnings  in finance charges and other  beginning february  sfas nos 
and do not allow for retrospective application of these changes in accounting principle and  as such  no adjustments have been made to the amounts disclosed in the financial statements for periods ending prior to february  however  the balance in other comprehensive income  as of january   of million  which represented unrecognized gains on the fair value of the interests in securitized assets  was included in a cumulative effect adjustment that was recorded in retained earnings  effective february  because of our adoption of sfas no 
 effective february   we were required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a framework for measuring fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we estimate the fair value of our interests in securitized assets using a discounted cash flow model with most of the inputs used being unobservable inputs 
the primary unobservable inputs  which are derived principally from our historical experience  with input from our investment bankers and financial advisors  include the estimated portfolio yield  credit loss rate  discount rate  payment rate and delinquency rate and reflect our judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value 
in determining the cost of borrowings  we use current actual borrowing rates  and adjusts them  as appropriate  using interest rate futures data from market sources to project interest rates over time 
changes in the assumptions over time  including varying credit portfolio performance  market interest rate changes  market participant risk premiums required  or a shift in the mix of funding sources  could result in significant volatility in the fair value of the interest in securitized assets  and thus our earnings 
additionally  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  effective february   we record all changes in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets in current earnings  in finance charges and other 
previously  most changes in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets were recorded in other comprehensive income 
effective february   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which established a framework for measuring fair value  based on the assumptions a company believes market participants would use to value assets or liabilities to be exchanged 
the gain or loss recognized on the sales of the receivables is based on our best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves  costs of servicing the accounts and appropriate discount rates  based on our expectations of the assumptions that a market participant would use 
we were required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  effective on february  as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement we recorded a servicing liability on the balance sheet in deferred revenues and allowances and any changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded in the period of change in the statement of operations in finance charges and other 
we estimate the fair value of our servicing liability using the portfolio performance and discount rate assumptions discussed above  and an estimate of the servicing fee a market participant would require to service the portfolio 
the use of different estimates or assumptions in the valuation of our interest in securitized assets or servicing liability could produce different financial results 
additionally  changes in the assumptions over time  including varying credit portfolio performance  market interest rate changes or risk premiums required  or a shift in the mix of funding sources  could result in significant volatility in the fair value of the interests in securitized assets  and thus our earnings 
during the fiscal year ended january   risk premiums required by market participants on many investments increased significantly as a result of disruption in the asset backed securities markets due to increased losses and delinquencies in sub prime mortgages 
though we do not anticipate any significant variation from the current earnings and cash flow performance of our securitized credit portfolio  we increased the risk premium included in the discount rate assumption used in the determination of the fair value of our interests in securitized assets to reflect the higher expected risk premiums included in investment returns we believe a market participant would require if purchasing our interests 
based on a review of the changes in market risk premiums during the fiscal year ended january   and discussions with our investment bankers and financial advisors  we estimated that a market participant would require an approximately basis point increase in the required risk premium 
as a result  the company increased the weighted average discount rate assumption from at january   to at january   after reflecting a basis point decrease in the risk free interest rate included in the discount rate assumption 
we have also included an expected market participant based assumption related to the estimated cost of a bond issuance contemplated by the qspe  and an increase in the credit loss rate on the credit portfolio we estimate a market participant would use in determining the fair value of our interests in securitized assets 
the increase in the discount rate has the effect of deferring income to future periods  but not permanently reducing securitization income or our earnings 
if a market participant were to require a risk premium that is basis points higher than we estimated in the fair value calculation  the fair value of our interests in securitized assets would be decreased by an additional million 
if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates or reductions in rates charged on the accounts transferred  our interest in securitized assets and finance charges and other would have been reduced by million as of january  if the assumption used for estimating credit losses was increased by  the impact to finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services 
we sell service maintenance agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligor on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
when we sell service maintenance agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the service maintenance agreement 
these direct obligor service maintenance agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts and typically range from months to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing and training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost or advertising expense according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  if the programs are related to promotion or marketing of the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal year ended january   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  represented advertising assistance allowances 
share based compensation 
in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
under the requirements of this statement we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  typically stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award  and record that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value is based on our best estimate of key assumptions  including expected time period over which the options will remain outstanding and expected stock price volatility at the date of grant 
additionally  we must estimate expected forfeitures for each stock option grant and adjust the recorded compensation expense accordingly 
the use of different estimates could produce different financial results 
see notes and to our financial statements for additional information 
accounting for leases 
the accounting for leases is governed primarily by sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
as required by the standard  we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets

these changes are discussed in the executive overview  and in more detail in the discussion of operating results beginning in the analysis below 
same store sales growth is calculated by comparing the reported sales by store for all stores that were open throughout a period to reported sales by store for all stores that were open throughout the prior year period 
sales from closed stores have been removed from each period 
sales from relocated stores have been included in each period because each store was relocated within the same general geographic market 
sales from expanded stores have been included in each period 
the presentation of our gross margins may not be comparable to other retailers since we include the cost of our in home delivery service as part of selling  general and administrative expense 
similarly  we include the cost of merchandising our products  including amounts related to purchasing the product in selling  general and administrative expense 
it is our understanding that other retailers may include such costs as part of cost of goods sold

the million increase in net sales was made up of the following o a million increase resulted from a same store sales increase of 
o a million increase generated by thirteen retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period  o a million decrease resulted from an increase in discounts on promotional credit sales  and o a million increase resulted from an increase in service revenues 
the components of the million increase in net sales were a million increase in product sales and an million net increase in service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million increase in product sales resulted from the following o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales  due primarily to increased consumer electronics especially flat panel televisions and furniture sales  partially offset by a decline in appliance and track sales  and o approximately million was attributable to an overall increase in the average unit price 
the increase was driven primarily by a change in the mix of product sales  as consumer electronics  which has the highest average price  became a larger share of our total product sales and was partially offset by the million increase in discounts on extended term promotional credit sales

while the industry is down nationally  we expect to outperform the national trend and are taking steps to improve our performance relative to merchandising  advertising and promotion of this category 
additionally  we experienced higher than normal demand for these products in the prior year due to consumers replacing appliances after hurricanes katrina and rita  especially during the first three months of the period 
this increase is due to increased unit volume in the area of flat panel televisions  partially offset by a decline in the sale of tube and projection televisions 
the increase in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by increased laptop computer and video game equipment sales and was partially offset by reduced sales of portable electronics  including camcorders  digital cameras and portable crt televisions 
this increase was due to an increase in the delivery fee charged to our customers  as the total number of deliveries declined slightly as compared to the prior year 
this category benefited from a high level of rainfall in the current year and an increase in sales of higher priced lawn and garden equipment  such as zero turn radius mowers and tractors 
this decrease is due to the impact of our change in strategy as we move to a multi vendor relationship 
this increase is due to the increased emphasis on the sales of furniture  primarily sofas  recliners and entertainment centers  and new products added to this category 
this increase is due to the increase in product sales  increased sales penetration and decreased sma cancellations as credit charge offs declined as compared to the prior year period 
this increase is driven by increased units in operation as we continue to grow product sales and an increase in the cost of parts used to repair higher priced technology flat panel televisions  etc finance charges and other increased due primarily to an increase in securitization income of million  or and an increase in insurance commissions of million  and a decrease in other items of million 
the securitization income  which grew due to growth in the portfolio and lower net credit losses on receivables transferred to the qspe  was negatively impacted by a non cash  decrease in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets 
the non cash fair value adjustment of million was recorded primarily as a result of the recent turmoil in the financial markets 
we increased the risk premium included in the discount rate assumption in the determination of the fair value of our interests in securitized assets based on our estimate of the risk premium we believe a market participant would require if they purchased our interests in securitized assets 
additionally  we increased the loss rate and borrowing cost assumptions we believe a market participant would use in determining the fair value of our interest in securitized assets see note to the financial statements for additional information 
the securitization income comparison was impacted by a million impairment charge recorded in the prior year for higher projected credit losses due to the impact in the prior year of hurricane rita on our credit collection operations and increased bankruptcy filings due to the new bankruptcy laws that took effect in october our net credit loss rate of for the year ended january   was in line with our expected long term net loss rate of between and 
insurance commissions increased primarily due to increased sales and reduced insurance cancellations as credit charge offs declined from the prior year period

additionally  the effective tax rate declined from for the year ended january   to for the year ended january  the decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to the reversal of previously accrued texas margin tax as a result of the legal entity reorganization completed during the three months ended july  in july  we began accruing margin tax for the entities that acquired the operations through the mergers completed during the quarter

the million increase in net sales was made up of the following o a million increase resulted from a same store sales increase of 
the fiscal growth rate was impacted as a result of being compared to the very strong  hurricane impacted prior year sales  which resulted in a same store sales growth rate of achieved in the year ended january  o a million increase generated by twelve retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period  o a million decrease resulted from an increase in discounts on promotional credit sales  and o a million increase resulted from an increase in service revenues 
the components of the million increase in net sales were a million increase in product sales and an million net increase in service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million increase in product sales resulted from the following o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales  due primarily to increased appliances  consumer electronics especially lcd  plasma and dlp televisions and furniture sales  partially offset by a decline in track sales  and o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit price points 
the price point impact was driven primarily by consumers selecting higher priced appliance products  including high efficiency washers and dryers and stainless steel kitchen appliances and increased delivery fees  partially offset by a decline in consumer electronics as prices for new technology erode and the million increase in discounts on extended term promotional credit sales

fiscal year appliance sales were benefited by strong customer demand after hurricanes katrina and rita in that year 
these increases are consistent with overall increase in product sales and improved unit prices 
the decline in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  portable electronics and small appliances is due primarily to reduced sales of computers and portable crt televisions 
a slower late summer selling season due to dry weather impacted this category 
this increase is due to the increased emphasis on the sales of mattresses and furniture  primarily sofas  recliners and entertainment centers  and new product lines added to the furniture category 
this decrease is due to increased sma cancellations driven by higher credit charge offs and reduced sales penetration as we introduced products furniture and mattresses that are not sma eligible 
this increase is driven by increased units in operation as we continue to grow product sales and an increase in the prices of parts used to repair higher priced technology flat panel televisions  etc this increase in revenue resulted primarily from increases in securitization income of million  a million decrease in service maintenance agreement retrospective commissions and a net increase in insurance commissions and other revenues of million 
securitization income grew at a slower pace than net sales because of higher credit losses experienced during the year ended january   as a result of the disruption to our credit operations caused by hurricane rita 
as a result of the higher loss rate experienced  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended july   reducing the value of our interest in securitized assets 
the credit net charge off rate has returned to historical levels and is expected to approximate during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million during the quarter ended october   for anticipated credit losses due to the impact of hurricane rita on our credit operations and an increase in bankruptcy filings due to the new bankruptcy law that took effect in october securitization income growth is attributable to higher product sales and increases in our retained interest in assets transferred to the qspe  due primarily to increases in the transferred balances 
insurance commissions and other revenue growth was driven by the increase in product sales the decline in service maintenance agreement retrospective commissions was due to a change in the commission structure that became effective during fiscal the change resulted in us receiving a greater portion of the income at the time of the sale of the service maintenance agreement  which is included in total net sales  with a corresponding decrease in the retrospective commissions received

the decrease in the provision for income taxes is attributable to lower income before income taxes  state tax refunds received during the period and adjustments to reconcile final tax returns to previous estimates  partially offset by additional tax expense from the new texas margin tax 
the impact of the new texas margin tax was partially offset by the one time benefit of deferred tax assets recorded as a result of the new tax 
our effective rate for the year ended january  was  as compared to for the year ended january   as impact of the texas margin tax was partially offset by the refunds and return adjustments 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  a continuing significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 
seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january  due primarily to the holiday selling season 
over the four quarters of fiscal  gross margins were   and 
during the same period  operating margins were   and 
a portion of the fluctuation in gross margins and operating margins is due to planned infrastructure cost additions  such as increased warehouse space and larger stores  additional personnel and systems required to absorb the significant increase in revenues that we have experienced over the last several years 
we also recorded a reduction in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets by million in the quarter ended october   which caused both the gross margin and operating margin for that quarter to be reduced 
additionally  quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following o timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  o sales contributed by new stores  o increases or decreases in comparable store sales  o adverse weather conditions  o shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  and o changes in our merchandise mix 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year

liquidity and capital resources we require capital to finance our growth as we add new stores and markets to our operations  which in turn requires additional working capital for increased receivables and inventory 
we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of receivables to our asset backed securitization facilities 
at january   we had a revolving lines of credit in the amount of million  under which we had no borrowings outstanding  but utilized million of availability to issue letters of credit 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including those for our capital expenditure requirements  will be met with our available lines of credit and our million of excess cash and cash equivalents  which were invested in short term  tax free instruments  at january   together with cash generated from operations 
our current plans are to grow our store base by approximately a year 
we expect we will invest in inventory  real estate and customer receivables to support the additional stores and same store sales growth 
depending on market conditions we may  at times  enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance our real estate or seek alternative financing sources for new store expansions and customer receivables growth  including expansion of existing lines of credit  and accessing new debt or equity markets 
on march   we executed an amendment to our bank credit facility  to increase the commitment from million to million  to provide additional liquidity  if needed  to support our growth plans 
in addition to the expanded commitment  the interest margin added to the applicable base rate was increased by basis points 
this facility matures in november this increase in the facility brings our total availability under revolving lines of credit to million at march  in its regularly scheduled meeting on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  dependent on market conditions and the price of the stock 
we expect to fund these purchases with a combination of excess cash  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of owned properties 
through january   we had spent million under this authorization to acquire  shares of our common stock 
future stock repurchases will be dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to support our growth plans and the repurchase program 
the following is a comparison of our statement of cash flows for our fiscal years and during the year ended january   net cash provided by used in operating activities decreased million from million provided by operating activities in the year ended january   to million used in the january  operating cash flows for both periods were negatively impacted by higher than normal payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses  as discussed below 
the cash used in operations for the year ended january   was driven primarily by payments on accounts payable  which was driven by the timing of receipts of inventory and increased investment in accounts receivable 
our increased investment in accounts receivable was due primarily to increased balances in the sold portfolio and a lower funding rate as a percentage of the sold portfolio 
the lower funding rate is primarily the result of the qspe s pay down of its series b bond issuance 
we expect the funding rate to improve once the pay down is completed  which is scheduled for completion in may  the cash provided by operations for the year ended january   resulted primarily from net income plus depreciation plus the benefit of the qspe completing its medium term bond issuance in august the completion of the bond issuance resulted in an increase in the funding rate  providing additional cash to be advanced to us on receivables transferred 
offsetting the cash provided was cash used primarily due to increased investment in inventory and the timing of payments of accounts payable and federal income and employment taxes  which had been extended due to the impact of hurricanes in the prior fiscal year 
those extended terms ended and deadlines were reached in the quarter ended april   and we were required to satisfy those obligations  negatively impacting our operating cash flows by approximately million 
as noted above  we offer promotional credit programs to certain customers that provide for same as cash or deferred interest interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six  or months  in fiscal year we increased these terms to include  and months 
the various same as cash promotional accounts and deferred interest program accounts are eligible for securitization up to the limits provided for in our securitization agreements 
this limit is currently of eligible securitized receivables 
if we exceed this limit  we would be required to use some of our other capital resources to carry the unfunded balances of the receivables for the promotional period 
the percentage of eligible securitized receivables represented by promotional receivables was as of january   and at january   the percentage was the weighted average promotional period was months and months for promotional receivables outstanding as of january  and  respectively 
the weighted average remaining term on those same promotional receivables was months and months as of january  and  respectively 
while overall these promotional receivables have a much shorter weighted average term than non promotional receivables for the customers that take advantage of the promotional terms  we receive less income on these receivables  resulting in a reduction of the net interest margin used in the calculation of the gain on the sale of receivables 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
cash used for purchases of property and equipment was approximately million in fiscal year and fiscal year the cash expended for property and equipment was used primarily for construction of new stores and the reformatting of existing stores to better support our current product mix 
we estimate that capital expenditures for the fiscal year will approximate million to million 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but does not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership if it meets our cash investment strategy 
net cash used in financing activities increased million from million for the year ended january   to million for the year ended january  this change resulted primarily from the use of million for the purchase of our common stock in fiscal year we entered into our existing bank credit facility on october  the agreement provides a line of credit to million  with an accordion feature to allow further expansion of the facility to million  under certain conditions 
the credit facility has a maturity date of november  additionally  the facility provides sublimits of million for a swingline line of credit for faster advances on borrowing requests  and million for standby letters of credit 
loans under our revolving credit facility may  at our option  bear interest at either the alternate base rate  which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate  or the libor rate for the applicable interest period  in each case plus an applicable interest margin 
the interest margin is between and for base rate loans and between and for libor alternative rate loans 
the interest margin will vary depending on our debt coverage ratio 
additionally we pay commitment fees for the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility 
at january   based on the libor rate  the interest rate on the revolving facility was 
effective august   we entered into an amendment to our million revolving credit facility with the existing lenders 
the amendment increases our restricted payment capacity  which includes payments for repurchases of capital stock  from million to million 
there were no other modifications of the credit agreement

events of default under the credit facility include  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain judgments and other liabilities  certain environmental claims  and a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions  including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets  excluding customer receivables owned by the qspe and certain inventory subject to vendor floor plan arrangements

there was million of letters of credit issued at january  included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  we created a qspe in to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes secured by the receivables to third parties to finance its purchase of these receivables 
we transfer receivables  consisting of retail installment and revolving accounts receivables extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash  subordinated securities and the right to receive the interest spread between the assets held by the qspe and the notes issued to third parties and our servicing fees 
the subordinated securities issued to us accrue interest based on prime rates and are subordinate to these third party notes 
both the bank credit facility and the asset backed securitization program are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our continued growth 
funding of current and future receivables under the asset backed securitization program can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible receivable amounts 
if the funding under the asset backed securitization program were reduced or terminated  we would have to draw down our bank credit facility more quickly than we have estimated 
a summary of the total receivables managed under the credit portfolio  including quantitative information about delinquencies  net credit losses and components of securitized assets  is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
based on current operating plans  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  available borrowings under our credit facility  access to the unfunded portion of the variable funding portion of our asset backed securitization program and our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital expenditure programs for at least the next months 
however  there are several factors that could decrease cash provided by operating activities  including o reduced demand or margins for our products  o more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  o loss of ability to acquire inventory on consignment  o increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  o reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  o changes in inventory requirements based on longer delivery times of the manufacturers or other requirements which would negatively impact our delivery and distribution capabilities  o increases in the retained portion of our receivables portfolio under our current qspe s asset backed securitization program as a result of changes in performance or types of receivables transferred promotional versus non promotional  or as a result of a change in the mix of funding sources available to the qspe  requiring higher collateral levels  o inability to renew or expand our capacity for financing our receivables portfolio under existing or replacement qspe asset backed securitization programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  o increases in the program costs interest and administrative fees relative to our receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our receivables  o increases in personnel costs required for us to stay competitive in our markets  and o the inability to get our current variable funding facility renewed 
if cash provided by operating activities during this period is less than we expect or if we need additional financing for future growth  we may need to increase our revolving credit facility or undertake additional equity or debt offerings 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet financing arrangements since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  we have created a qualified special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue asset backed and variable funding notes to third parties to obtain cash for these purchases 
we transfer receivables with a weighted average life of years  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated  unsecured promissory notes 
to finance its acquisition of these receivables  the issuer has issued the notes and bonds described below to third parties 
the unsecured promissory notes issued to us are subordinate to these third party notes and bonds 
at january   the issuer has issued three series of notes the series a variable funding note with a total availability of million  three classes of series b notes in the aggregate amount outstanding of million  of which million was required to be placed in a restricted cash account for the benefit of the bondholders  and three classes of series a bonds with an aggregate amount outstanding of million  of which million was required to be placed in a restricted cash account for the benefit of the bondholders 
the series a variable funding note is composed of a million day tranche  and a million tranche that matures in the day commitment was recently renewed and increased  in the amount of million  by the note holders until july  the million increase in the commitment will stay in place until the first to occur of i the qspe completes a medium term bond issuance  or ii the note is not renewed by the note holders 
at the time of the increase in the note  an additional bank joined as the second note holder in the facility 
the commercial paper underlying the series a variable funding note is rated a p by standard and poors and moody s  respectively 
these ratings represent the highest rating highest quality of each rating agency s three short term investment grade ratings  except that standard and poors could add a which would convert the highest quality rating to an extremely strong rating 
the series b notes consist of class a notes in the amount million  rated aaa by moody s representing the highest rating highest quality of the four long term investment grade ratings provided by this organization  class b notes in the amount million  rated a by moody s representing the middle of the third rating upper medium quality of the four long term investment grade ratings provided by this organization  and class c notes in the amount of million  rated baa bbb by moody s and fitch  respectively

the ratings disclosed are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
these ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time without notice  and each of the ratings should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we are not aware of a rating by any other rating organization and are not aware of any changes in these ratings 
private institutional investors  primarily insurance companies  purchased the series b notes and series a notes 
the issuer used the proceeds of these issuances to purchase eligible accounts receivable from us and to fund the required restricted cash accounts for credit enhancement of the notes 
if the net portfolio yield  as defined by agreements  falls below  then the issuer may be required to fund additions to the cash reserves in the restricted cash accounts 
at january  the net portfolio yield was in compliance with this requirement 
we are entitled to a monthly servicing fee  so long as we act as servicer  in an amount equal to 
multiplied by the average aggregate principal amount of receivables plus the amount of average aggregate defaulted receivables 
the issuer records revenues equal to the interest charged to the customer on the receivables less losses  the cost of funds  the program administration fees paid in connection with the series a  series b  or series a note holders  the servicing fee and additional earnings to the extent they are available 
after the september   amendment  the series a variable funding note now permits the issuer to borrow funds up to million to purchase receivables from us  thereby functioning as a basket to accumulate receivables 
as issuer borrowings under the series a variable funding note approach million  the issuer is required to request an increase in the series a amount or issue a new series of bonds and use the proceeds to pay down the then outstanding balance of the series a variable funding note  so that the basket will once again become available to accumulate new receivables or meet other obligations required under the transaction documents 
as of january   borrowings under the series a variable funding note were million 
recent turmoil in the financial markets  especially with respect to asset backed securities  has resulted in reduced liquidity available for issuances of these securities and rising costs for issuers 
as a result  the issuer has delayed the marketing of an additional series of fixed rate bonds 
it is currently anticipated that the issuer will attempt to complete a transaction in the second or third quarter of the fiscal year ending january   but no assurance can be given that a transaction can be completed on terms favorable to it 
the proceeds of a new issuance would provide the issuer additional capacity for the purchase of our receivables 
if the issuer is unable to complete the new bond issuance or renew or increase the total availability under the series a variable funding note  then  after its current funding sources are exhausted  we may have to fund growth in the receivables portfolio until the issuer can obtain additional funding 
if necessary  in addition to available cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities  additional cash to fund our growth and increase receivables balances could be obtained by o reducing capital expenditures for new store openings  o taking advantage of longer payment terms and financing available for inventory purchases  o utilizing other sources for providing financing to our customers  o negotiating to expand the capacity available under existing credit facilities  and o accessing new debt or equity markets 
at january   we had million of excess cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facilities  among other liquidity sources  to provide funding  if needed  to fund receivable portfolio growth 
as such  we believe we have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our operations  including credit portfolio growth  for at least the next months 
the series a variable funding note bears interest at the commercial paper rate plus an applicable margin  in most instances of 
the series b notes have fixed rates of  and for the class a  b and c notes  respectively 
the series a notes have fixed rates of  and for the class a  b and c notes  respectively 
in addition  there is an annual administrative fee and a non use fee associated with the unused portion of the committed facility 
while we are not directly liable to the lenders under the asset backed securitization facility  any shortfall in the cash necessary to repay the note and bond holders and our subordinated notes would first reduce the amount paid to us under the subordinated notes 
as such  we bear the risk of losses incurred by the issuer  to the extent of our retained interest  before the issuer s third party lenders are exposed to losses

interest rates under our bank credit facility are variable and are determined  at our option  as the base rate  which is the greater of prime rate or federal funds rate plus plus the base rate margin  which ranges from to  or libor plus the libor margin  which ranges from to 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor  which are affected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  our bank credit facility 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our interest in securitized assets
