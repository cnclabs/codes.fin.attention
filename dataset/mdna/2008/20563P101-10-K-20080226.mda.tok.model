security products furniture components marine components mauldin  sc grayslake  il kitchener  ontario byron center  mi taipei  taiwan neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are zinc used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  coiled steel used in the furniture components segment for the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems  stainless steel used in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components  and plastic resins used primarily in the furniture components segment for injection molded plastics in the manufacturer of ergonomic computer support systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified purchase volumes 
we utilize purchase arrangements to stabilize our raw material prices provided we meet the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities 
raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover all increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by raw material cost pressures 
steel and zinc prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends and specific developments in consuming industries and are currently at historically high levels 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names include furniture components security products marine components compx precision slides compx security products custom marine compx waterloo national cabinet lock livorsi marine compx ergonomx fort lock cmi industrial mufflers compx durislide timberline custom marine stainless dynaslide chicago lock exhaust waterloo furniture stock locks the choice in components limited keset performance boating tubar mega rim ace ii race rim compx marine sales  marketing and distribution 
we sell components directly to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals and engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturers representatives 
we select manufacturers representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
a significant portion of our sales are also made through distributors 
we have a significant market share of cabinet lock sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 
due to our success with the stock locks inventory program within the security products segment  similar programs have been implemented for distributor sales of ergonomic computer support systems within the furniture components segment 
in  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total sales  however  no one customer accounted for sales of or more in of the  was related to security products and was related to furniture components 
overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are valued by the customer 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
our security products and furniture components segments compete against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
suppliers  particularly asian based furniture component suppliers  have put intense price pressure on our products 
in some cases  we have lost sales to these lower cost manufacturers 
we have responded by shifting the manufacture of some products to our lower cost facilities  working to reduce costs and gain operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and lean process improvements in all of our facilities  and by working with our customers to be their value added supplier of choice by offering customer support services which asian based suppliers are generally unable to provide 
international operations we have substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally furniture component operations in canada and taiwan 
the majority of our non us sales are to customers located in canada 
these operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss 
we do not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
we cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on our operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
employees as of december   we employed the following number of people united states canada taiwan total approximately of our canadian employees are represented by a labor union covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in january which provides for annual wage increases from to over the term of the contract

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs 
many of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design  quality and durability to the customer 
however  our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs  especially those sourced from asia 
competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products 
our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
our ability to adjust costs relative to our pricing 
customers may no longer value our product design  quality or durability over lower cost 
sales for certain precision slides and ergonomic products are concentrated in the office furniture industry  which has periodically experienced significant reductions in demand that could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
sales of our products to the office furniture manufacturing industry accounted for approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the future growth  if any  of the office furniture industry will be affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors  such as service industry employment levels  corporate cash flows and non residential commercial construction  as well as industry factors such as corporate reengineering and restructuring  technology demands  ergonomic  health and safety concerns and corporate relocations 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not materially and adversely affect our business 
our failure to enter into new markets with our current businesses would result in the continued significant impact of fluctuations in demand within the office furniture manufacturing industry on our operating results 
in an effort to reduce our dependence on the office furniture market for certain products and to increase our participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to identifying new customers and developing new applications for those products in markets outside of the office furniture industry  such as home appliances and tool boxes 
developing these new applications for our products involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to our limited experience with customers and applications in these markets as well as facing competitors who are already established in these markets 
we may not be successful in developing new customers or applications for our products outside of the office furniture industry 
significant time may be required to develop new applications and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our development of new products as well as innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
the introduction of new products and features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of the new products with current and potential customers 
the ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new products that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new products we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new products typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials 
as we attempt to introduce new products in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
recent and future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks 
a key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through acquisitions 
our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks  including the identification of suitable growth opportunities  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed 
higher costs of our raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand 
coiled steel is the major raw material used in the manufacture of precision ball bearing slides and ergonomic computer support systems 
plastic resins for injection molded plastics are also an integral material for ergonomic computer support systems 
zinc is a principal raw material used in the manufacture of security products 
stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increased selling prices for our products

we are also a leading manufacturer of stainless steel exhaust systems  gauges and throttle controls for the performance boat industry 
operating income overview we reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in we improved our product mix in as compared to through our emphasis on selling higher margin products and improving our operating efficiency through our continued focus on reducing costs 
however  these improvements were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of costs related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one newly completed facility  the unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions  all of which resulted in a net decrease in operating income from to we also experienced higher raw material costs in and  although the unfavorable impact on gross margin was largely mitigated through the implementation of sales price increases on most products that were affected 
our operating income increased from to primarily due to a more favorable product mix  the impact of two marine acquisitions  and our on going focus on reducing costs partially offset by the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by  and negatively impacted operating income by million 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted sales in as compared to by million  and negatively impacted operating income by million 
the impact on net sales is primarily due to the strengthening canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
the net impact on operating income primarily results from our canadian operations  due to the relative increase in costs as a result of the stronger canadian dollar 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments inventory reserves we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we also consider the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  we may be required to recognize additional inventory reserves 
long lived assets we account for our long lived assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess property  equipment and capitalized permit costs for impairment only when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
our determination is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
during  we consolidated certain of our operations and no longer utilized one of our owned manufacturing facilities 
in november of  this facility and related assets met the criteria for assets held for sale and we concluded that the carrying amount of the assets exceeded estimated fair value less costs to sell such assets  which resulted in a loss of  during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to review goodwill for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of our annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values of these three reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections 
significant judgment is required in estimating cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting in accordance with the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of the previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to us in the us in this regard  during we determined that certain of the undistributed earnings of our non us operations could no longer be considered permanently reinvested  and in accordance with gaap we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change 
results of operations compared to and compared to years ended december  change dollars in millions net sales cost of good sold gross margin operating costs and expenses operating income percent of net sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating costs and expenses operating income net sales 
net sales decreased in as compared to principally due to lower sales of certain products to the office furniture market where asian competitors have established selling prices at a level below which we consider would return a minimal margin as well as lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions  offset in part by the effect of sales price increases for certain products to mitigate the effect of higher raw material costs 
net sales increased in as compared to principally due to new sales volumes generated from the august and april acquisitions of two marine components businesses  which increased sales by million in other factors contributing to the increase in sales include sales volume increases in security products resulting from improved demand and the favorable effects of currency exchange rates on furniture components sales  offset in part by sales volume decreases for certain furniture components products due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers 
costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased from to  and gross margin percentage increased from the prior year 
during  we experienced the favorable effects of an improved product mix and improvements in our operating efficiency through cost reductions partially offset by the unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of net sales in compared to  and as a result gross margin increased over the same period 
the resulting improvement in gross margin was primarily due to an improved product mix  with a decline in lower margin furniture components sales and an increase in sales of higher margin security and marine components products  as well as a continued focus on reducing costs  offset in part by higher raw material costs and the unfavorable effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales  as well as  gains and losses on plant  property and equipment and currency gains and losses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating costs and expenses increased from to primarily as a result of lower sales volumes  the increase in foreign exchange transaction losses due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar a loss increase over of million as well as costs related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one newly completed facility of approximately million 
these costs include abnormal manufacturing costs such as physical move costs  equipment installation  redundant labor and recruiting fees  and an impairment charge of  for fixed assets no longer in use 
approximately  of the impairment charge relates to the write down of our vacated river grove facility to its estimated net realizable value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales were comparable from to operating income 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating margins decreased to in compared to for as compared to  in we improved our product mix through our emphasis on selling higher margin products and continued our focus on improving our operating efficiency by reducing costs 
however  these improvements were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of the million in costs noted above related to the consolidation of three of our northern illinois facilities into one newly completed facility  a million unfavorable effect of relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates including the million related to foreign exchange transaction losses noted above  lower sales to the office furniture industry due to competition from lower priced asian manufacturers and lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions resulting in a net decrease in operating income from to operating income for increased million  or compared to and operating margins increased to in compared to for our operating income increased from to primarily due to a more favorable product mix  the impact of two marine acquisitions  and our on going focus on reducing costs partially offset by the negative impact of changes in currency exchange rates and higher raw material costs 
currency 
our furniture components segment has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states in canada and taiwan 
the majority of sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar with the remainder denominated in other currencies  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for our non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
our furniture components segment s net sales were positively impacted while their operating income was negatively impacted by currency exchange rates in the following amounts as compared to the currency exchange rates in effect during the prior year 
increase decrease year ended december  vs vs impact on in thousands net sales operating income the positive impact on sales relates to sales denominated in non us dollar currencies translating into higher us dollar sales due to a strengthening of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
the negative impact on operating income results from the us dollar denominated sales of non us operations converted into lower local currency amounts due to the weakening of the us dollar 
this negatively impacts margin as it results in less local currency generated from sales to cover the costs of non us operations which are denominated in the local currency 
general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel  stainless steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of our total cost of sales 
during  and  worldwide raw material costs increased significantly 
we occasionally enter into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not necessarily commit us to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows us to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins 
we anticipate further significant changes in the cost of these materials  from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products  it is often difficult to recover increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
other non operating income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other non operating income expense  net primarily includes interest income and was comparable from to other non operating income increased in compared to primarily due to higher interest rates on invested cash balances resulting in increased interest income 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately  in compared to as a result of financing the october repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock from an affiliate with a promissory note 
we expect interest expense will be higher in as compared to due to the issuance of the promissory note 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense was comparable from to provision for income taxes as a member of the contran tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
one such election is whether to claim a deduction or a tax credit against us taxable income with respect to foreign income taxes paid 
consistent with elections of the contran tax group  in  and we did not claim a credit with respect to foreign income taxes paid but instead we claimed a tax deduction 
this resulted in an increase in our effective income tax rate 
under gaap  we are required to recognize a deferred income tax liability with respect to the incremental us income taxes federal and state and foreign withholding taxes that we would incur when the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries are subsequently repatriated  unless we determine that those undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 
prior to the third quarter of  we had not recognized a deferred tax liability related to such incremental income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our non us operations  as those earnings were deemed to be permanently reinvested 
gaap requires us to reassess the permanent reinvestment conclusion on an ongoing basis to determine if our intentions have changed 
as of september   and based primarily upon changes in our strategic plans for certain of our non us operations  we determined that the undistributed earnings of those subsidiaries could no longer be considered to be permanently reinvested except for the pre earnings in taiwan 
accordingly  and in accordance with gaap  in we recognized an aggregate million provision for deferred income taxes on the aggregate undistributed earnings of these non us subsidiaries 
our effective income tax rate in  excluding the million provision discussed above  decreased from to in primarily due to the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings and a  income tax benefit recorded in related to the effect of the reduction in the canadian federal income tax rate and the elimination of the federal surtax on our previously recorded net deferred income tax liability 
our effective income tax rate was comparable at and in and  respectively 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for will approximate our effective income tax rate for segment results the key performance indicator for our segments is the level of their operating income see discussion below 
for additional information regarding our segments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales security products furniture components marine components total net sales gross margin security products furniture components marine components total gross margin operating income security products furniture components marine components corporate operating expenses total operating income operating income margin security products furniture components marine components total operating income margin security products 
security products net sales decreased to million in compared to million in gross margin percentage was comparable year over year 
operating income margin percentage decreased in compared to  which resulted in a decrease in operating income 
the margin percentage decrease was primarily due to million in costs incurred relating to the consolidation of two of our northern illinois security products facilities into a new facility shared with a marine components operation and lower sales volumes resulting from lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in gross margin percentage and operating income margin percentage in also improved over resulting in an increase in operating income from the combined sales growth and margin improvement 
the margin percentage increases were the result of a more favorable product mix and the leveraging of the fixed cost structure over higher net sales 
furniture components 
furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower sales volumes to the office furniture industry where  for certain products asian competitors have established selling prices at a level below which we consider would return a minimal margin and the effect of lower order rates from many of our customers due to unfavorable economic conditions 
gross margin percentage increased slightly in compared to due to an improved product mix from the replacement of high volume  low margin products sales lost to asian competitors with lower volume  higher margin sales and a reduction of operating costs  lower depreciation expense and improvements in operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and process improvements 
furniture components net sales decreased to million in from million in however  operating income margin declined only  due to reductions in operating costs and improvements in operational efficiencies through workforce reductions and process improvements  and an improved product mix from the replacement of high volume  low margin products sales lost to asian competitors with lower volume  higher margin sales 
marine components 
marine components net sales increased in from and in from due to the impact of acquisitions 
we acquired an initial marine components company in august with an additional acquisition occurring in april operating income increased in from as the result of the acquisitions and was comparable from to outlook demand is slowing across most product segments as customers react to the condition of the overall economy 
asian sourced competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue to be a challenge for us as asian manufacturers  particularly those located in china  gain share in certain markets 
we believe the impact of this environment will be mitigated through our on going initiatives to expand both new products and new market opportunities 
our strategy in responding to the competitive pricing pressure has included reducing production costs through product reengineering  improving manufacturing processes through lean manufacturing techniques and moving production to lower cost facilities  including our own asian based manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we continue to develop sources for lower cost components for certain product lines to strengthen our ability to meet competitive pricing when practical 
we also emphasize and focus on opportunities where we can provide value added customer support services that asian based manufacturers are generally unable to provide 
as a result of pursuing this strategy  we will forego certain segment sales in favor of developing new products and new market opportunities where we believe the combination of our cost control initiatives and value added approach will produce better results for our shareholders 
we also expect raw material cost volatility to continue during  which we may not be able to fully recover through price increases or surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital or capital expenditure purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness  primarily for short term working capital needs  or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 
consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to due to the timing of capital expenditures placed into service during versus depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to as the result of increased capital expenditures and the timing of assets and intangibles acquired through acquisitions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily the result of higher cash paid for income taxes in of million primarily relating to us taxes on dividends repatriated from our us subsidiaries  lower operating income of million  and a million increase in in cash used from relative changes in assets and liabilities excluding taxes primarily due to higher raw materials costs resulting in an increase in our inventory balance 
the increase in our cash provided by operating activities in as compared to is primarily the result of lower cash paid for income taxes in of million  higher operating income of million  and a million decrease in in cash used from relative changes in assets and liabilities excluding taxes primarily due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable and a lower inventory balance in our average days sales outstanding dso at december  was days compared to days at december  the increase is primarily due to the timing of collections on the higher accounts receivable balance as of december  for comparative purposes  our average dso was relatively flat at days for december  and days at december  our average number of days in inventory dii was days at december  and days at december  the increase in dii is primarily due to the higher cost of commodity raw materials during for comparative purposes our average dii was days at december  and days at december  the decrease is primarily due to reductions in raw materials during as we utilized the higher than normal balance in ending inventory at the end of that was acquired during as part of our efforts to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in the past three years have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
during  we constructed a new facility and consolidated three of our northern illinois facilities into one facility at a cost of approximately million 
the consolidation of three previously separate operations into one facility is expected to create opportunities to reduce operating costs and improve operating efficiencies 
as a part of the facility consolidation project  the lake bluff  illinois facility was sold in for approximately million which approximated book value and was leased back until we vacated the facility in october the river grove  illinois facility is no longer being utilized and met the asset held for sale criteria in november of we expect to dispose of the river grove facility during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we built a new facility for one of our marine components subsidiaries at a cost of million 
the new facility is expected to provide the subsidiary with sufficient capacity to take advantage of sales growth opportunities 
in april  we completed the acquisition of a marine component products business for million  net of cash acquired 
in august  we completed the acquisition of our initial marine component product business for million  net of cash acquired 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed the disposition of all of the net assets of our european thomas regout operations to members of thomas regout management for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds consisted of cash net of costs to sell of approximately million and a subordinated note for approximately million 
the subordinated note requires annual payments over a period of four years 
in april of and  we collected the first and second payments of million  respectively 
historically  the thomas regout european operations did not contribute significantly to net cash flows from operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million 
capital expenditure projects in emphasized improved production efficiency including replacement of equipment that is being retired and the facility consolidation discussed above 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
cash dividends paid totaled million 
per share in and million in each of and 
per share 
dividends paid decreased in as a result of the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock held by timet  an affiliate 
we purchased these shares for per share  or aggregate consideration of million  which we paid in the form of a consolidated promissory note 
at december   we had prepaid approximately million toward the promissory note 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the timet repurchase and cancellation of shares discussed above  we also repurchased approximately  shares of our class a common stock in market transactions for an aggregate of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in we prepaid million of indebtedness we assumed in our august marine components acquisition 
our million secured revolving bank credit facility is collateralized by of the ownership interests in our first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in our revolving bank credit agreement could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  our credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
at december  we had no balances outstanding under the facility and the full million was available for borrowing 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared 
to the extent that our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable to affiliate operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to long term debt  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during fixed asset acquisitions include firm purchase commitments for capital projects 
we currently estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately  during the next twelve months due to the expiration of certain tax statues or the resolution of certain examinations and filing procedures related to one or more of our subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  we do not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage market risks  nor do we enter into any contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  we were not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to currency exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our secured revolving bank credit agreement 
in conjunction with the repurchase and or cancellation of a net million shares of our class a common stock  during the fourth quarter of  we issued a promissory note for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   there was million outstanding on the promissory note which bears interest at libor plus  and the fair value of such indebtedness approximates its carrying value 
the interest rate is reset quarterly based on the three month libor 
currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling our products outside the united states principally canada and taiwan 
a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of our sales generated from our non us operations are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for these non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our non us sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
as already mentioned certain of our sales generated by our canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the related currency exchange rate market risk associated with receivables or future sales  we periodically enter into short term forward currency exchange contracts 
at each balance sheet date  any outstanding forward currency contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently unless the contract is designated as a hedge upon which the mark to market adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income 
we had no forward currency contracts outstanding at december  or other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
