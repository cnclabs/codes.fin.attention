the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
overall  was a strong year for the company 
income from continuing operations in benefited primarily from higher crude oil and natural gas prices in the exploration and production segment combined with an overall increase in natural gas production  primarily in the appalachian region 
these factors led to a million increase in income from continuing operations compared to the prior year 
in  the company recorded million of income from discontinued operations  consisting of a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of seci and million of income from seci prior to its sale in august seci  seneca s wholly owned subsidiary  was engaged in the exploration for  and the development and purchase of  natural gas and oil reserves in the provinces of alberta  saskatchewan and british columbia in canada 
combining both income from continuing operations and discontinued operations  the company s net income available for common stock decreased million in compared to the prior year 
the company s earnings are discussed further in the results of operations section that follows 
the company spent million on capital expenditures during  with approximately percent being spent in the exploration and production segment and percent being spent in the pipeline and storage segment 
management continues to believe that these segments provide the best earnings growth opportunities for shareholders 
in the exploration and production segment  the company s principal focus continues to be the development of its nearly one million acres in the appalachian region along with continued exploration and development in the gulf and west coast regions 
in the pipeline and storage segment  the majority of the expenditures were for construction costs of the empire connector project 
the empire connector is anticipated to be ready to commence service in december on or before the in service date of the millennium pipeline 
the company s capital expenditure program is discussed further in the capital resources and liquidity section that follows 
despite the positives mentioned above  the economy of the united states has become constrained by significant volatility and turmoil in the capital and credit markets 
the government s troubled asset relief program and decreases in federal funds rates have not been enough to stem the reluctance on the part of lenders to extend credit to businesses 
in the current period these events have not had a material impact on the company  although further disruption in the markets and tightening of credit availability could negatively impact future periods 
at september   the company had a strong balance sheet and liquidity 
the company had no outstanding short term notes payable to banks or commercial paper at that date 
however  since that date  the company has borrowed short term funds under its credit lines and through the commercial paper market to fund working capital needs 
the company maintains a number of individual uncommitted or 
table of contents discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed  or replaced by similar lines 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a syndicated committed credit facility totaling million that extends through september  during  the company began repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock under a share repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors 
the program authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate amount of eight million shares 
this threshold was reached during for a total program cost of million of which  shares were repurchased during the year ended september  for million 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional eight million shares 
under this new authorization  the company repurchased  shares for million through september  the company stopped repurchasing shares after september  in light of the unsettled nature of the credit markets 
however  such repurchases may be made in the future if conditions improve 
during  the company expects to finance its capital expenditure program  dividends  and operating expenses including retirement plan and other post retirement benefit funding with cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  and or short term borrowings 
as oil and gas commodity prices have decreased significantly from their highs during  it is possible that the company may have to rely more heavily on short term borrowings to meet its cash needs 
it is also possible that the company may choose to reduce its capital expenditures 
with the turmoil in the credit markets has come a significant decline in the stock markets 
this has had a significant impact on the asset values of the company s retirement plan and its veba trusts and h accounts 
the company anticipates funding million to million to the retirement plan and million to million to its veba trusts and h accounts during however  under the current funding requirements of the pension protection act  should market conditions at september  remain unchanged  contributions in future years could increase significantly 
this issue is discussed further in the other matters section that follows 
critical accounting estimates the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those estimates whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of accounting policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 

table of contents the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired 
all costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test  which is performed each quarter  determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net cash flows  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions to or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
because of the decline in the price of natural gas during the third and fourth quarters of  the book value of the company s canadian oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling at both june  and september  consequently  seci recorded impairment charges of million million after tax in the third quarter of and million million after tax in the fourth quarter of these impairment charges are included in the loss from discontinued operations for due to the sale of seci during at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
declines in commodity prices since that date have reduced the ceiling 
using more up to date pricing of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for crude oil  the ceiling at september  would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations in or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
upon the adoption of sfas on october   the company recorded an asset retirement obligation representing plugging and abandonment costs associated with the exploration and production segment s crude oil and natural gas wells and capitalized such costs in property  plant and equipment ie the full cost pool 
prior to the adoption of sfas  plugging and abandonment costs were accounted for solely through the company s units of production depletion calculation 
an estimate of such costs was added to the depletion base  which also included capitalized costs in the full cost pool and estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves 
with the adoption of sfas  plugging and abandonment costs are already 
table of contents included in capitalized costs and the units of production depletion calculation has been modified to exclude from the depletion base any estimate of future plugging and abandonment costs that are already recorded in the full cost pool 
prior to the adoption of sfas  in calculating the full cost ceiling  the company reduced the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves by the estimated plugging and abandonment costs 
such future net cash flows would then be compared to capitalized costs in the full cost pool  with any excess capitalized costs being expensed 
with the adoption of sfas  since the full cost pool now includes an amount associated with plugging and abandoning the wells  the calculation of the full cost ceiling has been changed so that future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves are no longer reduced by the estimated plugging and abandonment costs 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to sfas  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note c regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment and all other category  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  previously used an interest rate collar to limit interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the company accounted for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
in  the company discontinued hedge accounting for the interest rate collar  which resulted in a gain being recognized 
gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective based on the effectiveness testing  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair values of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
the company used a model to substantiate the values reported by the counterparties 
at september   the company established a credit reserve of million against the asset recorded on its books for non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the credit reserve was determined by applying default probabilities to the anticipated cash flows that the company is expecting from its counterparties 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section below for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected 
table of contents annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the company utilizes a yield curve model to determine the discount rate 
the yield curve is a spot rate yield curve that provides a zero coupon interest rate for each year into the future 
each year s anticipated benefit payments are discounted at the associated spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
the discount rate is then determined based on the spot interest rate that results in the same present value when applied to the same anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience  including deviations between actual versus expected return on plan assets  could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit costs for the utility and pipeline and storage segments represented and  respectively  of the company s total pension and post retirement benefit costs as determined under sfas and sfas for the years ended september  and changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could also have an impact on the benefit obligation and the funded status related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits and could impact the company s equity 
for example  the discount rate was changed from in to in the change in the discount rate from to reduced the retirement plan projected benefit obligation by million and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
other examples include actual versus expected return on plan assets  which has an impact on the funded status of the plans  and actual versus expected benefit payments  which has an impact on the pension plan projected benefit obligation and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
for  actual versus expected return on plan assets resulted in a decrease to the funded status of the retirement plan million and the veba trusts and h accounts million 
the actual versus expected benefit payments for caused an increase of million to the projected benefit obligation and a decrease of million to the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation  respectively 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the retirement plan and the accumulated post retirement obligation  the actuary takes into account the average remaining service life of active participants 
the average remaining service life of active participants is years for the retirement plan and years for those eligible for other post retirement benefits 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item  which includes a discussion of funding for the current year and the adoption of sfas  and to item at note g retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 

table of contents results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in as previously discussed  the company presented its canadian operations in the exploration and production segment in conjunction with the sale of seci as discontinued operations 
the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production and utility segments and the all other category  slightly offset by lower earnings in the corporate category and the timber  pipeline and storage  and energy marketing segments  as shown in the table below 
in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts  unless otherwise noted 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by several events in and  including events a million gain in the all other category associated with the sale of horizon power s gas powered turbine  events a million gain on the sale of seci  which was completed in august this amount is included in earnings from discontinued operations  a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment due to the reversal of a reserve established for all costs incurred related to the empire connector project recognized during june a million benefit to earnings in the pipeline and storage segment associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar  and a million benefit to earnings in the energy marketing segment related to the resolution of a purchased gas contingency 
compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in as previously discussed  the company has presented its canadian operations in the exploration and production segment in conjunction with the sale of seci as discontinued operations 
the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared with a loss of million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production  utility  pipeline and storage  and energy marketing segments and the corporate and all other categories  slightly offset by lower earnings in the timber segment  as shown in the table below 
the increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily resulted from the gain on the sale of seci recognized in as well as the non recurrence of million of impairment charges recognized in related to the exploration and production segment s canadian oil and gas assets 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by several events discussed above and the following events 
table of contents events million of impairment charges related to the exploration and production segment s canadian oil and gas assets under the full cost method of accounting using natural gas pricing at june  and september   an million benefit to earnings in the exploration and production segment million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations related to income tax adjustments recognized during  and a million benefit to earnings in the utility segment related to the correction of distribution corporation s calculation of the symmetrical sharing component of new york s gas adjustment rate

the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  which more than offset the revenue impact of lower retail sales volumes  as shown in the table above 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
this change was also affected by a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction effective january that increased operating revenues by million for the increase is included within both retail and transportation revenues in the table above 
in the new york jurisdiction  the nypsc issued an order providing for an annual rate increase of million beginning december  as part of this rate order  a rate design change was adopted that shifts a greater amount of cost recovery into the minimum bill amount  thus spreading the recovery of such costs more evenly throughout the year 
this rate design change resulted in lower retail and transportation revenues exclusive of the impact of higher gas costs during the winter months compared to the prior year and higher retail and transportation revenues in the spring and summer months compared to the prior year 
on a cumulative basis for  the impact of this rate order has been to lower operating revenues by million 
it is expected that there will be an increase in retail and transportation revenue in the first quarter of compared to the prior year as a result of the rate design change 
the increase in transportation revenues was also due to a bcf increase in transportation throughput  largely the result of the migration of customers from retail sales to transportation service 
as reported in  on november  the us court of appeals vacated and remanded the ferc s order no 
regarding affiliate standards of conduct  with respect to natural gas pipelines 
the court s 
table of contents decision became effective on january   and on january   the ferc issued order no 
 its interim rule  designed to respond to the court s decision 
in order no 
 as clarified by the ferc on march   the ferc readopted  on an interim basis  certain provisions that existed prior to the issuance of order no 
that had made it possible for the utility segment to engage in certain off system sales without triggering the adverse consequences that would otherwise arise under the order no 
standards of conduct 
as a result  the utility segment resumed engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines as of may  resulting in total off system sales revenues of million and million for and  respectively 
due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins in and the increase in other operating revenues of million is largely related to amounts recorded pursuant to rate settlements approved by the nypsc 
in accordance with these settlements  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation utilized million of the cost mitigation reserve  which increased other operating revenues  to recover previous undercollections of pension expenses 
the impact of that increase in other operating revenues was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense thus there is no earnings impact 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a million decrease in retail gas sales revenues 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in transportation revenues and a million increase in off system sales revenues 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  which more than offset the revenue impact of higher retail sales volumes  as shown in the table above 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
this decrease was offset slightly by a base rate increase in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  effective january  which increased operating revenues by million for the increase is included within both retail and transportation revenues in the table above 
the increase in transportation revenues was primarily due to a bcf increase in transportation throughput  largely due to the migration of retail sales customers to transportation service 
the corresponding million increase in transportation revenues would have been greater if not for a million out of period adjustment recorded in the first quarter of to correct distribution corporation s calculation of the symmetrical sharing component of new york s gas adjustment rate 
the increase in off system sales revenue is due to the resumption of off system sales in may pursuant to ferc authorization  as discussed above 
purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item 
table of contents earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a million overall decrease in operating expenses mostly other post retirement benefits and bad debt expense  higher non cash interest income on a pension related regulatory asset million  a decrease in property  franchise  and other taxes million  a decrease in depreciation expense million  lower income tax expense million  lower interest expense million  and increased usage per account million 
the impact of these items more than offset lower base rates due to the rate design change described above million  and routine regulatory adjustments that reduced earnings by million 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a base rate increase million that became effective january  an increase in normalized usage million  a decrease in bad debt expense million  and a decrease in property  franchise  and other taxes million 
warmer weather million partially offset these increases 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in and  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  as the weather was warmer than normal 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in in the new york jurisdiction  earnings decreased by million 
this was primarily due to lower interest income million 
the new york division s current rate agreement with the nypsc allows the company to accrue interest on a pension related regulatory asset 
the amount of interest that can be accrued is reduced as the funded status of the pension plan improves 
the fair market value of the pension plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation at september  resulting in a significant reduction in the interest accrual on this regulatory asset 
the out of period symmetrical sharing adjustment discussed above million  higher bad debt and other operating costs million  higher property taxes million  and higher interest expense million also contributed to this decrease 
the positive impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million and increased usage per account million partially offset the overall decrease 
in the pennsylvania jurisdiction  earnings increased by million 
this was primarily due to a base rate increase million that became effective january  colder weather million  and the positive impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million 
higher intercompany and other interest expense million  coupled with a decrease in normalized usage million  partially offset these increases 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction

in addition  there were increased efficiency gas revenues million reported as part of other revenues in the table above 
the majority of this increase was due to higher gas prices in the current year 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with  which was due mostly to a decrease in other revenues million 
the decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a million decrease in efficiency gas revenues 
this decrease was due to the company s recent settlement with the ferc  which decreased efficiency gas retainage allowances 
offsetting this decrease  there was a million increase in other revenues attributable to the lease termination fee adjustment in an intercompany transaction for the company s former headquarters  which did not recur in while supply corporation s transportation volumes decreased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the main factors contributing to this decrease were higher operation and maintenance expenses million  primarily caused by the non recurrence in of a reversal of a reserve for preliminary survey costs related to the empire connector project during 
table of contents million 
in addition  there was a million positive earnings impact during associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar that did not recur during  and the pipeline and storage segment experienced higher interest costs million 
these earnings decreases were offset by the earnings impact associated with higher transportation revenues million  an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction million and the earnings impact associated with higher efficiency gas revenues million 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the main factor contributing to this increase was the reversal of a reserve for preliminary survey costs million related to the empire connector project 
based on the signing of a service agreement with keyspan gas east corporation during the quarter ended june   management determined that it was probable that the project would go forward and that such preliminary survey costs were properly capitalizable in accordance with the ferc s uniform system of accounts and sfas in addition  there was a million increase in earnings associated with the decrease in depreciation expense as a result of the most recent settlement with the ferc  which reduced depreciation rates 
there was also a million positive earnings impact associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar 
on december   empire repaid million of secured debt 
the interest costs of this secured debt were hedged by the interest rate collar 
since the hedged transaction was settled and there will be no future cash flows associated with the secured debt  the unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the interest rate collar was reclassified to the income statement 
these earnings increases were offset by higher interest expense million  the earnings impact associated with lower efficiency gas revenues million  a million increase in operating costs primarily post retirement benefit costs  and the earnings decrease associated with a higher effective tax rate million

gas production revenue 
table of contents after hedging from continuing operations increased million due to a per mcf increase in weighted average prices after hedging and a  mmcf increase in production 
the increase in gas production from continuing operations occurred primarily in the appalachian region  mmcf  consistent with increased drilling activity in the region 
the gulf coast region also contributed significantly to the increase in natural gas production from continuing operations mmcf 
production from new fields in primarily in the high island area outpaced declines in production from some existing fields  period to period 
production in this region would have been higher if not for the hurricane activity during the month of september as a result of hurricanes edouard  gustav and ike  production was shut in for much of the month of september  resulting in estimated lost production of approximately mmcf of natural gas and mbbl of oil 
while seneca s properties sustained only superficial damage from the hurricanes  approximately of the pre hurricane production remains shut in due to repair work on third party pipelines and onshore processing facilities 
the majority of this production is anticipated to return by december  refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues from continuing operations for the exploration and production segment increased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging increased million due primarily to an per barrel increase in weighted average prices after hedging  which more than offset a slight decrease in oil production of  barrels 
gas production revenue after hedging increased million in as compared with an increase in gas production of  mmcf and an increase in weighted average prices after hedging of per mcf both contributed to the increase 
the increase in gas production occurred primarily in the gulf coast region  mmcf 
during the quarter ended december   seneca experienced significant production delays due largely to the impact of hurricane damage to pipeline infrastructure in the gulf of mexico 
seneca had substantially all of its pre hurricane gulf of mexico production back on line at the beginning of fiscal production also increased in this segment s appalachian region mmcf  primarily due to increased drilling in this region during  as highlighted in item under exploration and production activities

earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings from continuing operations for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings from continuing operations of million for higher crude oil prices  higher natural gas prices and higher natural gas production increased earnings by million  million and million  respectively  while lower crude oil production decreased earnings by million 
higher lease operating costs million  higher depletion expense million  higher income tax expense million and higher general and administrative and other operating expenses million also negatively impacted earnings 
lower interest expense and higher interest income of million and million  respectively  partially offset these decreases to earnings 
the increase in lease operating costs resulted from the start up of production at the high island l field in october  higher steaming costs in california  and an increase in costs associated with a higher number of producing properties in appalachia 
the increase in depletion expense was caused by higher production and an increase in the depletable base 
the increase in general and administrative and other operating expenses resulted from an increase in staffing and associated costs for the growing appalachia division combined with the recognition of actual plugging costs in excess of previously accrued amounts 

table of contents compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings from continuing operations for were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings from continuing operations of million for higher crude oil prices  higher natural gas production and higher natural gas prices increased earnings by million  million and million  respectively 
these increases were partly offset by the non recurrence of million of tax benefits recognized during  as well as by higher depletion expense and higher lease operating expense of million and million  respectively 
slightly lower crude oil production and higher general and administrative expenses also decreased earnings by million and million  respectively 
earnings were also negatively impacted by higher income tax expense million 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in as compared with the increase is primarily due to higher gas sales revenue  as a result of an increase in the price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues  coupled with an increase in volumes 
the increase in volumes is primarily attributable to an increase in volumes sold to low margin wholesale customers  as well as an increase in the number of commercial and industrial customers served by the energy marketing segment 
the increase in volumes also reflects certain sales transactions undertaken to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain commodity purchase contracts 
the offsetting purchase and sale transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volumes sold with minimal impact to earnings 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease primarily reflects lower gas sales revenue due to a decrease in natural gas commodity prices for the period that were recovered through revenues  offset in part by an increase in volumes 
the increase in volumes was due to the addition of certain large  low margin commercial and industrial customers  an increase in sales to wholesale customers  and colder weather 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in higher operating costs of million primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense coupled with lower margins of million are primarily responsible for the decrease in earnings 
a major factor in the margin decrease is the non recurrence of a purchased gas expense 
table of contents adjustment recorded during the quarter ended march  during that quarter  the energy marketing segment reversed an accrual for million of purchased gas expense due to a resolution of a contingency 
the increase in volumes noted above  the profitable sale of certain gas held as inventory  and the marketing flexibility that the energy marketing segment derives from its contracts for significant storage capacity partially offset the margin decrease associated with the purchased gas adjustment 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in higher margins of million are responsible for the increase in earnings 
the increase in margin is mainly the result of a million reversal of an accrual for purchased gas expense related to the resolution of a contingency during while volumes increased  as noted above  much of this increase in volume is related to sales to low margin customers 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dried lumber sales other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales green lumber sales kiln dried lumber sales compared with operating revenues for the timber segment decreased million in as compared with unfavorable market conditions for cherry logs and lumber combined with wet weather conditions that hampered harvesting were the main factors causing the decrease 
the decrease consisted of a million decline in kiln dried lumber sales 
the decrease in kiln dried lumber sales was due to both a decline in the market price of kiln dried lumber as well as a  board feet decline in kiln dried lumber sales volumes primarily kiln dried cherry lumber sales volumes 
log sales also decreased million primarily due to a decline in cherry veneer log sales volumes of  board feet 
cherry veneer logs are more valuable and sell at higher prices than other species and have the largest impact on overall log sales revenue 
in addition  in the timber segment sold million board feet of timber rights and recorded a gain of million in other revenues 
this event did not recur in 
table of contents compared with operating revenues for the timber segment decreased million in as compared with this decrease is attributed to unfavorable weather conditions primarily during the fall of and the spring of that greatly limited the harvesting of logs 
these conditions consisted of warm  wet weather that made it difficult to bring logging trucks into the forests 
weather conditions were significantly more favorable throughout fiscal these unfavorable conditions for harvesting resulted in a decline in log sales of million or  board feet 
there was also a decline in both green lumber and kiln dried lumber sales of million and million  respectively  primarily because there were fewer logs available for processing 
declines in market prices for the cherry and maple species also contributed to the decrease in green lumber and kiln dried lumber sales 
additionally  the processing of a greater amount of lumber species other than cherry due to the mix of species on the areas being harvested contributed to the decline in kiln dried lumber sales since lumber species other than cherry are sold at a lower price than kiln dried cherry lumber 
offsetting the decreases discussed above  other revenues increased million largely due to the sale of million board feet of timber rights million 
earnings compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease was primarily due to lower margins from lumber  log and timber rights sales million as a result of the decline in revenues noted above 
this decrease was partially offset by the earnings benefit associated with a lower effective tax rate million 
compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease was primarily due to lower margins from lumber and log sales million as a result of the decline in revenues noted above  as well as higher general and administrative expenses of million 
partially offsetting this decrease was a decline in depletion expense of million 
the decrease in depletion expense reflects the cutting of more low cost or no cost basis timber from company owned land as well as the overall decrease in logs harvested 
all other and corporate operations all other and corporate operations primarily includes the operations of horizon lfg  horizon power  former international segment activity and corporate operations 
horizon lfg owns and operates short distance landfill gas pipeline companies

earnings compared with all other and corporate operations had earnings of million in  a decrease of million compared with earnings of million for the positive earnings impact of higher income from unconsolidated subsidiaries million and a gain on the sale of a turbine by horizon power million were more than offset by higher operating costs million  higher income tax expense million and lower interest income million 
the increase in operating costs is primarily the result of the proxy contest with new mountain vantage gp  llc 
table of contents compared with all other and corporate operations had earnings of million in  an increase of million compared with earnings of million for this improvement was largely due to an increase in interest income of million primarily intercompany interest 
in the all other category  horizon lfg s earnings benefited from higher margins of million in as compared to  and horizon power s income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased million  also contributing to the increase in earnings 
the corporate and all other categories also had an earnings benefit associated with lower income tax expense million 
interest income interest income was million higher in as compared to the main reason for this increase was a million increase in interest income on a pension related regulatory asset in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction 
the exploration and production segment also contributed million to this increase as a result of the investment of cash proceeds from the sale of seci in august interest income was million lower in as compared to as discussed in the utility earnings section above  the main reason for this decrease was a million decrease in interest income on a pension related regulatory asset in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction 
other income other income was million higher in as compared to this increase is attributed to the increase in the allowance for funds used during construction  in the pipeline and storage segment  associated with the empire connector project of million 
this increase was partially offset by the non recurrence of a death benefit gain on life insurance proceeds of million recognized in the corporate category in other income was million higher in as compared to the increase is attributed to a death benefit gain on life insurance proceeds of million recognized in the corporate category 
interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt increased million in as compared to the increase in was primarily the result of a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding 
in april  the company issued million of senior  unsecured notes due in april this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes that matured on may  interest on long term debt decreased million in as compared to the decrease in was primarily the result of a lower average amount of long term debt outstanding 
in addition  the company recognized a million benefit to interest expense as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting for empire s interest rate collar  as discussed above under pipeline and storage 
the underlying long term debt associated with this interest rate collar was repaid in december and the unrealized gain recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the interest rate collar was reclassified to interest expense during the quarter ended december  other interest charges decreased million in compared to other interest charges did not change significantly in as compared to the decrease in was primarily caused by a million increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction related to the empire connector project 

table of contents capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in partnership net proceeds from sale of foreign subsidiaries cash held in escrow net proceeds from sale of oil and gas producing properties other investing activities reduction of long term debt net proceeds from issuance of long term debt issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation awards shares repurchased under repurchase plan effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for non cash expenses  non cash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  impairment of oil and gas producing properties  impairment of investment in partnership  deferred income taxes  income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries net of cash distributions and gain on sale of discontinued operations 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is partially due to lower working capital requirements in the utility segment 
in the exploration and production segment  cash provided by operations increased due to higher commodity prices  partially offset by the decrease in cash provided by operations that resulted from the sale of seci in august offsetting these increases were higher working capital requirements in the energy marketing segment 

table of contents investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures year ended september  total expenditures for long lived assets millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production timber all other and corporate eliminations amount includes million of accrued capital expenditures related to the empire connector project 
this amount has been excluded from the consolidated statement of cash flows at september  since it represents a non cash investing activity at that date 
represents million of capital expenditures included in the appalachian region of the exploration and production segment for the purchase of storage facilities  buildings  and base gas from supply corporation during the quarter ended march  utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines 
pipeline and storage the majority of the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures were related to the empire connector project costs  which is discussed below under estimated capital expenditures  as well as for additions  improvements and replacements to this segment s transmission and gas storage systems 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures were primarily well drilling and completion expenditures and included approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which was for the off shore program in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
these amounts included approximately million spent to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
the appalachian region capital expenditures include million for the purchase of storage facilities  buildings  and base gas from supply corporation  as shown in the table above

estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production timber includes estimated expenditures for the years ended september   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of new equipment 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated on the completion of the empire connector project as discussed below  the replacement of transmission and storage lines  the reconditioning of storage wells and improvements of compressor stations 
the company continues to explore various opportunities to expand its capabilities to transport gas to the east coast  either through the supply corporation or empire systems or in partnership with others 
construction of the empire connector  a pipeline designed to transport up to approximately mdth of natural gas per day that will connect the empire pipeline with the millennium pipeline  began in september the empire connector is anticipated to be ready to commence service in december  on or before the in service date of the millennium pipeline 
refer to the rate and regulatory matters section that follows for further discussion of this matter 
the total cost to the company of the empire connector project is estimated at million  after giving effect to sales tax exemptions worth approximately million 
as of september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs related to this project 
of this amount  million  million and million were incurred during the years ended september   and  respectively 
all project costs incurred as of september  have been capitalized as construction work in progress 
the company anticipates financing the remaining cost of this project with cash from operations 
in light of the rapidly growing demand for pipeline capacity to move natural gas from new wells being drilled in appalachia specifically in the marcellus shale producing area supply corporation recently completed an open season for its appalachian lateral applat pipeline project 
the applat is expected to be routed through areas in pennsylvania where producers are actively drilling and are seeking market access for their newly discovered reserves 
the applat will complement supply s original west to east we project  which was designed to transport rockies gas supply from clarington to the ellisburg leidy corning area and includes the tuscarora to corning facilities previously referred to as the tuscarora extension 
the applat will transport gas supply from pennsylvania s producing area to the overbeck area of supply corporation s existing system  where the facilities associated with the we project will move the gas to eastern market points  including leidy  and to interconnections with millennium and empire at corning 
in conjunction with the we and applat transportation projects  supply corporation has plans to develop new storage capacity by pursuing expansion of certain of its existing storage facilities 
the expansion of these 
table of contents fields  which supply corporation is marketing through a recently completed open season concurrent with its applat open season  could provide approximately mmdth of incremental storage capacity with incremental withdrawal deliverability of up to mdth of natural gas per day  with service commencing as early as supply corporation expects that the availability of this incremental storage capacity will complement the we and applat pipeline projects and help meet the demand for storage created by the prospective increased flow of appalachian and rockies gas supply into the western pennsylvania area  although traditional gas supplies will also be able to take advantage of this incremental storage capacity 
the timeline associated with supply corporation s pipeline and storage projects depends on market development 
the capital cost of the applat we project is estimated to be approximately million  and is expected to be financed by a combination of debt and equity 
as of september   million has been spent to study the we and applat projects  and approximately million has been spent to study the storage expansion project 
costs associated with these projects have been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and have been fully reserved for at september  supply corporation has not yet filed an application with the ferc for the authority to build either pipeline project or the storage expansion 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the gulf coast region  substantially all of which is for the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
estimated capital expenditures in in the timber segment will be concentrated on the purchase of new equipment  vehicles and improvements to facilities for this segment s lumber yard  sawmill and kiln operations 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations  partnerships and other business entities 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow the company did not have any outstanding short term notes payable to banks or commercial paper at september  however  the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  margin calls on derivative financial instruments  exploration and development expenditures  repurchases of stock  and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes

the constraints specified in the committed credit facility would permit an additional billion in short term and or long term debt to be outstanding further limited by the indenture covenants discussed below before the company s debt to capitalization ratio would exceed 
if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could 
table of contents borrow under its committed credit facility  uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of billion in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
the company s indenture  pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued  contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement  or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived

rate and regulatory matters utility operation base rate adjustments in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses of the appropriate regulatory authorities 
new york jurisdiction on january   distribution corporation commenced a rate case by filing proposed tariff amendments and supporting testimony requesting approval to increase its annual revenues by million 
following standard procedure  the nypsc suspended the proposed tariff amendments to enable its staff and intervenors to conduct a routine investigation and hold hearings 
distribution corporation explained in the filing that its request for rate relief was necessitated by decreased revenues resulting from customer conservation efforts and increased customer uncollectibles  among other things 
the rate filing also included a proposal for an efficiency and conservation initiative with a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to render the company indifferent to throughput reductions resulting from conservation 
on september   the nypsc issued an order approving  with modifications  distribution corporation s conservation program for implementation on an accelerated basis 
associated ratemaking issues  however  were reserved for consideration in the rate 
on december   the nypsc issued a rate order providing for an annual rate increase of million  together with a monthly bill surcharge that would collect up to million to recover expenses for implementation of the conservation program
