in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must 
table of contents make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the third quarter as the measurement date 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one or more of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our dsg reporting unit began implementing a new business plan that included exiting unprofitable market segments  exiting distribution of low margin branded products  and increased focus on digital signage 
historically  dsg has not always achieved projected revenue and operating margins as expected 
in estimating the fair value of dsg during the fourth quarter  we re assessed the level of risk associated with dsg achieving future operating results and cash flows 
the results of our goodwill impairment test as of march   indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our dsg segment of million was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment of million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a million tax benefit related to the impairment charge 
the results of our goodwill impairment tests as of march   for rfpd and edg indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value

we recorded a pretax gain of million during the third quarter of fiscal with respect to the sale of this property 
other income and expense other income expense was an expense of million during fiscal compared with an expense of million during fiscal the increase in other expense during fiscal was due primarily to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in interest expense  partially offset by costs incurred during the first quarter of fiscal associated with the retirement of long term debt 
other income expense included a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal as compared to a foreign exchange gain of million during fiscal the foreign exchange loss during fiscal includes a loss of approximately million relating to cash received from the sale of our security systems division burtek systems ssd burtek business that was temporarily held in our european entities 
other income expense includes costs associated with the retirement of long term debt of million during the first quarter of fiscal

income tax provision the effective income tax rates during fiscal and were and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory rate of primarily results from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses  foreign income subject to us tax and valuation allowances related to net operating losses 
at may   domestic federal net operating loss nol carryforwards amount to approximately million 
these federal nols expire between and domestic state nol carryforwards amount to approximately million 
these state nols expire between and foreign nol carryforwards total approximately million with various or indefinite expiration dates 
we also have an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward at may   in the amount of million that has an indefinite carryforward period 
income taxes paid  including foreign estimated tax payments  were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
at may   all of the cumulative positive earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which amounted to million  are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas 
due to various tax attributes that are continually changing  it is not possible to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
during fiscal  the canadian taxing authority proposed an income tax assessment for fiscal through fiscal we appealed the income tax assessment  however  we paid the entire tax liability in fiscal to the canadian taxing authority to avoid additional interest and penalties if our appeal was denied 
the payment was recorded as an increase to income tax provision in fiscal in may  the appeal was settled in our favor 
we recorded a reduction to income tax provision for approximately million related to the appeal settlement and subsequently received the refund during fiscal in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we are no longer subject to either us federal  state  or local tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to fiscal year with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal year our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are the united kingdom  germany  singapore  and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in germany  the netherlands  and singapore beginning in fiscal year  and in the united kingdom beginning in fiscal year 
table of contents effective june   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes  fin 
the application of fin would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of a valuation allowance against net operating losses 
in addition  we reclassified million of income tax liabilities from current liabilities to non current liabilities as we do not anticipate settling the liabilities within the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits in thousands balance as of june  increases due to currency translation decreases due to settlements decreases related to the expiration of statute of limitations balance as of may  at may   our worldwide liability for uncertain tax positions was million  excluding interest and penalties 
unrecognized tax benefits of million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
we record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statement of operations 
as of may   we have recorded a liability for interest and potential penalties of million 
it is reasonably possible that there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits in the range of to approximately million due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations within the next twelve months 
discontinued operations on may   we completed the sale of the ssd burtek segment to honeywell international incorporated honeywell for million which resulted in an after tax gain of million after transactions costs 
therefore  ssd burtek is presented as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
and prior period results and disclosures have been restated to reflect this reporting 
the sale agreement of ssd burtek to honeywell contemplated a post closing working capital based purchase price adjustment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we received notification from honeywell seeking a purchase price adjustment in the amount of million 
during the third and fourth quarters  we reviewed and responded to honeywell s notice  and we are in discussions with honeywell to seek resolution of the open items 
we believe this claim to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend our position with respect to this claim 
should we ultimately pay honeywell all  or a significant portion  of the requested amount  it could have a material adverse impact on results of our discontinued operations and cash flows 
the following table summarizes results of discontinued operations  consisting of ssd burtek fiscal year ended may  june  june  net sales gross profit interest expense income tax provision benefit income loss  net of tax 
table of contents the net sales  gross profit  and income from discontinued operations during fiscal only represent the operations of our colombia location which was included in the ssd burtek sale agreement with honeywell  but were not transferred as part of the may   closing 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we mutually agreed with honeywell that honeywell would not purchase the ssd burtek colombia business  and that we would wind down the ssd burtek colombia business in exchange for a payment from honeywell equal to a portion of the value of the ssd burtek business in colombia on may   including reimbursement of related employee severance expenses 
we ceased operations of the ssd burtek business in colombia during the third quarter of fiscal the net sales  gross profit  and income from discontinued operations during fiscal and represent all locations included in the ssd burtek sale agreement with honeywell for the entire fiscal year 
ssd burtek net sales decreased slightly during fiscal to million  a decline from million in fiscal  due primarily to a decline in demand for private label products 
gross profit remained relatively flat during fiscal at million versus million during fiscal gross margin increased during fiscal to from during fiscal due primarily to lower inventory overstock and scrap expense 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 allocation of interest to discontinued operations we allocated interest expense to discontinued operations ssd burtek due to the requirement under our existing multi currency revolving credit agreement credit agreement to pay the proceeds from the sale of a business to the parties in the credit agreement

table of contents we believe that the existing sources of liquidity  including cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our revolving credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs for the fiscal year ending may  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of may   and june  impairment of investments we hold a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assess its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and our cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
we recognized investment impairment charges of less than million during fiscal  and million during fiscal we recognized no investment impairment charges during fiscal inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
inventories include material  labor  and overhead associated with such inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods held for sale 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation  obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the third quarter as the measurement date 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one or more of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our dsg reporting unit began implementing a new business plan that included exiting unprofitable market segments  exiting distribution of low margin branded products  and increased focus on digital signage 
historically  dsg has not always achieved projected revenue and operating margins as expected 
in estimating the fair value of dsg during the fourth quarter  we re assessed the level of risk associated with dsg achieving future operating results and cash flows 
the results of our goodwill impairment test as of march   indicated that the value of goodwill attributable to our dsg segment of million was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment of million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a million tax benefit related to the impairment charge 
the results of our goodwill impairment tests as of march   for rfpd and edg indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
we assess in accordance with sfas no 
 the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is reduced to its net realizable value 
the impairment charge is recorded in operating results 
the results of our impairment tests for fiscal and indicated no impairment of our long lived assets 
warranties we offer warranties for specific products we manufacture 
we also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
warranty terms generally range from one to three years 
we estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
we record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
each quarter  we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product by product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation 
the estimates with respect to new products are based generally on knowledge of the products  the extended warranty period  and warranty experience 

table of contents warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other available evidence

stock compensation effective june   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options 
we estimate fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life  and dividends 
compensation cost is recognized using a graded vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period  or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved  if shorter non substantive vesting period approach

income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
those factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we or any of our affiliates have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed by us at a minimum to overcome that negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards 
in evaluating the positive evidence available  expectations as to future taxable income would rarely be sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of recent cumulative losses  even if supported by detailed forecasts and projections 
at may   and june   our deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for years 
we recorded valuation allowances for the majority of our federal deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards  and for tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
we believe that the deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are considered more likely than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
effective june   we adopted the provisions of fin the application of fin would have resulted in an increase in retained earnings of million  except that the increase was fully offset by the application of a valuation allowance against net operating losses 
in addition  we reclassified million of income tax liabilities from current liabilities to non current liabilities as we do not anticipate settling the liabilities within the next twelve months

 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement specifically requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures addressing the following how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows

accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements fsp no 
apb  which will change the accounting treatment for convertible securities which the issuer may settle fully or partially in cash 
under fsp no 
apb  cash settled convertible securities will be separated into their debt and equity components 
the value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature  and the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as a debt liability will be recorded as additional paid in capital 
as a result  the debt will be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate 
the debt will subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected on the income statement 
this change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of cash settled convertible securities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments certain operations  assets  and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk 
in addition  some of our debt financing varies with market rates exposing us to the market risk from changes in interest rates 
in order to provide the user of these financial statements guidance regarding the magnitude of these risks  the securities and exchange commission requires us to provide certain quantitative disclosures based upon hypothetical assumptions 
these disclosures include the calculation of the effect of a hypothetical increase in market interest rates and a hypothetical unfavorable change in the us dollar against foreign currencies on the reported net earnings and financial position 
interest expense exposure our credit agreement s interest rate varies based on market interest rates 
had interest rates increased  additional interest expense would have increased our net loss in fiscal and our net income in fiscal by an immaterial amount 
foreign currency exposure even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken  our foreign denominated financial statements are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and intercompany receivables and payables  as we conduct business in countries of the european union  asia pacific and  to a lesser extent  canada and latin america 
tools that we could use to manage foreign exchange exposures include currency clauses in sales contracts  local debt to offset asset exposures and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions 
we have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal or had the us dollar changed unfavorably against various foreign currencies  foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated million during fiscal and an estimated million during fiscal total assets would have declined by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended may   and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june   while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended may   and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june  the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect our operations
