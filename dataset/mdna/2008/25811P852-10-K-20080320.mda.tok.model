at december   commercial loans totaled million  or  of doral bank pr s gross loan and lease portfolio which included million in commercial loans secured by real estate 
commercial loans include lines of credit and term facilities to finance business operations and to provide working capital for specific purposes  such as to finance the purchase of assets  equipment or inventory 
since a borrower s cash flow from operations is generally the primary source of repayment  doral bank pr s analysis of the credit risk focuses heavily on the borrower s debt repayment capacity 
lines of credit are extended to businesses based on an analysis of the financial strength and integrity of the borrowers and are generally secured primarily by real estate  accounts receivable or inventory  and have a maturity of one year or less 
such lines of credit bear an interest rate that floats with a base rate  the prime rate  libor or another established index

commercial term loans generally have terms from one to five years 
they may be collateralized by the asset being acquired or other available assets and bear interest rates that float with the prime rate  libor or another established index  or are fixed for the term of the loan

at december   doral bank pr held million in leases  representing of its gross loan and lease portfolio 
during  approximately of all lease originations were automobile leases 
the remaining originations were primarily medical equipment and construction equipment leases 
while the granting of leases is governed by many aspects of doral financial s general credit policies and procedures  due to the nature of the exposure  additional credit parameters are applied to leases 
automobile leasing is done by way of finance leases  where the lessee is responsible for any residual value at the end of the lease term 
the credit risk associated with this product is generally higher than commercial lending 
doral bank pr tries to mitigate these risks by making the lessee responsible for the residual value and using a sound credit underwriting process 
credit controls  include but are not limited to  dollar limits amounts on new vehicle leases  maximum amounts on residuals  maximum terms  obligatory insurance  minimum income parameters  maximum debt service to income parameters and certain credit history parameters

doral will continue to evaluate and appraise market conditions to determine if and when it will resume such financing 
doral bank had traditionally been a leading player in puerto rico in providing interim construction loans to finance residential development projects  primarily in the affordable and midrange housing markets 
in  the company reassessed its risk exposure to the sector and made a strategic decision to restrict construction lending to established clients with proven track records 
in late  as a result of the continued downturn in the puerto rico housing market  the company decided that it would no longer underwrite new development projects and focus its efforts on collections  including assisting developers in marketing their properties to potential home buyers

doral mortgage units are co located with all of doral bank pr s retail bank branches 
doral bank pr supplements retail originations with wholesale purchases of loans from third parties 
doral bank pr maintains a centralized unit for the origination of interim construction loans

customers are sought through advertising campaigns in local newspapers and television  as well as direct mail and telemarketing campaigns

during the third quarter of  doral financial terminated its purchases of whole loans in bulk without the associated servicing rights 
for more information on doral financial s loan origination channels  refer to table j loan origination sources in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 

table of contents mortgage loan underwriting doral bank pr s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank pr s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceeds 
doral bank pr also offers certain first mortgage products with higher loan to value ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank pr may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined loan to value ratio exceeds 
doral bank pr does not originate adjustable rate mortgages arm or negatively amortizing loans 
during the first half of  the company originated loans through various mortgage banking subsidiaries each of which had different underwriting processes 
during the second half of  the company revamped its underwriting process to achieve a uniform rules based standard and improve the quality of its non conforming loan originations 
the implementation of these standards contributed to a significant reduction in the company s loan originations during the second half of and the first two quarters of the company  however  believes that these changes have allowed it to more efficiently underwrite assets with better credit quality that is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its loan production 
doral bank pr retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
the implementation of the adjustments to the company s underwriting standards described above has resulted in loan originations with higher fico scores 
set forth below is additional information about the fico scores used the latest score available to date updated as of august  of residential loans serviced by the company as of december  dollars in thousands residential percentage of fico scores servicing portfolio total portfolio not available or below and above total weighted average fico excludes us servicing 
also excludes commercial  multi family and construction loans serviced by the company 
weighted average fico scores do not include loans for which the fico score was not available 
mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
doral financial also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
in july of  all servicing operations were transferred to doral bank pr 
the company believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tool because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value 
table of contents of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank pr s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank pr serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank pr s servicing rights by either of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank pr s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank pr may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table k mortgage loan servicing in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
in the past  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank pr assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including that of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha loans  rhs loans or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december  and  doral financial issued approximately million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  doral financial securitized approximately million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december  and  doral financial sold approximately million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
prior to july  the company also sold mortgage loans that did not conform to gnma  fnma or fhlmc requirements non conforming loans as whole loans to local financial institutions or to fnma or fhlmc and other financial institutions in negotiated transactions 
many of doral financial s whole loan sales to local financial institutions historically were structured similarly to securitization transactions 
when doral financial sold a pool of loans to an investor  it retained the servicing rights and agreed to pay the purchaser a specified pass through rate for the entire pool that was below the weighted average coupon of the underlying mortgage loans 
any amounts received on the mortgages above the pass through rate were retained by doral financial 
the pass through rate paid to the investors was normally a variable rate generally based on a spread over the three month libor 
the present values of the future cash flows retained by doral financial above any contractual servicing fees are recognized on the company s financial statements as interest only strips ios 
since july  doral financial no longer structures its whole loan sales in this manner and sold its non conforming loans in the us secondary market for cash without any retained interest  other than the retained mortgage servicing rights 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
pursuant to the restructuring of several recourse transactions consummated during  the company s outstanding principal balance of loans sold subject to recourse decreased by billion  from billion as of december  to billion as of december  as of december  and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
as of december  and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
commencing in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  when the company sold non conforming loans to major financial institutions in the us mainland it has done so on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
during  the company retained all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan originations in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default  the company retains credit risk exposure on those loans 
if there is a breach of a representation or warranty or if there is an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies 
see item a

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code of the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage 
table of contents backed securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
this favorable tax treatment allows doral financial to sell tax exempt puerto rico gnma mortgage backed securities to local investors at higher prices than those at which comparable instruments trade in the us mainland  and reduces its effective tax rate through the receipt of tax exempt interest 
insurance agency activities in order to take advantage of the cross marketing opportunities provided by financial modernization legislation  enacted in  doral financial entered the insurance agency business in puerto rico 
doral insurance agency currently earns commissions by acting as agent in connection with the sale of insurance policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies 
during  and  doral insurance agency produced insurance fees and commissions of million  million and million  respectively 
doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers 
future growth of doral insurance agency s revenues will be tied to the company s level of mortgage originations  its ability to expand the products and services it provides and its ability to cross market its services to doral financial s existing customer base 
on february   doral insurance agency acquired an insurance portfolio of approximately  policies from citiseguros pr inc  a subsidiary of citibank  na puerto rico

most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than the price of oil are determined by the policies of  and economic conditions prevailing in  the united states 
these external factors include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of puerto rico s exports went to the us mainland  which was also the source of approximately of puerto rico s imports 
in the past  the economy of puerto rico has generally followed economic trends in the overall united states economy 
however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the services sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  and tourism  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment 
preliminary figures for the fiscal year ended june  show that gross national product increased from billion in current dollars for fiscal year to billion in current dollars for fiscal year in fiscal year  personal income per capita was  total average annual employment as measured by  the puerto rico department of labor and human resources household employment survey  increased from fiscal year to fiscal year  reaching  unemployment  although at relatively low historical levels  remains well above the united states average 
the average unemployment rate decreased from the reported in fiscal year to in fiscal year the unemployment rate for the first seven months of fiscal year was  a decrease from for the same period of fiscal year employment figures for the first three months of fiscal year show that unemployment is increasing  reaching for september the value of construction permits decreased by for the first ten months of compared to the same period in future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability in the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates and changes to existing tax incentive legislation 
currently  after a number of downward revisions reflecting deterioration in several key economic indicators  the puerto rico planning board estimated that the real gross national product decreased by for the fiscal year ending june  key economic indicators show that the economy has been contracting since april and 
table of contents this trend is expected to continue through the first half of the head of the pr planning board economic research unit recently stated that forecasted growth for fiscal year would be revised downward to a negative 
the major factors currently adversely affecting the economy are the relatively high level of oil prices  the depreciation of the dollar which affects the value of imports from foreign countries  which account for approximately of total imports to puerto rico  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the commonwealth s fiscal crisis  among others 
current fiscal situation 
on may   the governor signed a legislation providing for fiscal reform of the commonwealth government  including  among other things  the reduction of government spending  the elimination or consolidation of redundant agencies and the reduction of government payroll 
on july   the puerto rico legislature approved legislation amending the pr code to provide  among other things  for a general sales and use tax of and a municipal sales and use tax of 
although the tax and fiscal reforms have been adopted  there can be no assurance that such measures will generate the projected revenues or savings 
the secretary of treasury has publicly stated that governmental revenues are lagging behind projections for the fiscal year ending june  the inability for the government to approve a budget in a timely fashion led to a two week government shutdown in the company cannot predict the impact that the current fiscal situation of the commonwealth of puerto rico will have on the puerto rico economy and thus on doral financial s operations 
ratings of commonwealth of puerto rico obligations 
on may   s p lowered its rating on the commonwealth s general obligation debt to bbb  changed its ratings outlook to stable and confirmed its bbb rating on the commonwealth s appropriation debt 
s p had placed a negative rating outlook on the commonwealth s general obligation debt on march   as a result of the commonwealth s anticipated budget deficit for fiscal year  slow progress on tax and fiscal reform and the apparent political impasse regarding these measures 
in november  moody s confirmed its baa and ba rating on the commonwealth s general obligation debt and appropriation debt  respectively  but upgraded the outlook of the commonwealth s credit ratings to stable from negative

capital adequacy under the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies  the minimum guidelines for the ratio of qualifying total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital is to be comprised of common equity  retained earnings  minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  in the case of a bank holding company  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves tier capital 
the federal reserve has adopted regulations that require most intangibles  including core deposit intangibles  to be deducted from tier l capital 
the regulations  however  permit the inclusion of a limited amount of intangibles related to readily marketable mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships and include a grandfather provision permitting the continued inclusion of certain existing intangibles 
in addition  the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s market risk capital measure 
all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital  less all intangibles  to average total assets  less all intangibles 

table of contents the fdic and the ots have established regulatory capital requirements for state non member insured banks and federal savings banks  such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  respectively  that are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
set forth below are doral financial s  doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital ratios at december   based on existing federal reserve  fdic and ots guidelines

tier capital to average assets in the case of doral financial and doral bank pr and tier capital to adjusted total assets in the case of doral bank ny 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny were in compliance with all the regulatory capital requirements that were applicable to them as a state non member bank and federal savings bank  respectively 
see pat ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regulatory capital ratios for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory capital ratios 
both of the company s banking subsidiaries are well capitalized 
under the consent order entered into with the federal reserve  the company filed a capital plan with the federal reserve in which it agreed to maintain a leverage ratio of at least for doral financial and for doral bank pr 
as a result in the increase in the allowance for loan losses recorded by doral bank pr during the fourth quarter of  its leverage ratio dropped to 
as a result of the completion of the recapitalization in july  doral financial leverage ratio increased well above required levels 
on february   the board of directors of doral financial approved a capital infusion of million to doral bank  pr to raise its leverage ratio above 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank holding company or an insured bank to a variety of enforcement remedies  including  with respect to an insured bank or savings bank  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on its business 
see fdicia below 
basel ii capital standards the minimum risk based capital requirements adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee published its new capital guidelines basel ii governing the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations core banking organizations with at least billion in total assets or at least billion in foreign exposure 
in november  the federal banking agencies adopted final rules to implement basel ii for core banking organizations 
under basel ii  core banking organizations will be required to enhance the measurement and management of their risks  including credit risk and operational risk  through the use of advanced approaches for calculating risk based capital requirements 
the agencies announced they will issue a proposed rule that will provide all non core banking organizations which are not required to adopt basel ii s advance approaches  such as doral bank pr  with the option to adopt a standardized approach under basel ii 
the proposed rule is intended to be finalized before the core banking organizations may start their first transition period under basel ii december  
this new proposal will replace the earlier proposal to adopt the so called basel ia option 

table of contents until such time as the new rules for non core banking institutions are adopted  doral financial is unable to predict whether it will adopt a standardized approach under basel ii or the effect that the new rules for non core banking institutions might have on doral bank pr s financial condition or results of its operations 
opting into the basel ii accord standard would require doral bank to implement advanced measurement techniques employing internal estimates of certain key risk drivers to derive capital requirements 
opting into the basel ii accord may also require meeting more onerous computational requirements 
prior to implementation of the new capital regime  a bank holding company will be required to demonstrate to its primary federal regulator that its measurement approaches meet relevant supervisory standards 
fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries were well capitalized 
doral financial s  doral bank pr s and doral bank ny s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral financial  doral bank pr or doral bank ny  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the institutions financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank pr and doral bank ny  but they are not 
table of contents directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking legislation effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act amendments to the fdia  doral bank pr is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act the iba  doral bank pr is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in doral bank pr s home state 
because doral bank pr does not currently operate in the mainland united states  it has not designated a home state for purposes of the iba 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or with respect to which home state determination rules will apply 
as a federal savings bank  doral bank ny is subject to the branching regulations promulgated by the ots 
such regulations allow doral bank ny to branch on an interstate basis without geographic limitations 
american jobs creation act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law the american jobs creation act of  which lowered the withholding tax rate imposed on distributions of us sourced dividends to a corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth of puerto rico from to 
dividend restrictions the payment of dividends to doral financial by its banking subsidiaries may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice that  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by fdicia 
see fdicia above for additional information 
on february   the ots notified doral bank ny that  until further notice  it could not pay any dividends to doral financial without the prior written approval of the ots 
in connection with the recapitalization  doral bank ny received the approval of the ots to make a capital distribution to doral financial in the amount of million of which million was made on july  the ots withdrew this notice on march  
table of contents on march   doral financial and its principal puerto rico banking subsidiary  doral bank pr  entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner 
the mutually agreed upon orders prohibit doral bank pr from paying dividends to doral financial without obtaining prior written approval from the fdic and federal reserve 
the fdic and the office of the commissioner lifted their consent order on january  the consent order with the federal reserve remains in effect

see regulation and supervision banking activities savings bank regulation  below  for a description of certain restrictions on doral bank ny s ability to pay dividends under ots regulations 
fdic insurance assessments the deposits of doral bank pr and doral bank ny are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
on february  the president of the united states signed the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act which became effective january  the reform act provides for the merger of the bank insurance fund bif and savings association insurance fund saif into a single deposit insurance fund dif  an increase in the maximum amount of insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts  and possible inflation adjustments in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts 
in addition  it granted a one time initial assessment credit of approximately billion to recognize institutions past contributions to the fund 
pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system  under which the assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the level of risk incurred in its activities 
an institution s risk category is based partly upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following supervisory subgroups a  b or c 
group a institutions are financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses  group b institutions are those that demonstrate weaknesses that  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration  and group c institutions are those for which there is a substantial probability that the fdic will suffer a loss in connection with the institution  unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness 
for  premiums related to deposits assessed by both the bif and the saif are to be assessed at a rate between cents and cents per of deposits 
in recent years  well capitalized and well managed banks have paid no premiums for fdic insurance 
in the future  even well capitalized and well managed banks may be required to pay premiums on deposit insurance 
it is not possible to determine when any such premiums will become assessable or the level of such premiums 
under the reform act  the fdic made significant changes to its risk based assessment system so that effective january  the fdic imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose 
the new fdic risk based assessment system imposes premiums based upon factors that vary depending upon the size of the bank 
these factors are for banks with less than billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  and certain financial ratios  for banks with billion up to billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  certain financial ratios and if at least one is available debt issuer ratings  and additional risk information  and for banks with over billion in assets capital level  supervisory rating  debt issuer ratings unless none are available in which case certain financial ratios are used  and additional risk information 
the fdic has adopted a new base schedule of rates that the fdic can adjust up or down  depending on the revenue needs of the dif  and has set initial premiums for that range from cents per of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category to cents per of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category 
the new assessment system is expected to result in increased annual assessments on the deposits of doral financial s banking subsidiaries of to basis points per of deposits 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries have available an fdic credit to offset future assessments 
significant increases in the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our costs once the credit is fully utilized 

table of contents the deposit insurance funds act of also separated the financing corporation assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the bif and saif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by the financing corporation is in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the current financing corporation annual assessment rate is cents per of deposits 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank ny had a deposit base of approximately billion and million  respectively 
community reinvestment under the community reinvestment act cra  each insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for such institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of an insured depository institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including application for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities and savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
doral bank pr received a rating of high satisfactory as of the most recent cra report of the fdic 
brokered deposits fdic regulations adopted under fdicia govern the receipt of brokered deposits 
under these regulations  a bank cannot accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits which term is defined also to include any deposit with an interest rate more than basis points above prevailing rates unless i it is well capitalized  or ii it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
doral financial does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of its banking subsidiaries  which are currently well capitalized institutions 
as of december   doral bank pr had a total of approximately billion of brokered deposits  compared to approximately billion as of december  doral bank pr uses brokered deposits as a source of inexpensive funding 
while  doral bank ny did not have any brokered deposits as of december   it has had brokered deposits in the past 
as of june   doral bank ny had approximately million of brokered deposits 
the brokered deposits were sold in the third quarter of in connection with the sale of doral bank ny s branch network and related assets 
usa patriot act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive anti terrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act 
title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of us anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the us treasury department treasury has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements on financial institutions  including doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 

table of contents failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
doral financial believes that the cost of complying with title iii of the usa patriot act is not likely to be material to doral financial

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
some of the factors that could cause doral financial s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated are discussed below 
risks relating to doral financial s business doral financial s business is concentrated in puerto rico and continued weakness of pr economy may continue to adversely affect doral financial 
doral financial s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
adverse political or economic developments  decreases in housing values or natural disasters  such as hurricanes  could result in a downturn in loan originations  an increase in the level of non performing assets  an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans and a reduction in the value of doral financial s loans and loan servicing portfolio 
since  the pr economy has been experiencing declining growth 
the puerto rico planning board estimates that real gross national product decreased by approximately for the fiscal year ended june  and after projecting nominal growth of for the fiscal year ending june  the head of planning board economic research unit publicly stated that this projection would be revised downward to a decrease of approximately 
the adverse economic conditions in puerto rico  the possibility of a recession in the united states  as well as increased uncertainty in the credit and real estate markets may also have an adverse effect on the credit quality of the company s loan portfolios  as delinquency rates are expected to increase in the short term  until the economy stabilizes 
also  a potential reduction in consumer spending may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of the company 
deteriorating credit quality particularly in real estate loans has adversely impacted doral financial and may continue to adversely impact doral financial 
doral financial has experienced a downturn in credit performances during  and doral financial expects credit conditions and the performance of its loan portfolio to continue to deteriorate in the near future 
the deterioration in credit conditions caused doral financial to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses in by  driven primarily by higher allocations related to construction commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans and land loans 
construction loans to finance residential or commercial project loans involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they are larger in size  concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic conditions 
the properties securing these loans are also harder to dispose of in foreclosure 
additional increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary in the future 
accordingly  a decrease in the quality of doral financial s credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s earnings and results of operations 
changes in interest rates could affect doral financial s income and cash flows 
doral financial s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond doral financial s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 

table of contents the preparation of doral financial s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect doral financial s financial statements 
three of doral financial s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the amount of its deferred tax asset 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates doral financial cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  nor that it will not recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
if doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses is not adequate  doral financial s business  financial condition  including its liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  doral financial may increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
for more information on the sensitivity of these estimates  please refer to the critical accounting policies section in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
as of december  doral financial had a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
the realization of doral financial s deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the value of this asset 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that doral financial will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
doral financial s results of operations would be negatively impacted if it determines that increases to its deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period 
for additional information on doral financial s deferred tax asset please refer to the information under the caption income taxes in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of its annual report on form k 
defective and repurchased loans may harm doral financial s business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  doral financial is required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the company and the loans being sold or securitized 
doral financial s obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact doral financial s ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsaleable or saleable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before doral financial detects a non compliance  doral financial may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or doral financial may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce doral financial s cash available for operations and liquidity 
the company s current management team believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but no assurance can be given that mistakes will not be made  or that certain employees will not deliberately violate the company s lending policies 
doral financial seeks to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
doral financial does not have a reserve on its financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases 
table of contents resulting from representation and warranty violations because it does not expect any such losses to be significant 
doral financial cannot assure however  that losses associated with defective loans will not adversely impact its results of operations or financial condition 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources under part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
doral financial is exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
doral financial is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
doral financial also often retains  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that do not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
doral financial suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
doral financial is subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
doral financial s profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that it services for third parties 
under many of its servicing contracts  doral financial must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that doral financial  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
doral financial generally recovers its advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  doral financial must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
doral financial must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and doral financial will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
doral financial may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
doral financial s success has been and will continue to be influenced by its ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
doral financial s ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with the resolution of legacy issues and business transformation efforts  and related risks and uncertainties 
management has identified several material weaknesses in doral financial s internal control over financial reporting 
doral financial s management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   due to several material weaknesses described in this annual report on form k 
a discussion of the material weaknesses that have been identified by management can be found in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
each material weakness results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
doral financial has devoted substantial internal and external resources to addressing the material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting over the last two years 
doral financial expects to continue spending significant resources until it remedies all the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting 

table of contents competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations 
doral financial faces significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of doral financial s competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force doral financial to increase the rates it offers on deposits or lower the rates it charges on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of doral financial s operations 
changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect doral financial 
as a financial institution  doral financial is subject to extensive federal and local governmental supervision and regulation 
any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the local legislature  could have a substantial impact on doral financial s operations and profitability 
doral financial and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into consent orders with these regulators  and these regulators could take action against the company or its banking subsidiaries 
as a regulated financial services firm  doral financial s good standing with its regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of its businesses 
doral financial is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve  doral bank pr is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic and the office of the commissioner and doral bank ny is subject to supervision and regulation by the ots and the fdic 
federal banking regulators  in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties  have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among others  the ability to assess civil monetary penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to require written agreements and to initiate injunctive actions 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings  banking regulatory matters in this annual report on form k  doral financial and doral bank pr have entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner  which  among other things  prohibit the company s banking subsidiaries from paying dividends to the parent company  and prohibit doral financial from paying dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  without regulatory approval and require doral bank pr to take various actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the bank secrecy act 
while the fdic and the office of the commissioner have lifted their consent orders  doral financial cannot predict whether any of these banking regulators will take any further action with respect to doral financial or its banking subsidiaries  or  if any such further action were taken  whether such action would have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
the company s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect the company s banking subsidiaries or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries  and such actions could have adverse effects on one or more of the company s stockholders 
risk relating to legacy issues doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties 
on august   doral financial received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york regarding the production of certain documents  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
doral financial cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or what the results of this investigation will be 
the effects and results of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
adverse developments related to this investigation  including any expansion of its scope  could negatively impact the company and could divert efforts and attention of its management team from doral financial s ordinary business operations 
doral financial may be required to pay material fines  judgments or settlements or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
this investigation could adversely affect doral financial s ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
doral financial may be required to advance significant amounts to cover the legal expenses of its former officers and directors 
under doral financial s by laws  doral financial is obligated to pay in advance the reasonable expenses incurred by former officers and directors in defending civil or criminal actions or proceedings pending final disposition of such actions 
since  doral financial has been advancing funds on behalf of various former officers and directors in connection with the grand jury proceeding referred to above and ongoing investigations by the securities and exchange commission relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
on march   a former treasurer of doral financial was indicted for alleged criminal violations involving securities and wire fraud 
while doral financial may be able to recover amounts advanced following a final disposition of the matter and may contest the reasonableness of the amounts requested to be advanced  the amounts required to be advanced in a lengthy criminal proceeding could be substantial and could materially adversely affect doral financial s results from operations

overview of results of operations on july   doral financial completed its recapitalization through  the private sale of  newly issued shares of common stock to doral holdings  a newly formed entity in which bear stearns merchant banking and other investors including funds managed by marathon asset management  perry capital  the de shaw group and tennenbaum capital invested  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
doral financial also transferred its mortgage servicing and mortgage origination operations to doral bank pr  its principal banking subsidiary  contributed its mortgage servicing and related assets to doral bank pr in the form of additional equity 
on july   the company sold the branch network of doral bank ny 
in connection with these transactions  doral bank pr obtained regulatory approval to pay a million cash dividend to the holding company and doral bank ny received regulatory approval to effect a capital distribution to the holding company in the amount of million  of which million was paid on july  the transactions described above resulted in the significant recapitalization of the holding company and provided the holding company with sufficient funds to repay in full its million floating rate senior notes that matured on july   to fund in august the settlement of the restatement related consolidated class action and derivative shareholder litigation  and to pay related transaction expenses 
the recapitalization also greatly improved the liquidity and capital position of the company and allowed the company to restructure its balance sheet and operating structure 

table of contents during the third quarter of  after the completion of the recapitalization  in order to reduce interest rate risk  and based on existing market conditions  doral financial s newly constituted board of directors reassessed the third quarter reassessment the company s intent of holding available for sale securities until maturity or recovery of losses and approved the sale of approximately billion in available for sale investment securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors reassessed the fourth quarter reassessment the company s intent of holding held to maturity securities until maturity and approved the transfer of billion in investment securities from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the decision was made  based on existing market conditions  to provide the company with a greater ability to manage interest rate risk 
the company still had the ability and intent to hold these securities for a sufficient period of time to allow for the recovery of market value  but not necessarily until maturity 
subsequently  the company sold million of long dated us treasury securities for a gain 
net loss for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to net loss of million and net income of million for the years and  respectively 
compared to  doral financial s financial performance was principally impacted by lower net interest income as a result of a decrease in interest earnings assets  primarily investment securities  an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses due to the continued deterioration of the construction loan portfolio and the general rise in delinquencies  significant non interest losses driven primarily by i losses on the sale of investment securities  and ii a loss on extinguishment of liabilities  related to losses on the sale of investment securities  and partially offset by a reduction in non interest expense 
these resulted in a slight increase in the net loss before tax which was partially offset by an income tax benefit principally related to a decrease in the valuation allowance of the company s deferred tax assets 
important factors impacting the company s financial results for the year ended december  included the following the net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to net loss of million and a net income of million for the years and  respectively 
after the payment of preferred stock dividends  there was a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the diluted loss per share for the year ended december  was  compared to a diluted loss per share of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income for  compared to  is principally related to the decrease in interest income due to the sale of billion in available for sale investment securities 
this was partially offset by the reduction in interest expense related to the termination of the funding associated with the investment securities sold and to the repayment of million in senior notes on july  which was funded primarily from the million equity investment by doral holdings on july   reducing the leverage of doral financial 
this reduction in leverage also resulted in an increase in the net interest margin from for to for see tables a and b below for information regarding the company s net interest income 
average interest earning assets decreased from billion for to billion for the decrease in assets was offset by a decrease in interest bearing liabilities from billion for to billion for the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses reflects principally an increase in reserves related to the 
table of contents allowance for the company s construction loan portfolio  as well as increases in the provision to reflect delinquency trends in the residential mortgage  commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
non interest loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to non interest loss of million and non interest income of million in and  respectively 
the non interest loss for  compared to  was principally driven by a significant loss related to the third quarter sale of billion in available for sale investment securities and related transactions at a pre tax loss totaling approximately million  consisting of a loss of million on economic hedging transactions  a net loss on extinguishment of liabilities of million and a loss on sale of investment securities of million 
the sale of doral bank ny s branch network and a loss on related assets during the third quarter of also contributed to a charge of million  net of the million premium received on deposits sold 
commissions  fees and other income decreased by million primarily due to reduced income from a residential housing project in possession of the company 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
compared to  non interest expenses for decreased by million  principally due to the accrual of million during in connection with the settlement of the securities class action and shareholders derivative litigation related to the restatement of prior period financial statements 
non interest expenses for  increased by million compared to non interest expense for  adjusted for the million charge 
the company s expenses for were principally driven by charges related to its recapitalization and reorganization efforts  including i million in compensation and benefit expenses related to the termination of the stock options  payment of an escrow account maintained on behalf of the company s chief executive officer pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement  payment of the key employee incentive plan  and severance payments  ii million in professional services related to remediation of legacy issues  iii million in professional services for investment banking and other services  and iv million in legal expenses 
in addition  the company paid million in professional services related to doral holdings and incurred advertising and marketing expenses of million associated with doral s refreshed branding program 
for the year ended december   doral financial reported an income tax benefit of million  compared to a tax benefit of million for the comparable period 
the recognition of an income tax benefit reflects the release of the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset  primarily as a result of higher forecasted taxable income due to the recapitalization of the company and the implementation of certain strategies to generate future taxable income 
during the year ended december   the company had other comprehensive income of approximately million  compared to other comprehensive income of million and other comprehensive loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  the company incurred other comprehensive income due to the realization of the losses reflected in its accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income tax benefit of million at december  as a result of the sale of the billion in available for sale investment securities during the third quarter of as of december   the company s accumulated other comprehensive loss net of income tax benefit was million  compared to million as of december  doral financial s loan production for was billion  compared to billion for  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in doral financial s loan production was due to a number of factors  including changes in underwriting standards to reflect the deteriorating economic conditions in puerto rico  competition from other financial institutions and a general slow down in borrowing activity in puerto rico 
the company anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  these same factors will keep loan production below historical levels 
total assets as of december  were billion  a decrease of  compared to billion as of december  the decrease in total assets during was due primarily to a decrease in the company s securities portfolio of billion  as a result of the sales of 
table of contents billion and million in available for sale investment securities during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the sale and the cancellation of related borrowings used to finance these securities were completed on august  the decrease in total liabilities of billion was also driven by the repayment of the million in senior notes on july   largely from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock amounting to million 
internal control over financial reporting doral financial is engaged in the implementation of remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  doral financial s remediation efforts are outlined in remediation of material weaknesses under item a  controls and procedures  of this annual report on form k and are specifically designed to address the material weaknesses identified by doral financial s management and to enhance the company s overall corporate governance 
doral financial will disclose any significant developments arising as a result of its remediation efforts in future filings with the sec 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by management or employees in the normal course of their assigned functions 
material weaknesses in internal controls may also constitute deficiencies in the company s disclosure controls 
based on an evaluation of these material weaknesses  doral financial s current chief executive officer and its current chief financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in doral financial s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of these estimates are critical to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition since they are particularly sensitive to the company s judgment and are highly complex in nature 
doral financial believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  however  given the sensitivity of doral financial s consolidated financial statements to these estimates  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in doral financial s results of operations or financial condition 
various elements of doral financial s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by doral financial in the preparation of its financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurement the measurement of fair value is fundamental to the presentation of doral financial s financial condition and results of operations 
fair value is defined under gaap as the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
gaap indicates that fair value must be based on observable for example  quoted market prices 
if observable market prices are not available  the techniques management uses for estimating fair value measurements should incorporate assumptions that individuals in the market would use 
if that information is not available  then gaap permits an entity to use its own assumptions  as long as there is no indication that the market would use a different assumption 
doral financial recognizes many of its financial instruments at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  with changes in these fair values 
table of contents recognized as gains and losses in the consolidated statements of loss income or deferred  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
set forth below is a summary of doral financial s sources of fair value for its investment securities  held in the securities held for trading and available for sale portfolios as well as its derivatives  retained interests and loans held for sale as of december  carrying amount prices provided prices by other internal external actively external valuation valuation in thousands quoted sources models models tax exempt gnmas collateralized mortgage obligations puerto rico government obligations mortgage backed securities us treasury securities us government sponsored agency securities derivative instruments other investment securities interest only strips servicing assets msrs loans held for sale the market value of loans held for sale is generally based on quoted market prices for mortgage backed securities  adjusted to reflect particular characteristics such as guarantee fees  actual delinquency and credit risk associated with the individual loans 
fair value affects doral financial s earnings in a variety of ways 
for certain financial instruments that are carried at fair value such as securities held for trading  including ios and derivative instruments  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings as net gain loss on securities held for trading 
for securities available for sale  changes in fair value are generally deferred  net of tax  in aoci  a component of stockholders equity 
the deferred gains and losses in aoci  initially measured at fair value  are recognized in earnings over time when the securities are sold or when impairment is recognized 
in addition  impairment of loans held for sale is recognized in earnings through lower of cost or market valuation adjustments 
finally  changes in fair value of msrs are recognized in earnings as part of servicing income 
the estimation of fair values reflects doral financial s judgment regarding appropriate valuation methods and assumptions 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on both the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by a number of factors  such as type of instrument  the liquidity of the market for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
trading in the bond market is experiencing a disruption because of liquidity issues 
at the current time  doral financial believes that it has adequate liquidity resources to hold its available for sale securities until recovery of their value 
for financial instruments with active markets and readily available market prices  doral financial estimates fair values based on independent price quotations obtained from third parties  including dealer quotes or direct market observations 
dealer quotes are prices that are obtained from third party dealers that generally make markets in the relevant products 
the quoted price is an indication of the price at which the dealer would consider transacting in current market conditions 
direct market observations are prices that are retrieved from sources in which market trades are executed  such as electronic trading platforms 
certain instruments  such as the company s portfolio of los  are less actively traded and  therefore  fair value is based on valuation models using market data inputs adjusted by the company s particular characteristics  when appropriate 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 

table of contents gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  doral financial sells these securities for cash 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells for cash through broker dealers 
prior to  the company sold mortgage loans that did not conform to gnma  fnma or fhlmc requirements non conforming loans as whole loan pools to financial institutions 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
in connection with the sale of loans  generally non conforming mortgage loan pools  doral financial may also retain certain interests in the loans sold  such as the right to receive any interest payments on such loans above the contractual pass through rate payable to the investor 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the reported gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the security or mortgage loan pool and its allocated cost 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 
if in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  doral financial has not surrendered control over the transferred assets according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  doral financial accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral 
retained interest valuation in the past  doral financial s sale and securitization activities generally result in the recording of one or two types of retained interests  msrs and ios 
during  the company s sale and securitization activities resulted in the recording of only one type of retained interest  msrs 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
unlike us treasury and agency mortgage backed securities  the fair value of msrs and ios cannot be readily determined because they are not traded in active securities markets 
doral financial determined the initial fair value of its msrs based on a market valuation received from a third party 
the market valuation received for the company s entire servicing portfolio governmental  conforming and non conforming portfolios is calculated by stratifying the portfolio by predominant risk characteristics loan type and coupon 
under a market valuation approach  the fair value of the servicing assets is determined based on a combination of market information on trading activity msr trades and broker valuations  benchmarking of servicing assets valuation surveys and cash flow modeling 
the valuation of the company s msrs 
table of contents incorporate two sets of assumptions market derived assumptions for discount rates  servicing costs  escrow earnings rate  float earnings rate and cost of funds and market derived assumptions adjusted for the company s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior  for escrow balances  delinquencies and foreclosures  late fees  prepayments and prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   the msrs fair value declined million 
the company  upon remeasurement of the msrs at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for servicing of financial assets  recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings net of tax on january  for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount to bring the december  msr balance to the fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in  impairment charges were recognized through a valuation allowance for each individual stratum of servicing assets 
the valuation allowance was adjusted to reflect the amount  if any  by which the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum of loans being serviced exceeded its fair value 
any fair value in excess of the cost basis of the servicing asset for a given stratum was not recognized 
other than temporary impairment  if any  was recognized as a direct write down of the servicing asset  and the valuation allowance was applied to reduce the cost basis of the servicing asset 
the amortization of the msrs was based on an income forecast cash flow method 
the income forecast method was based on the forecasted cash flows determined by the third party market valuation and the amortization was calculated by applying to the carrying amount of the msrs the ratio of the cash flows projected for the current period to total remaining forecasted cash flow 
ios represent the estimated present value of the cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for expected losses and prepayments  as well as by the estimated market value of any embedded cap  if applicable after subtracting the interest rate payable to the investor  and a contractual servicing fee 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to million of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
prepayment assumptions and discount rates incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  independently verifiable  market data and statistically derived relationships between the company s and the fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 
to determine prepayment assumptions  doral financial calculates its prepayment forecasts based on the median of static prepayment forecasts by mortgage backed securities dealers obtained from bloomberg 
this median is then adjusted using a regression analysis that correlates the prepayment experiences of the company s non conforming loan portfolio with that of us mainland fnma mortgages 
to estimate the adjustment equation between the us mainland and the company s portfolio  the company calculates a quarterly constant prepayment rate cpr for each pool of its non conforming loan portfolio and compares it to that of a generic fnma pool with similar coupon and seasonality 
to mitigate risks of misestimating the equation  the company updates its regression analysis on a quarterly basis as new data become available 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the change in the cpr between and was principally attributable to a slowdown in prepayments experienced throughout as a result of less refinancing activity in puerto rico given higher rates and the recessionary environments 
the change in the cpr between and was principally attributable to a change in the composition of the variable io portfolio 
the io internal valuation model utilizes a z spread approach to calculate discount rates 
the z spread is the market recognized spread over the swap curve that takes into consideration additional yield 
table of contents requirements based on the risk characteristics of a particular instrument 
as a result  the discount rates used by the company in the valuation of its ios change according to their components  the swap curve and the z spread 
the z spread incorporates a premium for prepayment optionality and liquidity risk over the period end swap curve 
as a result of a review by management of current liquidity conditions in the puerto rico and us secondary market for non conforming loans  the liquidity premium incorporated in the model is basis points over the curve 
the spread was increased by basis points versus the inputs  principally reflecting the current conditions of the mortgage capital markets 
doral financial obtains the z spread from major investment banking firms 
this methodology resulted in a discount rate of for  for and for for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
doral financial recognizes as interest income the excess of the cash collected from the borrowers over the yield payable to investors  less a servicing fee retained spread  up to an amount equal to the yield on the ios that equals the discount rate used in the internal valuation model 
doral financial accounts for any excess retained spread as amortization to the gross io capitalized at inception 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 
the following table presents a detail of the cash flows received and the losses on the valuation of doral financial s portfolio of ids for  and based on the internal valuation model year ended december  in thousands total cash flows received on io portfolio amortization of ios  as offset to cash flows net cash flows recognized as interest income gain loss on the value of the ios as discussed above  doral financial classifies its ios as securities held for trading with changes in the fair value recognized in current earnings as a component of net gain loss on securities held for trading 
the following table shows the weighted averages of the key economic assumptions used by the company in its external and internal valuation models and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in those assumptions for mortgage loans at december  servicing interest only dollars in thousands assets strips carrying amount of retained interest weighted average expected life in years constant prepayment rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change residual cash flow discount rate weighted average annual rate decrease in fair value due to adverse change decrease in fair value due to adverse change these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is

in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments  which may magnify or offset the sensitivities 
the following table summarizes the estimated change in the fair value of the company s ios  the constant prepayment rate and the weighted average expected life under the company s valuation model  given several hypothetical instantaneous and parallel increases or decreases in interest rates 
as of december   all of the mortgage loan sale contracts underlying the company s floating rate ios were subject to interest rate caps  which prevent a negative fair value for the floating rate ios 
dollars in thousands constant weighted average change in fair change in interest prepayment expected life value of interest rates basis points rate years only strips change base the company s ios included in the table above are primarily variable rate ios  subject to interest rate caps 
accordingly  in a declining interest rate scenario as shown in the table  decreases in the fair value of the interest rate caps more than offset the otherwise positive impact that declining interest rates would have on the fair values of the ios 
this results in a net reduction in the fair values of the ios 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on securities held for trading includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  including derivative contracts  that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios and derivative instruments are based on dealer quotations from recognized markets 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
as of december   doral financial held million in puerto rico tax exempt gnma securities included in its securities held for trading portfolio 
because of their preferential tax status in puerto rico  these securities cannot be valued directly by reference to market quotations for us gnma securities with similar characteristics 
doral financial determines the fair value of its portfolio of tax exempt gnma securities  based on quotations from various dealers 
generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading in the consolidated statements of loss income 

table of contents other income recognition policies interest income on loans is accrued by doral financial when earned 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier if concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is fully reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of recovery 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible 
loan origination fees  as well as discount points and certain direct origination costs for loans held for sale  are initially recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the loan and reflected in doral financial s earnings as part of the net gain on mortgage loan sales and fees when the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the case of loans receivable held for investment  such fees and costs are deferred and amortized to income as adjustments to the yield of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risks inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
the company evaluates impaired loans and the related valuation allowance based on sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
doral financial measures impaired loans at their estimated realizable values determined by discounting the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  if practical  at the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in assessing the reserves under the discounted cash flows  the company considers the estimate of future cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
all available evidence  including estimated costs to sell if those costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan  are considered in developing those estimates 
the likelihood of the possible outcomes is considered in determining the best estimate of expected future cash flows 
doral financial s mortgage loan portfolio consists primarily of homogeneous loans that are secured by residential real estate and are made to consumers 
doral financial does not evaluate individual homogeneous loans for impairment 
instead  it records an allowance including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on an aggregate basis under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels and trends  as well as charge off and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 
estimated recourse obligation prior to  the company normally sold mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or 
table of contents any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
doral financial recognizes the fair value of its recourse obligation by estimating the amount that the company would be required to pay for mortgage insurance from a third party in order to be relieved of its estimated recourse exposure on these loans 
the company believes that this method resulted in an adequate valuation of its recourse allowance as of december   but actual future recourse obligations may be different and a different result may have been obtained if the company had used another method for estimating this liability  such as one requiring management to estimate this liability based on actual historical losses incurred by the company 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  to the extent necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the amount of the valuation allowance has been determined based on our estimates of taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
our methodology for determining the realizability of deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income for the company and of estimated operating expenses to support that anticipated level of business  as well as the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
income tax benefit or expense includes i deferred tax expense or benefit  which represents the net change in the deferred tax assets or liability balance during the year plus any change in the valuation allowance  if any  and ii current tax expense

in addition  the company paid million in professional services related to doral holdings and incurred advertising and marketing expenses of million associated with doral s refreshed branding program 
the decrease in interest income and the increase in non interest loss were offset in part by a tax benefit of million for  compared to million for the comparable period 
the recognition of an income tax benefit reflects the release of the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset  primarily as a result of higher forecasted taxable income due to the recapitalization of the company and the implementation of certain strategies to generate future taxable income 
compared to doral financial incurred a net loss of for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the results for reflected decreases in net income related primarily to the following factors a compression in the company s net interest margin  which resulted in a million  or  decrease in net interest income in compared to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses as a result of increases in specific reserves related to the allowance for the company s construction loan portfolio  as well as a deterioration in the delinquency trends of the overall loan portfolio  particularly in the company s construction and commercial portfolios 
a reduction in non interest income attributable to i a million loss on io valuation principally related to losses suffered during the first half of from the impact of increases in short term interest rates on ios that did not have caps on the pass through interest payable to investors  ii a loss of approximately million related to the sale of investment securities designed to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk  and iii losses of million on mortgage loan sales and fees principally attributable to a market value adjustment of million taken during the year in connection with the transfer of certain mortgage loans from the held for sale category to loans receivable 
mortgage loan sales and fees were also adversely impacted by a net loss of approximately million incurred in connection with the restructuring of certain mortgage loan transfer transactions with local institutions 

table of contents an increase in non interest expense  principally related to i a contingency provision of million recorded in connection with an agreement to settle the company s consolidated securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation related to the restatement of prior period financial statements  ii increases in professional fees related to the resolution of ongoing legacy issues and the company s business transformation and recapitalization efforts  and iii severance payments associated with a reduction in headcount 
the decreases in interest income and in non interest income were offset in part by a tax benefit of million for  compared to a tax expense of million for such tax benefit results from the company s loss position and from agreements signed during with the puerto rico treasury department 
net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest earned by doral financial on its interest earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  which results in lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates and higher net interest income in periods of declining short term interest rates 
refer to risk management below for additional information on the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
net interest income for the years  and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease in net interest income was principally due to a reduction in interest earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the reduction in average earning assets was principally related to the sale of billion in available for sale investment securities during as a result of the third and fourth quarters reassessments 
this reduction was partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities related to the termination of the funding associated with the investment securities sold and to the repayment of million in senior notes on july  the repayment of the senior notes was funded primarily from the million equity investment by doral holdings on july  this transaction caused a reduction in doral financial s leverage and resulted in the increase in the net interest margin 
the increase in net interest margin during  compared to  was due primarily to the recapitalization of the company and the sale of available for sale investment securities 
the recapitalization had the effect of replacing debt for equity therefore increasing the net interest margin 
the sale of available for sale investment securities also had the effect of increasing the net interest margin because the net spread between the assets and liabilities funding the assets was dilutive to the net interest margin and therefore the sale contributed positively to increasing the margin 
the decrease in interest earning assets reflects a decrease in the average balance of loans as a result of the sale  during the second quarter of  of approximately billion in mortgage loans as part of the restructuring of prior mortgage loan transfers that were recharacterized as secured borrowings as part of the 
table of contents restatement 
this sale also impacted the decrease in the interest bearing liabilities reflected in the average balance of the loans payable as a result of the repayment of the secured borrowings 
compared to doral financial s net interest income for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease in net interest income was principally due to the continued compression of the company s net interest spread and a reduction in the average balance of the company s interest earning assets 
doral financial s net interest spread and margin for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  the reduction in average earning assets reflects a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale as a result of sales during of approximately billion in mortgage loans as part of the restructuring of prior mortgage loan transfers that were recharacterized as secured borrowings as part of the restatement 
the decrease in average earning assets also reflects a decrease in the average balance of investment securities 
the company s current strategy is to gradually de emphasize investment securities from the company s balance sheet and retain more loans in its balance sheet 
this strategy is designed to reduce interest rate risk by reducing the gap between the repricing of its assets and its liabilities 
as part of this strategy  the company sold billion of lower yielding securities from its available for sale portfolio during the fourth quarter of and billion in available for sale securities during the fourth quarter of  of which million settled during the first quarter of the decrease in average earning assets also reflects the company s decision in august of to discontinue the practice of purchasing whole loans without the associated servicing rights for subsequent securitization into mortgage backed securities 
the decrease in net interest rate spread and margin for the year ended december   as compared with  was due primarily to increases in short term interest rates  at which liabilities re priced  that outpaced the increase in yield on interest earning assets 
the decrease in net interest rate spread was caused primarily by the following factors the higher cost of short term borrowings as a result of the federal reserve s tightening monetary policy  raising the federal funds target rate by basis points from october  to june   and leaving it at for the remainder of the compressed margin on the company s large portfolio of investment securities 
assuming a funding cost equal to the weighted average cost of the company s repurchase agreements  the average interest rate spread on the company s investment securities for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  a decrease in the current mismatch in the duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
this mismatch exposes the company to significant interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because  as these short term or callable liabilities re price at higher market rates  the company s interest rate margin is further compressed 
the company s interest rate exposure is further complicated by the negative convexity ie  the tendency for the average life of the company s assets to decrease through prepayments as interest rates decline inherent in the company s portfolio of fixed rate mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans 
the combination of this negative convexity and the current composition of the company s liabilities exposes the company to margin compression risks even in certain declining interest rate environments 
the decrease in interest income on ios  which was principally attributable to a significant decrease in the average principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying the outstanding ios as a result of the restructuring of certain mortgage loan sales during the first half of and  to a lesser extent  to increases in short term interest rates compared to increased deposits at doral financial s banking subsidiaries  including brokered deposits  coupled with a more competitive deposit environment  as well as increased costs of its repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the increase in cost of notes payable reflects the re pricing nature of most of the company s notes payable  which are floating rate notes indexed to month libor

income taxes income taxes include puerto rico income taxes as well as applicable federal and state taxes 
as puerto rico corporations  doral financial and all of its puerto rico subsidiaries are generally required to pay federal income taxes only with respect to their income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in the united states excluding puerto rico and certain investment income derived from us assets 
any such tax is creditable  with certain limitations  against puerto rico income taxes 
except for the operations of doral bank ny and doral money  substantially all of the company s operations are conducted through subsidiaries in puerto rico

doral financial also invests in us treasury and agency securities that are exempt from puerto rico taxation and are not subject to federal income taxation because of the portfolio interest deduction to which doral financial is entitled as a foreign corporation 
in addition  doral financial uses its international banking entity subsidiary to invest in various us securities and us mortgage backed securities  which interest income and gain on sale  if any  is exempt from puerto rico income taxation and excluded from federal income taxation on the basis of the portfolio interest deduction in the case of interest  and  in the case of capital gains  because the gains are sourced outside the united states

the pr code also includes an alternative minimum tax of that applies if the company s regular income tax liability is less than the alternative minimum tax requirements 
the provision for income taxes of the company differs from amounts computed by applying the applicable puerto rico statutory rate to income before taxes

the decrease in the tax provision for the year ended december  is principally related to the release of the valuation allowance of the deferred tax assets described below 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the expected realization of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  the company s ability to replace maturing brokered deposits and other sources of working capital at market rates  and tax planning strategies  in making this assessment 
the company determined that it is more likely than not that million of its deferred tax asset  related primarily related to net operating losses  will not be realized and maintained a valuation allowance for that amount 
benefits recognized for net operating losses are limited by the fact that under the pr code doral financial is not permitted to file consolidated tax returns and  thus  is not able to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary 
for the year ended december   net operating losses of million were created 
based on the forecasted future taxable income the company will not be able to obtain the full benefit of these net operating losses 
during  the company entered into two separate agreements with the puerto rico treasury department regarding the company s deferred tax asset related to prior intercompany transfers of ios the io tax asset 
the first agreement  executed during the first quarter  confirmed the previously established tax basis of all the io transfers within the doral financial corporate group 
the second agreement  executed during the third quarter  clarified that for puerto rico income tax purposes  the io tax asset is a stand alone intangible asset subject to a straight line amortization based on a useful life of years 
furthermore  the agreement provided that the io tax asset could be transferred to any entity within doral financial corporate group  including the puerto rico banking subsidiary 
the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the existence of  or generation of  taxable income during the remaining year amortization period years period in which the amortization deduction of the io tax asset is available 
in determining the valuation allowance recorded  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included projected earnings attributable to the core business through the projection period  repayment of the million in senior notes due to the recapitalization and which served to significantly reduce interest expense  results of the leveraging program  which includes loan growth of approximately billion through purchases of single family loans and the purchase of approximately billion in securities 
further positive evidence included the ability to isolate verifiable nonrecurring charges in historical losses  the core earnings of the business absent these nonrecurring items and the flexibility to move the io tax asset amortization to profitable entities according to doral financial s agreements with the puerto rico treasury department 
during the fourth quarter of  the company implemented certain tax planning actions in order to generate future taxable income that contributed to the reduction in its valuation allowance 
these include the transfer of substantially all of the assets from doral international to doral bank pr 
negative evidence included the company s recorded losses for the year ended december  and and the net short operating loss carry forward period of years  as well as uncertainty regarding its ability to generate future taxable income 
negative evidence also included the risks factors described in item a of this annual report on form k 

table of contents in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  we considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas as well as the risk factors related to its future business described above 
based on this analysis we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the company s gross deferred tax assets of million would not be realized 
as a result  the company recorded a valuation allowance 
at december   the deferred tax asset  net of its valuation allowance of million  amounted to approximately million compared to million at december  failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  a decline in margins and loss of market share 
during  doral financial s international banking entity subsidiary had a pre tax loss of million  compared to a pre tax benefit of million for this reduction was to due the sale of investment securities during as a result of the third quarter reassessment

the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
for the period ended december   the company recognized approximately million in interest and penalties 
unrecognized tax benefits as of december  amounted to million 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons  including changes in the amounts for current tax year positions  expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation  changes in management s judgment about the level of uncertainty  status of examinations  litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
the company s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by taxing authorities 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
any such adjustment could be material to our results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based  in part  upon the results of operations for the given period 
as of december   the statute of limitations for the years ended december   and remained open 
compared to for the year ended december   doral financial recognized an income tax benefit of million  compared to an income tax expense of million for the comparable period 
the decrease in the tax provision for the year ended december  was principally due to pre tax losses recognized during  combined with an increase in the company s net deferred tax asset as a result of agreements entered into with the puerto rico treasury department  which are described below 
during  the company entered into two separate agreements with the puerto rico treasury department regarding the company s deferred tax asset related to prior intercompany transfers of ios the io tax asset

furthermore  the agreement provided that the io tax asset may be transferred to any entity within the doral financial corporate group  including the puerto rico banking subsidiary 
the confirmation of the previously established tax basis of all io transfers within the doral financial corporate group and the ability to use the io tax asset in the company s profitable subsidiaries resulted in an increase in the deferred tax asset  net of the valuation allowance  and in a net tax benefit  for the year ended december  
table of contents in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

in assessing such projections  the company did not consider the effects of the proposed transaction  as part of the plans to pay its million floating senior notes that mature on july   as detailed in note to the financial statements 
the effects that the proposed transaction would have on the projections would be considered after the conclusion of the transactions leading to the payment of the senior notes 
in the case of the ios tax asset  the realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the existence of  or generation of  taxable income during the year period in which the amortization deduction is available 
in determining the valuation allowance recorded  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included projected earnings attributable to the core business through the projection period 
further positive evidence included the ability to isolate nonrecurring charges in historical losses and that it is objectively verifiable that such charges will not recur  core earnings of the business absent these nonrecurring items and the flexibility to move io amortization to profitable entities according to our agreements with the puerto rico treasury department 
negative evidence included our recorded loss for the year ended december   the net operating loss short carry forward period of years and the uncertainties surrounding the company s ability to continue as a going concern which at that moment was dependent on the ability to secure the needed outside financing for the payment of the million floating senior notes 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  we considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas as well as the risk factors related to its future business described above 
based on this analysis we concluded that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million would be realized 
under the pr code  doral financial is not permitted to file consolidated tax returns  thus  doral financial is not able to utilize losses from one subsidiary to offset gains in another subsidiary 
accordingly  in order to obtain a tax benefit from a net operating loss  a particular subsidiary must be able to demonstrate sufficient taxable income within the applicable carry forward period seven years under the pr code 
as of december   net operating losses of million were recognized at the subsidiary level that  based on the forecasted future taxable income  such subsidiaries could not utilize to offset future income 
this resulted in an increase of the valuation allowance 
at december   the deferred tax asset  net of its valuation allowance of million  amounted to approximately million  compared to million at december  failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to increased competition  a decline in margins and loss of market share 
during  pre tax income from doral financial s international banking entity subsidiary amounted to million  compared to million for refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes

for the years ended december    and  refinancing 
table of contents transactions represented approximately  and  respectively  of the total dollar volume of internally originated mortgage loans 
doral financial s future results could be adversely affected by a significant increase in mortgage interest rates that may reduce refinancing activity 
however  the company believes that refinancing activity in puerto rico is less sensitive to interest rate changes than in the mainland united states because a significant number of refinance loans in the puerto rico mortgage market are made for debt consolidation purposes rather than interest savings due to lower rates 
loan origination channels in puerto rico  doral financial relies primarily on doral bank pr s extensive branch network to originate loans 
it supplements these originations with wholesale purchases from other financial institutions 
purchases generally consist of conventional mortgage loans

in the past  doral financial attempted to mitigate the sensitivity of its servicing income to increases in prepayment rates by maintaining a strong retail origination network 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to enter into an economic hedge to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the market value of the msrs 
the company executed this hedge by purchasing million in year us treasuries at par value and placing the notes in the trading account

loans held for sale loans held for sale are carried on doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition at the lower of net cost or market value on an aggregate portfolio basis 
market values are determined by reference to market prices for comparable mortgage loans  adjusted by the portfolio credit risk

as of december   doral financial owned approximately million in loans held for sale  of which approximately million consisted of residential mortgage loans 
during  the company performed a review of its loans held for sale portfolio 
as a result of this review  the company reassessed its plan to sell certain of its mortgage portfolio classified as held for sale and transferred a total amount of billion of loans from the held for sale portfolio to its loan receivable portfolio  at lower of cost or market on an aggregated basis and no charge resulted 
gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option 
an offsetting liability is also recorded 
as of december   the portfolio of loans held for sale includes million related to gnma defaulted loans  compared to million as of december  loans receivable doral financial originates mortgage loans secured by income producing residential and commercial properties  construction loans  land loans  certain residential mortgage loans and other commercial and consumer loans that are held for investment and classified as loans receivable 
loans receivable are originated primarily through doral financial s banking subsidiary

the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale 
table of contents clauses  which give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of total loans receivable at december   as shown in the preceding table  which have fixed interest rates or which have floating or adjustable interest rates that have a contractual maturity of more than one year

unlike its portfolio of residential mortgage loans  which is comprised almost entirely of fixed rate mortgage loans  a significant portion of doral financial s construction  land  and other commercial loans classified as loans receivable carry adjustable rates 
at december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the decrease in the percentage of adjustable rate loans over the years was the result of the transfers of billion and million of residential mortgage loans from the held for sale portfolio to the loans receivable portfolio during and  respectively  resulting in the increase of the company s fixed rate portfolio 
also  the decrease in adjustable rate loans in the portfolio relates to the decrease in the construction loans portfolio 
the adjustable rate construction  commercial and land loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate 
future market factors may affect the correlation of the interest rate adjustment with the rate doral financial pays on the different funding sources used to finance these loans

investment and trading activities as part of its mortgage securitization activities  doral financial is involved in the purchase and sale of mortgage backed securities 
in the past  doral financial was also engaged in purchases and sales of whole loans and securities primarily through its international banking entity subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  doral financial made the determination to terminate its program of purchasing loans in bulk without the associated servicing rights 
at december   doral financial  principally through its banking subsidiaries  held securities for trading with a fair market value of million  approximately million of which consisted of puerto rico tax exempt gnma securities 
these tax exempt securities are generally held by doral financial for longer periods prior to sale in order to maximize the tax exempt interest received thereon 
securities held for trading are reflected on doral financial s consolidated 
table of contents financial statements at their fair market value with resulting gains or losses included in current period earnings as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading 
the fair values of doral financial s tax exempt gnma securities are based on quotes obtained from local broker dealers 
see critical accounting policies valuation of trading securities and derivatives above for additional information on how doral financial determines the fair values of its trading securities 
as part of its strategy to diversify its revenue sources and maximize net interest income  doral financial also invests in securities that are classified as available for sale  or prior to december  held to maturity 
as of december   doral financial  principally through its banking subsidiaries  held billion of investment securities that were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains or losses included in stockholders equity and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax expense benefit in doral financial s consolidated financial statements 
of this amount  approximately was held at doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
at december   doral financial had unrealized losses in aoci of million  compared to unrealized losses of million at december  related to its available for sale portfolio 
the company evaluates for impairment its investment securities at least quarterly or earlier if other factors indicative of potential impairment exist 
an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income is recognized when the decline in the fair value of the securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the company evaluates for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fas the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which requires that the company consider various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the expectations for the security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer  and the company s intention and ability to hold the security until maturity 
the unrealized losses in the company s investment securities are related to increases in interest rates and to adverse market conditions 
most of the company s securities are either u 
s government agency or mortgage backed securities that are highly rated 
moreover  the company understands that it has adequate liquidity at its banking subsidiaries  where most of the securities are held  to continue to hold these securities 
based on these factors  management has concluded that the existing impairments as of december  were temporary and no impairment charge was reported in the consolidated statements of income 
during the third quarter of  as a result of a reassessment  based on existing market conditions  the company sold billion in available for sale securities at a loss of million 
as part of this transaction  the related borrowings used to finance these securities were cancelled and losses of million on economic hedging transactions and of million on extinguishment of liabilities were recognized 
during the fourth quarter of  the company transferred its held to maturity portfolio  amounting to approximately billion  to the available for sale portfolio and subsequently sold million in long dated us treasury securities for a gain 
the sale was executed to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure 
management weighed certain factors in making the decision to transfer the securities from held to maturity to available for sale  and determined its revised interest rate risk parameters required greater flexibility in asset liability management 
since the transfer did not qualify under the exemption provisions for the sale or transfer of held to maturity securities under sfas  the reclassification decision by the company is deemed to have tainted the held to maturity category and it will not be permitted to classify prospectively any investment securities scoped under sfas as held to maturity for a period of two years 
the company recognized at the time of the transfer the unrealized loss on available for sale securities  net of taxes 
under current conditions  based on credit characteristics of investment portfolio  management s assessment is that the company has the intent and ability to retain its portfolio of investment securities until market recovery 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into various interest rate cap transactions to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with some assets purchases 
these transactions are intended to be economic hedges  but will be accounted for as trading account instruments

liquidity and capital resources doral financial has an ongoing need for capital to finance its lending  servicing and investing activities 
doral financial s cash requirements arise mainly from loan originations and purchases  purchases and holding of securities  repayments of debt upon maturity  payments of operating and interest expenses  servicing advances and loan repurchases pursuant to recourse or warranty obligations 
doral financial currently has and anticipates that it will continue to have adequate liquidity  financing arrangements and capital resources to finance its operations in the ordinary course of business 
impact of recapitalization of the holding company and restructuring of mortgage operations on liquidity on july   doral financial completed the private sale of  newly issued shares of common stock to doral holdings for an aggregate purchase price of million the recapitalization 
in connection with the recapitalization  on july   doral financial also transferred its mortgage servicing and mortgage origination operations to doral bank pr  its principal banking subsidiary  and on july   sold the branch network of doral bank ny 
in connection with these transactions  doral bank pr obtained regulatory approval to pay a million cash dividend to the holding company and doral bank ny received regulatory approval to effect a capital distribution to the holding company in the amount of million  of which million was paid on july  the transactions described above resulted in the significant recapitalization of the holding company and provided the holding company with sufficient funds to repay in full its million floating rate senior notes that matured on july   and to fund in august the settlement of the restatement related consolidated class action and derivative shareholder litigation and to pay related transaction expenses 
the transfer of the mortgage operation to doral bank pr has resulted in a more traditional operating structure in which most of the company s operational liquidity needs will be at the bank subsidiary level 
following the recapitalization and the related transactions described above  the holding company s principal uses of funds will be the payment of its obligations  primarily the payment of principal and interest on its debt obligations  and the payment of dividends on its preferred stock 
the holding company no longer directly funds any mortgage originating activities 
the principal sources of funds for the holding company are the interest income on the portfolio of mortgage loans and securities retained by the holding company and dividends from its subsidiaries  including doral bank pr and doral insurance agency 
the 
table of contents existing consent order with the federal reserve prohibits doral financial from receiving any dividends from doral bank pr without the prior written approval of the fdic 
various federal and puerto rico statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the company s banking and other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval 
no restrictions exist on the dividends available from doral insurance agency  other than those generally applicable under the puerto rico corporation law 
since april  doral financial has not paid dividends on the company s common stock 
liquidity of the banking subsidiaries doral financial s liquidity and capital position at the holding company differ from the liquidity and capital positions of the company s banking subsidiaries 
doral financial s banking subsidiaries rely primarily on deposits  short term borrowings under fhlb advances and repurchase agreements secured by pledges of their mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as their primary sources of liquidity 
to date  these sources of liquidity for doral financial s banking subsidiaries have not been materially adversely impacted by the development of adverse conditions in the us mortgage and credit markets 
uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mortgage backed securities programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require doral financial to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by doral financial under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for the decrease during was mainly related to the previously reported restructuring of various loan transfer transactions with local financial institutions during the second quarter of and new terms with respect to remittance schedules 
to the extent the mortgage loans underlying doral financial s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  doral financial would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in recent years  doral financial has sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by doral financial was million and million  respectively 
when doral financial sells mortgage loans to third parties it generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  investors are generally entitled to cause doral financial to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past doral financial s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and doral financial is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  doral financial s liquidity requirements would increase 
see off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
doral financial s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent doral financial does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   doral financial s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while deemed unlikely by doral financial  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of doral financial s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a material adverse effect on doral financial s liquidity and business

brokered deposits are used by doral financial s banking subsidiaries as a source of long term funds 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally very sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits

doral financial also derives liquidity from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc 
to the extent these programs are curtailed or the standard for insuring or selling loans under such programs is materially increased  or  for any reason  doral financial were to fail to qualify for such programs  doral financial s ability to sell mortgage loans and consequently its liquidity would be materially adversely affected

doral financial s contingent obligation with respect to such recourse provision is not reflected on doral financial s consolidated financial statements  except for a liability of 
table of contents million  as of december   for estimated losses from such recourse agreements  which is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities 
doral financial s current strategy is to sell loans on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early payment defaults 
in the past  the company has sold pools of delinquent loans on a servicing retained basis 
following these transactions  the loans are not reflected on doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
under these arrangements  as part of its servicing responsibilities  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments of principal and interest whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
for additional information regarding sales of delinquent loans refer to liquidity and capital resources above 
doral financial is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit and sell mortgage backed securities and loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position 
the contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit or for forward sales is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
doral financial uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
at december   commitments to extend credit and commercial and financial standby letters of credit amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  and commitments to sell mortgage backed securities and loans at fair value amounted to approximately million 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the contract are met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans 
if there is a breach of representations and warranties  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan

risk management doral financial s business is subject to four broad categories of risks interest rate risk  credit risk  operational risk and liquidity risk 
doral financial has adopted policies and procedures which have been designed to identify and manage risks to which the company is exposed specifically those relating to interest rate risk  credit risk  and operational risks 

table of contents interest rate risk management interest rate risk includes the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk also includes the risk that doral financial s net interest income from its loan and investment portfolio will change in response to changes in interest rates 
doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing long term shareholder value and minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility 
these policies are also designed to ensure the maintenance of adequate capitalization  liquidity  and other regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of interest rate and market risk to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee alco has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate and market risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  recommending for board approval asset liability and liquidity risk limits that are consistent with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for customer related activities  overseeing the company s secondary sales activities  monitoring compliance with risk limits and judging adequacy of the execution of tactics by the funds management group  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply  on a timely basis  the information and data necessary for the alco to fulfill its role as the company s asset liability manager 
risk identification and measurement doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  ios  and loans and securities holdings 
as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to better identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets and liabilities and sources of income  and has developed policies and procedures to better manage these risks 
doral financial continues to explore ways to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics net interest income sensitivity 
in determining the appropriate measure of doral financial s exposure to net interest income sensitivity  the company uses simulations to measure the risk of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income 
these simulations assume a static balance sheet  in which every maturing asset or liability is reinvested or refunded in the same type of instrument with the same tenor 
simulation modeling includes what if analyses to determine the effect of different interest scenarios on doral financial s risk profile and profitability 
the 
table of contents primary scenario used for risk measurement purposes is based on instantaneous changes in interest rates across contractual maturities 
in using these simulations  the company considers the impact of changes in interest rates on the interest rate spreads between deposits  cd rates  loans and investments  among others 
the impact of prepayment rates on loans and mortgage securities  interest rate caps and floors  and other options are also taken into account 
market value of equity 
while simulations can adequately assess short term interest rate risk  doral financial does not rely entirely on this tool to capture and identify the risks associated with longer term re pricing imbalances 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the non linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
leverage 
the company measures and monitors the company s leverage by targeting and setting limits to the following two ratios tangible equity to tangible assets  and risk based capital ratio 
yield curve twist 
under a normal yield curve  longer term interest rates are higher than shorter term rates 
a change of interest rates by the same amount along all maturities of the curve is called a parallel shift in the yield curve  since the shape of the curve stays the same  even though rates might be higher or lower across the curve 
a change in the yield curve where interest rates change differently for different terms of the curve is called a twist 
yield curve twist  also called rotation risk or yield curve risk  is the risk associated with non parallel rate shifts in the yield curve 
these changes in the shape of the yield curve are more commonly known as flattening or steepening 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is designed to reduce the volatility of the company s net interest income and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is being placed on balance sheet management 
at december   under the company s risk management strategy  the company s outstanding open derivative positions had decreased from to billion at december  to million at december  net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of strategies  which are adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
these techniques seek longer term funds through the use of long term repurchase agreements  fhlb ny advances and brokered deposits 
currently  the company mainly uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest 
market value of equity hedging strategies 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has exposure to rising rates 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities  the difference is what is termed market value of equity 
the company measures how this market value of equity fluctuates with different rate scenarios 
currently  the company s 
table of contents market value of equity drops when rates rise which is consistent with liability sensitive institutions 
management uses duration matching strategies to manage the fluctuations of market value of equity within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
in order to bring duration measures within the long term target of the company  management may use a combination of internal liabilities management techniques and derivative instruments 
doral financial primarily uses the following derivatives for such purposes interest rate swaps swaptions eurodollar futures treasury futures doral financial also enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities by setting the price in advance to protect the company against increases in interest rates and concurrent reductions in the price of mortgage backed securities 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
in order to bring convexity measures within the long term targets of the company  management primarily uses a combination of internal balance sheet management and the following derivatives swaptions call and put options on eurodollar futures put and call options on agency mortgage backed securities put and call options on treasury futures call options represent the right to buy a specified security at a specified price in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates fall 
put options represent the right to sell a specified security in the future 
their value generally increases as interest rates rise 
these instruments enable the company to hedge against adverse changes in market value of equity due to unexpected movements in interest rates  taking into consideration the duration and interest rate sensitivity of the company s loan and investment portfolio 
doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and is periodically reviewed by the board of directors 
management manages the interest risk profile of the company by using natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet during the natural course of business operations and through active hedging activities using debt and derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the interest rate risk exposure can be segregated into linear and non linear risk components based on the varying changes to the market value of equity due to changes in interest rates 
the linear risk is managed through interest rate swaps and term funding 
the non linear risk arises primarily from embedded optionality in our products and transactions which allows clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of non linear risks include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured transaction 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other 
table of contents active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mortgage backed securities 
the tables below show the risk profile of doral financial taking into account the derivatives set forth below under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases or decreases of interest rates  as of december  and market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps market value net interest as of december  of equity risk income risk bps bps based on a month forward change in net interest income 
the reduced earnings volatility in both the sensitivity measures from december  to december   is due primarily to the active management of the balance sheet 
during the third quarter of  the company sold billion in available for sale investment securities and unwound the associated wholesale funding 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold million in long dated us treasury securities and reinvested the proceeds in shorter term instruments 
the combination of these actions with the reduction in leverage due to the repayment of the million senior notes on july  from the proceeds of the recapitalization transaction has helped reduce interest rate risk the recapitalization also had the effect of reducing a substantial amount of floating rate debt which played a major part in the sensitivity of the net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the following table shows the company s investment portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the table below assumes parallel and instantaneous increases and decreases of interest rates as of december  and december  in thousands as of december  as of december  change in fair change in change in fair change in value of fair value of value of fair value of available for held to available for held to change in yield sale securities maturity sale securities maturity curve basis points and fhlb stock securities and fhlb stock securities base doral financial s balance sheet includes a billion portfolio of long term investment securities with fixed interest rates  mostly mortgage backed and us treasury securities 
these securities were purchased as part of prior management s strategy to maximize tax exempt income 
the investment portfolio was mostly financed with short term or callable liabilities 
in a steep yield curve environment  the strategy increased net interest income but exposed the company to higher interest rate risk from increasing rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 

table of contents because of the current composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company believes that its net interest margin over a year horizon would compress in certain rising or declining interest rate environments  assuming parallel and instantaneous increases or decreases of interest rates 
under certain rising interest rate scenarios  the duration of the company s fixed rate mortgage loans and securities would extend and the company would be locked into lower yielding assets for longer periods 
at the same time  due to the callable features of the company s liabilities  the duration of the company s callable liabilities would shorten and the company would have to refinance its liabilities at higher rates 
under certain declining interest rate scenarios  the duration of the company s fixed rate mortgage loans and securities would shorten as mortgage refinancings increased this tendency is referred to as negative convexity and the company would have to reinvest principal prepayments at lower rates 
conversely  the duration of the company s callable liabilities would extend  as lenders would not exercise such options  and the company would be locked into higher borrowing rates 
the company  with the help of financial advisers  is examining alternatives to restructure its balance sheet in order to enhance the company s future earnings potential and to reduce the high level of interest risk and volatility inherent in its balance sheet 
the company sold billion in available for sale investment securities during the second half of as part of its efforts to reduce its interest rate risk 
derivatives 
as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate caps agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate caps agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the company s interest rate caps outstanding at december  table v interest rate caps dollars in thousands notional maturity entitled payment premium fair amount date conditions paid value september  month libor at september  month libor at september  month libor at october  month libor at october  month libor at october  month libor at november  month libor at november  month libor at november  month libor at the company is subject to various interest rate swaps agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps 
in the future  the company will seek hedge accounting treatment for these transactions in order to minimize mark to market volatility

doral financial uses derivatives to manage its market risk and generally accounts for them on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on securities held for trading as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the over the counter market are determined by prices provided by external sources or valuation models 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and billion  respectively  as of december  and notional amounts indicate the volume of derivatives activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
historically  the high volume of derivatives used by doral financial was associated with the company s economic hedging strategy 
doral financial s current risk management strategy is more focused on internal balance sheet management and the use of interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes 
the increased focus on internal balance sheet management has resulted in a smaller volume of derivatives 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged using the strict hedge accounting guidelines 
the notional amounts for swaps treated under hedge accounting totaled million as of december  there were no derivatives treated under hedge accounting as of december  typically the company uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate fhlb advances to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases the company matches all of the terms in the fhlb advance to the floating leg in the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and  when appropriate  obtains collateral 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivatives contracts used for interest risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements 
the credit risk associated with futures contracts is also limited due to daily cash settlement of the net change in the value of open contracts with the exchange on which the contract is traded

for the year ended december   the company recognized a realized gain of million and an unrealized loss of million from a derivative resulting from certain gain sharing agreements created in connection with certain mortgage loan sales 
the company has the right to share  on a limited basis  the gains realized by the buyers of such loans within specified time periods from subsequent sales or securitizations 
credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk with respect to its portfolio of loans receivable 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  doral financial is at risk for the term of the loans 
loans secured by income producing residential and commercial properties involve greater credit risk because they are larger in size and more risk is concentrated in a single borrower 
the properties securing these loans are also more difficult to liquidate in foreclosure 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or packages it into a mortgage backed security 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is fully insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
loan to value ratios for residential mortgage loans  excluding fha va loans  generally do not exceed for certain qualifying home purchase transactions  unless private mortgage insurance is obtained 
in the ordinary course of business  prior to  the company sold loans on a recourse basis 
when the company sells a loan with recourse  it commits  if the loan defaults  to make payments to remedy the default or to repurchase the defaulted loan 
see off balance sheet activities above for more information regarding recourse obligations 
the company has generally discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payment defaults 

table of contents because most of doral financial s loans are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  doral financial is subject to credit risks tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
for example  if puerto rico s real estate market were to experience an overall decline in property values  the company s rates of loss on foreclosure would increase 
a number of key economic indicators suggest that the puerto rico economy suffered a slowdown in and a further slowdown in  as a result of  among other things  high levels of oil prices  the depreciation of the dollar and the deceleration of public investment due to the commonwealth s current fiscal situation 
doral financial expects that the economy will not recover during  but rather continue to deteriorate 
the macroeconomics in puerto rico has and is expected to continue to affect the company s credit quality and delinquency trends 
doral financial has historically provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers for residential housing projects 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targeted developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
during the year ended december   doral financial entered into million of commitments to disburse construction loans  compared to million for the following table presents further information on the company s construction portfolio 
in thousands as of december construction loans total undisbursed funds under existing commitments construction loans  past due more than days construction loans  classified as substandard  but not more than days in arrears total non performing construction loans net charge offs construction loans allowance for loan losses construction loans non performing construction loans to total construction loans allowance for loan losses construction loans to total construction loans net charge offs to total construction loans includes million and million of construction loans for residential housing projects as of december  and  respectively 
also includes million and million of construction loans for commercial  condominiums and multi family projects as of december  and  respectively 
the construction loan portfolio decreased by during as a result of the incorporation of stricter standards during the second half of the year and the regular portfolio run off 
the construction loan portfolio is directly affected by the deterioration in the overall puerto rico economy because the underlying loans repayment capacity is dependent on the ability to attract home purchasers and maintain housing prices 
the construction industry in puerto rico has been greatly affected by the negative macro economic trends 
specifically  it has been adversely affected by a slowdown in the demand for new housing 
during  the company s portfolio experienced a significant increase in default rates resulting from borrowers not being able to sell finished units within the loan term 
non performing construction loans increased by million for compared to period 
at december  and  and of the loans within the construction portfolio were considered non performing loans  respectively 
although the company is taking several steps to mitigate the credit risk underlying these loans  their ultimate performance will be affected by each borrower s ability to complete the project  maintain the pricing level of the housing units within the project  and sell the inventory of units within a reasonable timeframe 
as a result of the negative outlook on the puerto rico economy and especially how it affects the construction industry  the company has ceased financing new construction of single family residential and commercial real estate

as a result  management expects that the amount of loans and exposure to the construction industry will continue to decrease throughout and subsequent years 
the residential mortgage portfolio increased by billion in this increase is principally related to the transfer of billion of loans from the mortgage loans held for sale portfolio to the loans receivable portfolio during the residential mortgage portfolio is affected by the deterioration in the puerto rico economy but to a lesser extent than the construction portfolio 
doral financial does not hold a significant amount of adjustable interest rate  negative amortization  or other exotic credit facilities that are common in other parts of the united states 
substantially all residential mortgage loans are fixed rate  regular amortizing loans 
the credit risk of the residential mortgage portfolio is affected by a deteriorating economy to the extent that the borrowers spending capacity is decreased and  as a result  may not be able to make their payments as due 
a deteriorating economy could also lead to a decline in real estate values and therefore the reduction of the borrowers capacity to refinance and the exposure to loss upon default 
loss mitigation strategies as a result of the increase in non performing loans during  the company developed several initiatives to mitigate credit losses 
mitigation strategies were rooted on the transfer of the collection function to the risk management organization reporting directly to the chief risk officer 
during  the company established a formal loan workout function within the collections group 
the function s main responsibilities are avoiding defaults and minimizing losses upon default of commercial and construction loans 
the group utilizes relationship officers  collection specialists and attorneys 
in the case of residential construction projects  the workout function monitors project specifics  such as project management and marketing  as deemed necessary 
as part of its credit losses mitigation strategy  the company has made a significant effort to speed the residential mortgage foreclosure process 
doral financial s strategy for minimizing losses upon the sale of foreclosed properties is based on minimizing the time it takes to foreclose a property and  therefore  the depreciation in value of vacant property for example  due to vandalism and the cost of improvements prior to the sale 
actions taken to accelerate the foreclosure process included the hiring of attorneys and legal staff to bring the process in house 
non performing assets and allowance for loan and lease losses non performing assets consist of loans on a non accrual basis and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days  or if the loan is classified substandard 
when the loan is placed on non accrual  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed 
such interest  if collected  is credited to income in the period of the recovery  and the loan returns to accrual when the principal and interest income become current and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for the year ended december   and  doral financial would have recognized million  million and million  respectively  in additional interest income had all delinquent loans been accounted for on an accrual basis 
the increase in non performing loans during was driven by the deterioration of economic conditions in puerto rico 
non performing residential mortgage loans increased by million or 
the delinquency in the residential mortgage portfolio is affected by doral financial s recourse obligations 
the portfolio includes loans that  at some point were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations and  as a result  have a higher credit risk 
the increase in the delinquency of construction loans portfolio was mainly driven by delays in the underlying projects 
these were partially due to delays in construction and the process of obtaining 
table of contents governmental permits  but primarily by weaker sales of the housing units 
during  the company noticed a marked reduction in the demand for new housing 
the increase in construction non performing loans included the downgrade of key relationships with an aggregate million in unpaid balance during december the facilities  in both cases  were granted for projects that experienced worse than expected demand  and were therefore  reduced in size

also excludes million  of days past due fha va loans as of december   which were not considered non performing assets by doral financial because the principal balance of these loans is insured or guaranteed under applicable fha and va programs and interest is  in most cases  fully recovered in foreclosure proceedings 
under the new estimates  which were modified during the first quarter of  all fha va loans days past due are placed in non accrual and therefore considered non performing assets 
during the first quarter of  the company changed its estimates for non accrual loans as a result of conforming the non accrual policies of its mortgage banking units to that of its banking subsidiaries  pursuant to which mortgage loans held for sale are placed on a non accrual basis after they are delinquent for more than days 
prior to  mortgage loans held for sale by doral financial s mortgage banking units were placed on a non accrual status if they had been delinquent for more than days to the extent that the loan to value ratio indicated concern as to the collectibility of the loan 
from the second quarter of until  loans held for sale by the company s mortgage banking units were placed on a non accrual basis after they were delinquent for more than days to the extent that the loan to value ratio indicated that there was a concern as to ultimate collectibility of the loan 
during and  the company reclassified billion and million  respectively  from its loans held for sale portfolio to its loans receivable portfolio 
refer to non performing asset and allowance for loan and lease losses above for additional information regarding the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the proportion of the allowance for loan losses allocated to the residential mortgage loans portfolio historically has been lower than in other lending portfolios 
a substantial part of the amounts due on delinquent residential mortgage loans has been historically recovered through 
table of contents sale of the property after foreclosure or negotiated settlements with borrowers 
for purposes of comparability with the industry  the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total non performing loans excludes the allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans from the numerator and the total residential mortgage loans portfolio and other non performing loans held for sale from the denominator 
doral financial believes that the value of the oreo reflected on its consolidated statements of financial condition represents a reasonable estimate of the properties fair values  net of disposition costs 
the fair value of the oreo is normally determined on the basis of internal and external appraisals and physical inspections

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
commercial and construction loans over million that are classified as substandard are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  the creditor is required to measure the impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals 
updated appraisals are obtained when the company determines that loans are impaired 
should the appraisal show a deficiency  the company records a specific reserve for the underlying loan 
during  the company requested and received several appraisals of real estate properties used as collateral on several of the portfolio s construction and commercial loans 
in general  the appraisals disclosed values lower than the values previously disclosed by earlier appraisals 
the loan loss provision for includes the incorporation of such appraisals in the calculation of the specific reserves as well as an estimate of the depreciation in value of the real estate collateral in the rest of the portfolios impaired collateral dependent loans 
the majority of the decrease in collateral values occurred during the fourth quarter of as the supply of housing units in construction is perceived to be greater than the demand 
this decline had a major impact on the provision for the quarter ended december  as collateral values of some of the loan within the construction portfolio fell sharply resulting in the need for additional reserves 
during the year ended december   doral financial evaluated a total of approximately million of construction and commercial loans for impairment for which there are specific allowances amounting to approximately million 
doral financial records an allowance for small balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages  consumer  commercial and construction loans under million on an aggregated basis under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
for such loans  the allowance is determined considering the historical charge off experience of each loan category and delinquency levels as well as charge off and delinquency trends and economic data  such as interest rate levels  inflation and the strength of the housing market in the areas where the company operates 

table of contents the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s portfolio of loans  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated specific and general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
loans deemed by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is sufficient  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the expectations used by doral financial in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses 
operational risk operational risks include the potential for financial losses resulting from failed or inadequate controls 
operational risks are inherent in every aspect of business operations  and can result from a range of factors including human judgments  process or system failures  or business interruptions 
operational risks are present in all of doral financial s business processes  including financial reporting 
overview of operational risk management doral financial is in the process of instituting an operational risk management program which will encompass the use of a more structured approach for the identification  assessment  measurement  mitigation  monitoring and reporting of events that may have an impact on doral financial s exposure to operational risk 
the proposed framework defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  systems  or from external events 
on july   doral financial announced the appointment of a corporate wide chief risk officer  who is responsible for implementing the process of managing the risks faced by the company 
the chief risk officer will coordinate with the company s internal audit group on risk identification and monitoring throughout doral financial 
in addition  the internal audit function will provide support to ensure compliance with doral financial s system of policies and controls and to ensure that adequate attention is given to correct issues identified

general business  economic and political conditions the company s business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength of the puerto rico and us economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
the economy of puerto rico appears to continue to underperform the us economy 
in its monthly index of economic activity  the puerto rico planning board registered a decrease on a monthly basis in june furthermore  the commonwealth s fiscal situation still poses challenges for growth 
in particular  general fund revenue and sales tax receipts are below projections  increasing the risk that additional revenue raising initiatives will be required to balance the budget

the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic  legislative  regulatory and technological changes 
the company faces competition in such areas as mortgage and banking product offerings  rates and fees  and customer service 
in addition  technological advances and increased e commerce activities have  generally  increased accessibility to products and services for customers which has intensified competition among banking and non banking companies in the offering of financial products and services  with or without the need for a physical presence 
miscellaneous changes in accounting standards adopted in the financial statements accounting for servicing of financial assets 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas 
this statement amends sfas with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities 
this statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract  requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits en entity to choose between an amortization method or a fair value measure for subsequent recognition for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities  at its initial adoption  permits a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the statement of financial position  and additional disclosures 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s first fiscal year that begins after september  
table of contents earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  for any period of that fiscal year 
the adoption of this statement on january  did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company  upon the valuation of the msrs at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings net of tax of  as of the beginning of the fiscal year for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount to bring the msr balance as of december  to fair value 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
under the interpretation  the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts  but without considering time values 
fin is applicable to all uncertain positions for taxes accounted for under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and is not intended to be applied by analogy to other taxes  such as sales taxes  value added taxes  or property taxes 
significant elements of the new guidance include the following recognition a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
measurement the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
change in judgment the assessment of the recognition threshold and the measurement of the associated tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
unrecognized tax benefits should be recognized in the period that the position reaches the recognition threshold  which might occur prior to absolute finality of the matter 
similarly  recognized tax benefits should be derecognized in the period in which the position falls below the threshold 
interest penalties a taxpayer is required to accrue interest and penalties that  under relevant tax law  the taxpayer would be regarded as having incurred 
accordingly  under fin  interest would start to accrue in the period that it would begin accruing under the relevant tax law  and penalties should be accrued in the first period for which a position is taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return that would give rise to the penalty 
how a company classifies interest and penalties in the income statement is an accounting policy decision 
the company should disclose that policy and the amounts recognized 
disclosures fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures  including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next months  a description of open tax years by major jurisdictions  and a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits  presented as a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the unrecognized tax benefits on a worldwide aggregated basis 
after considering other applicable guidance such as the guidance that the emerging issues task force specifies in issue  uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination  a company should record the change in net assets that results from the application of fin as an adjustment to retained earnings 

table of contents the company adopted fin effective january  as a result of the adoption  the company recorded an adjustment to retained earnings amounting to million 
the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
for the period ended december   the company recognized approximately million in interest and penalties 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
in june  the emerging issues tax force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
the provisions of eitf will be effective for the company as of january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

sfas amends sfas to simplify the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments a hybrid financial instrument by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise required bifurcation  provided that the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
sfas also establishes the requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  which replaces the interim guidance in dig issue d sfas amends sfas to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to beneficial interests other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september  earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements for any period of the fiscal year

noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fas  noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amended of arb no 
 which establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
on december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations 
the significant changes upon adoption of sfas are the definition  classification and measurement of noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest 
sfas define noncontrolling interest as the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable to a parent 
further establish the presentation of the noncontrolling interest within the equity section of the statement of financial position separately from parent s equity and should be clearly identified to distinguish it from other components of the parent s equity 
sfas clarifies that all earnings and losses of the subsidiary should be attributed to the parent and the noncontrolling interest  even if the attribution of losses results in a debit balance in stockholders equity 
in addition sfas provides that upon a loss of control deconsolidation  any gain or loss on the interest sold will be recognized in earnings 

table of contents sfas applies to all fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  calendar year end public companies will have to adopt sfas in the fist quarter of earlier application in not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of the adoption of this statement on its financial statements  commencing on january  business combinations 
on december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
and applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity the acquirer obtains control of one or more business 
sfas revised retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the acquisition method of accounting purchase method be used for all business combinations 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control in the business combination and requires the acquirer to be identified 
sfas revised requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
in addition  this statement expands and improves the information reported about assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies 
contingencies arising from a business combination should be recognized as of the acquisition date  measured at their acquisition date fair values 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period on or after december  earlier application in not permitted 
the effective date of this statement is the same as that of the related sfas statement no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of the adoption of this statement on its financial statements  commencing on january  fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
therefore  the definition focuses on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability at the measurement date an exit price  not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
this statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  this statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
in those situations  the reporting entity need not undertake all possible efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions 
however  the reporting entity must not ignore information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available without undue cost and effort 

table of contents this statement expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
the disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value and for recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs within level of the fair value hierarchy  the effect of the measurements on earnings or changes in net assets for the period 
this statement encourages entities to combine the fair value information disclosed under this statement with the fair value information disclosed under other accounting pronouncements  including fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  where practicable 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of the adoption of this statement on its financial statements  commencing on january  issuer s accounting for a previously bifurcated conversion option in a convertible debt instrument
