 fair value measurements sfas  which provides guidance for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities  as well as requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
during  the company accrued for legal costs associated with certain litigation 
the company believes these accruals are adequate to cover the legal fees and expenses associated with litigating these matters 
however  the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what the company has projected 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments 
on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors and the assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts and determines when to grant credit to its customers using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition  recent payment history  current economic environment  and discussions with appropriate company personnel and with the customers directly 
accounts are written off when it is determined the receivable will not be collected 
if circumstance change  the company s estimates of the collectibility of amounts could be changed by a material amount 
the company determines inventory valuation reserves based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific problem in the valuation of a certain item  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the item to its net realizable value 
the company also recognizes reserves based on the actual usage in recent history and projected usage in the near term 
if circumstances change eg  lower than expected or higher than expected usage  estimates of the net realizable value could be materially impacted 

table of contents the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating its actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is more likely than not  does not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
pension plan benefits are expensed as applicable employees earn benefits 
the recognition of expenses is significantly impacted by estimates made by management such as discount rates used to value certain liabilities and expected return on assets 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with pension plan benefits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  pension plan expenses could be materially impacted the company assesses the impairment of its long lived identifiable assets  excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in the company s business plan could materially affect its evaluations 
no such changes are anticipated at this time 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis by applying a fair value test 
forward looking statements the statements in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report on form k that are forward looking are based upon current expectations  and actual results or future events may differ materially 
therefore  the inclusion of such forward looking information should not be regarded as a representation by the company that the objectives or plans of the company will be achieved 
such statements include  but are not limited to  the company s expectations regarding future revenues  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating income  net income  research and development expenses  effective tax rate  capital expenditure levels  availability of equity and debt financing and the company s ability to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
words such as anticipates  believes  intends  expects  should and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained herein involve numerous risks and uncertainties  and there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ materially  including  but not limited to  the following changing economic  market and business conditions  acts of war or terrorism  the effects of governmental regulation  the impact of competition and new technologies  slower than anticipated introduction of new products or implementation of marketing strategies  implementation of new manufacturing processes or implementation of new information systems  the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  changes in the prices of raw materials  changes in product mix  intellectual property and product liability claims and product recalls  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and the loss of any significant customers 
in addition  assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic review which may cause the company to alter its marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which in turn may affect the company s results of operations and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the company is not exposed to material fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the payments from the company s international customers are primarily received in united states dollars 
principal and interest rate risk the company has an investment portfolio that is invested with a major financial institution in a municipal money market fund that is aaa rated 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income it receives from its investments without significantly increasing risk 
in general  the primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of and the return on the investment to fluctuate 
although the returns on money market funds fluctuate with changes in interest rates  the principal should not generally be subject to market risk 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities do not have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
however  the company cannot provide complete assurance that its investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value
