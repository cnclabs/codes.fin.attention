item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except per share data the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we operate the leading frequent dining programs in north america by marketing our participating restaurants to members of these programs and by providing incentives to members to dine at these restaurants 
thousands of restaurants benefit from these marketing efforts and frequent dining programs  as well as the business intelligence  member comments and ratings and access to capital that we offer 
in addition to operating the frequent dining program of leading airline frequent flyer programs  clubs and other affinity organizations  we offer our own frequent dining program through our website  www 
rewardsnetwork 
com 
we market participating restaurants to members principally through the internet and email 
we offer business intelligence to participating restaurants by providing aggregate data regarding members activity and member feedback through comments and ratings gathered from surveys 
we also seek to increase the frequency of dining and amount spent on dining by members at participating restaurants by providing incentives to members to dine at participating restaurants  including airline miles  college savings rewards  reward program points  and cashback rewards savings 
we provide access to capital by purchasing a portion of future member transactions from participating restaurants in bulk and in advance 
bars and clubs also participate in our programs  and for purposes of describing our business  are included when we use the term restaurants 
we are paid for our services and  if applicable  receive the portion of a member s transaction that we have purchased only if a member dines at a participating restaurant when rewards are available and pays using a payment card that the member has registered with us 
our revenue is equal to a percentage of the member s total dining transaction amount 
these revenues are applied to recover our costs where we have purchased a portion of future member transactions  provide rewards to members  cover our selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  and generate operating income that provides a return for our stockholders 
we primarily offer two programs to restaurants our marketing services program and marketing credits program 
we market restaurants that participate in the marketing services program to members  offer incentives to members to dine at these restaurants and provide these restaurants with business intelligence on member activity and member feedback 
in addition to these services  we provide restaurants that participate in the marketing credits program with access to capital by purchasing a portion of future member transactions 
in discussing our business  we continue to use the term dining credits to refer to the portion of future member transactions that we purchase 
our contracts include a separate fee for marketing  business intelligence  member feedback and frequency programs 
we include all components of the marketing credits program  including the payment for marketing  business intelligence  member feedback and frequency programs  in marketing credits program sales and revenues because we analyze our business in this manner 
during  we focused on increasing both the number of restaurants that participate in our programs and the size of our dining credits portfolio 
we believe that a larger base of restaurants and larger portfolio of dining credits should result in increased revenues over time 
our efforts during to increase merchant count and the dining credits portfolio were supported by developing and maintaining an adequately staffed sales force and changes in our dining credits purchase policies designed to increase the amount of dining credits we purchase from select restaurants 
as a result of our focused efforts  we saw consistent quarterly increases in sales  merchant count and our dining credits portfolio throughout sales force 
during the fourth quarter of  we added to our sales force in an effort to increase the number of restaurants participating in our programs 
we maintained an adequately staffed sales force throughout newly hired sales employees typically take six months to be reasonably effective 
we saw an increase in the number of restaurants and improved revenues during the later half of as the sales force became more effective 
we believe the staffing levels and productivity of our sales force contributed to the increase in the number of restaurants participating in our programs 
dining credits purchase policies 
during  we increased the amount of dining credits that we purchased from select restaurants that met our due diligence and risk assessment requirements 
by purchasing more dining credits  we lengthen the period of time it takes to use the dining credits at that restaurant 
increasing the amount of dining credits purchased from select restaurants was designed to increase retention of desirable restaurants without sacrificing the risk profile of the dining credits portfolio 
during  our net dining credits usage period increased from months at the beginning of the year to months at the end of the year 
the lengthening of the dining credits usage period for select restaurants contributed to an increase in our dining credits portfolio 
we continually evaluate our dining credits purchase policies by monitoring the performance of our dining credits portfolio and observing current economic trends facing the restaurant industry 
toward the end of  we began to shorten the dining credits usage period for many of our deals 
in analyzing the appropriate length of the dining credits usage period for a restaurant  we consider the overall economic condition of the restaurant industry  the performance of participating restaurants generally and the individual restaurant s credit profile or business experience 
we shorten the dining credits usage period by purchasing fewer dining credits  which reduces the size of our dining credits portfolio 
also  if we purchase fewer dining credits from a restaurant  the restaurant may leave our program earlier 
on an aggregate basis  shortening this timeframe may result in fewer restaurants in our program 
it also means that we must spend more time to retain restaurants in our programs 
purchasing fewer dining credits also reduces the total revenue that we may realize from that deal  and if we are unable to renew that deal or enter into other new deals to replace that deal  our revenues may decline 
rcr loans product 
in march  we began to provide access to capital through a loan product  called rcr loans 
the rcr loan product provided restaurants with access to capital but did not provide marketing  business intelligence  member feedback or frequent dining programs 
we marketed and serviced the rcr loans on behalf of webbank  a non affiliated fdic insured  state chartered industrial bank 
we believed the product would be attractive to merchants who would not otherwise participate in our marketing credits program and the rcr loan product did increase the number of merchants that participate in our programs 
the development of the rcr loan program required significant investment of management time and alteration of our standard processes and procedures 
we deployed cash for the purchase of rcr loan notes and as a result the rcr loan product impacted our capital resources as well as our provision for losses 
after analyzing the product line s performance in light of its operational complexity  we decided in december to discontinue this business to allow our sales force to focus on continuing to grow our two core products  the marketing services program and the marketing credits program 
we discontinued offering the product line effective january  although we continue to service rcr loan notes that we previously purchased 
the balance of the net rcr loan portfolio was  as of december  and was not material to our operations in the cost to discontinue the rcr loan program recorded in the fourth quarter of was although the number of participating restaurants and the dining credits portfolio increase during  revenues declined in comparison to we increased the number of restaurants participating in our programs from  to  during  a increase 
we also increased our net dining credits portfolio from  to  during  a increase 
despite these increases  revenues for were  as compared to revenues of  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was due mainly to a shift in sales mix from marketing credits program merchants to marketing services program merchants early in during the second half of  we initiated efforts to change the mix back towards the marketing credits program merchants in an effort to increase revenues 
in addition  although year end merchant count increased by  the number of merchants participating in our programs during the first six months of was lower than the number of merchants participating in our programs during the first six months of  which also contributed to lower revenue during as compared to during  we experienced a decline in average revenue per merchant due to a decrease in member activity and the management of our members share of individual restaurants business 
in order to manage our members share of an individual restaurants business  we exclude certain members from receiving benefits at these restaurants in order to reduce the amount of a restaurant s cash flow that we receive 
the decline in average revenue per restaurant results in longer usage periods for our dining credits and contributed to the increase in our dining credits portfolio and the retention of restaurants in the marketing credits program 
the decline in average revenue per merchant was also due in part to a decline in our member activity 
we believe the decline in member activity was due in part to the termination of some partner programs and members not re registering replacement payment cards with us 
member payment cards expire or may be replaced on a periodic basis or as a result of credit card company security initiatives 
the replacement payment card must be registered with us in order for the member to continue to receive member benefits and for us to continue to recognize revenue when the member uses that payment card at a participating restaurant 
we believe that our larger base of participating restaurants and increased dining credits portfolio have positioned us well for we began the process of restructuring member benefits offered through our partners in the latter half of beginning in august  we devoted significant management time and information technology resources to negotiate with partners the terms of revised benefit offerings to become effective january  as a result of these efforts  with the exception of one partner  we modified the member tier criteria to reward both dining at participating restaurants and online engagement by providing the highest level of member benefits to members who have a specified number of dines at participating restaurants and those that provide us with their current email addresses and agree to receive our marketing promotions 
we also revised bonus opportunities to encourage members to complete surveys regarding their dining experience 
as a result of these efforts  we believe we will increase the number of email addresses that we have from members who agree to receive marketing promotions 
we intend to use these email addresses as a cost effective communication channel to promote our participating restaurants in a highly targeted manner to members that are interested in receiving information regarding participating restaurants  reward opportunities  restaurant content and bonus offers 
we invested in the development of new websites with rollout that began at the end of in order to more effectively engage both our members and our merchants  we invested in the development of new websites that we believe offer our members a valuable tool to be used in making dining decisions 
we designed these new websites to provide members with a comprehensive and credible source of dining information when selecting a restaurant and to highlight the rewards available to members for dining at participating restaurants 
these websites also offer our merchants enhanced capabilities for marketing their restaurants to members critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for dining credits losses  the valuation allowance  if any  for net deferred tax assets  investments and intangible assets 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for losses we provide allowances for dining credits losses and accounts receivables based on our estimate of losses that would result from the inability of participating merchants to remain in business or our merchant s unwillingness to honor their obligations relating to dining credits and accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of our merchant base were to deteriorate beyond our expectations  resulting in participating merchants inability to provide food  beverage  goods and services to members thereby reducing the redemption of dining credits  or if merchants are unwilling or otherwise unable to honor their obligations relating to dining credits or accounts receivable in greater numbers than we expect  additional allowances may be required 
we review our ability to redeem dining credits on a regular basis and provide for anticipated losses on dining credits 
the dining credits portfolio is aged based on sales for the preceding quarter and the allowance is determined primarily by applying estimated loss percentages to the aged portfolio 
allowances are also provided for specifically identified accounts and for dining credits balances that are large or slow moving 
losses are reduced by recoveries of dining credits previously charged off 
account balances are charged off against the allowance once we conclude that a merchant is unwilling or unable to honor their obligation relating to dining credits 
subsequent to the account being charged off  we may continue to pursue recovery efforts 
in the beginning of  we updated our write off policy to further define when an account should be written off 
as a result of this updated policy  there was a slower write off of assets in the gross dining credits asset and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during during  we expect to have higher write offs as a result of this policy update 
there was no change  however  in the reserve methodology 
we also provide an allowance for our rcr loan product using a specific reserve method based on the merchant s payment history and previous experience with the merchant  if applicable 
we purchase rcr loan notes from webbank after webbank originated and funded the rcr loan 
if an rcr loan merchant fails  we may not realize any value for the rcr loan note that we purchased 
even if an rcr loan merchant stays in business  it may fail to repay the note that we purchased and we may incur costs to collect on the note and may not recover amounts sufficient to compensate us for damages that we suffer 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is not likely to be recognized due to cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
we consider future taxable income and available tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
impairment loss on goodwill on at least an annual basis  we evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant the recognition of an impairment loss on goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our programs  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of projected cash flows  and  if different conditions prevail or judgments are made  a material write down of goodwill could occur 
we comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the current standard for periodic assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the impact of sfas no 
using a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the marketing credits program and marketing services program when members patronize participating merchants and pay using a payment card they have registered with us 
revenue is recognized only if the member s transaction qualifies for a benefit in accordance with the rules of the member s particular program 
the amount of revenue recognized is that portion of the member s total transaction amount that we are entitled to receive in cash  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the participating merchant 
for example  if a member s total qualified transaction amount is at a participating merchant  as evidenced by the full amount of the payment card transaction  and our contract provides for us to receive  the amount of revenue we recognize is  representing what we actually realize in cash 
similarly  under the typical marketing services program contract  we recognize revenue only to the extent that we are contractually entitled to receive cash for a portion of the member s total qualified transaction amount 
the same transaction referred to above at a marketing services program merchant may yield in revenue to be recognized 
under the rcr loan product  we recognize interest income on an effective yield basis over the life of the loan 
legal contingencies we review the status of significant legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure with respect to such legal matters on at least a quarterly basis 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations comparison of and as a means of better illustrating our operations and results  the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories for and these percentages have been rounded to the nearest tenth 
percentage of sales sales cost of sales provision for losses member benefits net revenue membership fees and other income total operating revenue salaries and benefits sales commission and expenses professional fees member and merchant marketing expenses general and administrative expenses litigation and related expenses total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income loss operating revenues the following table sets forth for the periods presented sales  components of costs of sales and certain other information for each of our two marketing programs 
we use the term dining credits to refer to the portion of future member transactions that we purchase 
our marketing credits program contracts include a fee for marketing  business intelligence  member feedback and frequency programs 
we include all components of the marketing credits program  including this fee  in marketing credits program sales and revenues because we analyze our business in this manner 
we use the term merchant in this discussion to refer to restaurants  bars and clubs 
financial information regarding our interest income from the rcr loan product is included in the marketing credits program sales strictly for purposes of our income statement 
marketing credits program marketing services program total marketing credits program marketing services program total merchant count as of december  and  respectively number of qualified transactions average transaction amount qualified transaction amount sales yield sales cost of dining credits processing fee total cost of sales provision for dining credits losses member benefits bonus rewards partner commissions total member benefits net revenue in analyzing sales  we focus on three key metrics merchant count  qualified transaction amount and sales yield 
merchant count is the number of merchants active in our program at the end of each period and average merchant count is the average number of merchants active on the program over a given period 
qualified transaction amount represents the total dollar value of all member dining transactions that qualify for a benefit  and therefore provide revenue to us 
sales yield represents the percentage of the qualified transaction amount that we retain as revenue 
with regard to merchant count  ending merchant count as of december  was  compared to  as of december   an increase of 
the increase in total merchant count was driven by a increase in marketing services program merchants to  merchants and a increase in marketing credits program merchants to  merchants 
average overall merchant count was  for compared to  for  a decrease of 
the decrease in the overall average merchant count was driven by a decrease in average marketing credits program merchants to  merchants  partially offset by a increase in average marketing services program merchants to  merchants 
the decrease in the average number of marketing credits program merchants for the full year as compared to the full year of was due in part to our revised dining credits purchasing policies  which has led to the removal of undesirable and unprofitable merchants from our dining credits portfolio 
the decrease was also due in part to merchants that we otherwise desired to retain in our program that either would not agree to terms of a new deal that reflected our revised dining credits purchasing policies or no longer desired to participate in our program 
finally  the revised purchasing policies resulted in a shorter usage period in the portfolio during  which accelerated the renewal cycle of the portfolio 
with an adequately staffed sales force through  our goal was to continue to grow the marketing credits program merchant count during that period without compromising the quality of the merchants in the portfolio or the profitability of deals by demonstrating the value of our services 
we made efforts to retain desirable merchants by increasing  on a risk adjusted basis  the amount of future member transactions that we purchased from them in order for them to remain in our program for a longer period of time 
our marketing credits program merchant count increased throughout as a result of this increase in merchant count and our purchase of more future member transactions from selected merchants  beginning in the first quarter of our net dining credits portfolio balance increased and our dining credits usage period lengthened 
we continually evaluate our dining credits purchase policies by monitoring the performance of our portfolio and observing current economic trends facing the restaurant industry 
during the later part of  we began shortening the dining credits usage period on new dining credits entering the portfolio 
we shorten the dining credits usage period by purchasing fewer dining credits  which reduces the size of our dining credits portfolio 
purchasing fewer dining credits reduces our risk exposure with respect to those deals  but also decreases the total revenue that we may realize from that deal and shortens the period of time the restaurant participates in our program if we are unable to renew the restaurant 
qualified transaction amounts at our participating merchants decreased  or  to  for compared to qualified transaction amount in the marketing credits program decreased primarily because of a decline in member activity  the management of our members share of individual restaurants business and a decline in the number of average marketing credits program merchants 
qualified transaction amount in our marketing services program increased at a slower rate than the marketing services program merchant count 
marketing services program merchant count increased as of december  as compared to december  while marketing services qualified transaction amount increased during as compared to marketing services qualified transaction amount increase was lower than the merchant count increase mainly due to a decrease in member activity and the management of our members share of individual restaurants business 
total sales yield decreased slightly to for compared with for the lower overall sales yield was a result of a shift in sales mix from the higher yield marketing credits program to the lower yield marketing services program 
sales yield for each of the marketing credits program and marketing services program increased 
the marketing credits program increased from for to for sales yield for the marketing services program increased from for to for sales for were lower as compared with primarily due to lower average marketing credits program merchant count  lower marketing credits program sales and lower qualified transaction amount  offset by an increase in marketing services program sales 
marketing credits program sales for were lower by  or  as compared with marketing services program sales for increased  or  when compared with the same period in the prior year 
cost of sales decreased to of total sales and of marketing credit program sales for as compared to of total sales and of marketing credit program sales for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease was due to a shift in revenues towards the marketing services program  which has no material cost of sales 
the provision for losses increased to of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for compared with of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for the provision was favorably impacted by policies that decreased the average amount of time it takes for members to use dining credits  a decrease in the dining credits portfolio balance  lower net write offs and higher profitability of deals 
during  the dining credits portfolio performed consistently with  but has also increased each quarter  resulting in a higher provision for losses expense than in the same period in the prior year  which we expected as we provided for current period losses and established incremental reserves for the growing portfolios at the time marketing credits program deals are entered into 
the provision for included reserves for both our dining credits portfolio and rcr loan notes we purchased during that period 
the provision for losses for rcr loan notes was  and the interest income  recorded within sales  was  for excluding the rcr loan notes provision for losses and interest income  the provision for losses was of marketing credits sales for as described above  we have decided to exit the rcr loan product effective january member benefits expense increased to of sales for compared with of sales for this increase as a percentage of sales between periods is primarily due to the shift in revenues from the marketing credits program to the marketing services program 
member benefits cost as a percentage of sales is higher for our marketing services program than they are for our marketing credits program 
in addition  increased partner promotions and member bonus opportunities during contributed to the increase 
also  sales attributable to our most engaged members  to whom we pay our highest level of benefits  have remained fairly constant while overall sales have declined  resulting in a higher overall benefit cost as a percentage of sales 
net revenues decreased to  or of sales during as compared to  or of sales during in addition to lower sales  net revenues were negatively impacted as compared to the prior period by a higher provision for losses associated with growth in the dining credits and rcr loan notes portfolios 
the higher provision for losses was partially offset by a lower cost of sales driven by improved profitability of the marketing credits program 
the above mentioned mix shift had a favorable impact on cost of sales and an unfavorable impact on member benefits expense  as the marketing services program carries no direct cost of sales but has a higher member benefits expense as a percent of sales 
membership and other income decreased or for compared with the decrease can be primarily attributed to the decline in fee paying members and the impact of an earn your dues dining program in which members earn their annual fees through the reduction of their cash back rewards savings 
operating expenses salaries and benefits decreased  or to  for from  for due primarily to a decrease in management bonus accruals of  a reduction in stock compensation expense of  and a reversal of stock compensation expense of as a result of our expected financial performance relative to plan in  partially offset by an increase in average headcount year over year 
sales commissions and expenses include sales force salaries and benefits  commissions  travel costs and training 
sales commissions and expenses increased to of sales for compared to of sales for due to an increase in salary expense and travel costs as we increased sales employee headcount 
professional fees decreased  or  to  for as compared to  for the decrease can be primarily attributed to lower sarbanes oxley and tax consulting costs 
member and merchant marketing expenses increased  or for compared with primarily due to an increase in new merchant and member acquisition programs  an increase in partner marketing programs as we focused on achieving portions of our minimum purchase obligations with certain partners for and an increase in outside agency costs due to the transition of certain marketing staff functions to an outside agency 
depreciation and amortization costs increased or for compared to as we continue to invest in the development of our websites  technology investments supporting the automation of internal processes  leasehold improvements for our office space and general information technology investments 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or for compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in severance costs and a decrease in management travel costs partially offset by an increase in telephone and internet expenses 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k  during  we reversed  in litigation and related expenses which consisted of  relating to the california class action lawsuit and relating to the source inc litigation 
during we recorded  of expense in litigation and related expenses which consisted of  relating to the california class action lawsuit and  relating to the source inc litigation 
the expenses related to the california class action suit consisted of the expense to the class  legal expenses incurred by us  legal expenses from the plaintiff s attorneys  claims administration costs and class representation costs 
the original reserve recorded in was based on our initial estimate of the cost of the settlement and related legal and administrative expenses 
the first installment for virtually all of the claims  payments to the representative plaintiffs and the first installment of payments to class counsel were made in december as such  the reserve was adjusted during as the actual amounts were determined 
other income and expense interest and other income decreased to  for compared with as a result of lower cash and cash equivalent balances year over year 
interest expense and financing costs increased to  primarily due to interest expense of recorded during as a result of the amortization of the discounted cash flows related to the california class action suit 
in addition  we recorded a gain of relating to the purchase of a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinate debentures as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was compared with for the decrease primarily resulted from changes in deferred tax assets caused by an increase in the state effective tax rate and an increase in tax exempt municipal interest  partially offset by an increase in state and local taxes net income net income was  for compared with a net loss of  for the increase in net income was primarily due to a reversal of litigation and related expenses relating to the california class action suit during and litigation and related expenses recorded during  offset by a decline in net revenues 
basic weighted average number of shares outstanding increased to  for compared to  for and diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased to  for compared to  for primarily due to the issuance of shares upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards during the first quarter of and the exercise of stock options 
results of operations comparison of and as a means of better illustrating our operations and results  the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories for and these percentages have been rounded to the nearest tenth

the decrease in total merchant count was driven by a  or  decrease in marketing credits program merchants to  merchants  offset by a  or  increase in marketing services program merchants to  merchants 
the decrease in the number of marketing credits program merchants was due in part to the steps we took to remove undesirable and unprofitable merchants from our dining credits portfolio 
the decrease was also due in part to merchants that we otherwise desired to retain in our program that either would not agree to terms of a new deal that reflected our revised dining credits purchasing policies or no longer desired to participate in our program 
we believe the increase in the number of marketing services program merchants was due to our improved value proposition to merchants  including timely business intelligence reports  customer rating data and marketing to members 
the marketing services program  while generating lower gross revenues  provides higher net revenues as a percentage of sales and does not require use of capital 
qualified transaction amount at our participating merchants decreased  or  to  for compared with the decrease in qualified transaction amount of was less than the decrease of in our merchant count during the same period 
the percent decline in qualified transaction amount was less than the percent decline in merchant count because of an increase in available benefit opportunities for members 
by increasing available benefit opportunities  we were able to award loyalty rewards to members for more of their transactions at participating merchants and increase the qualified transaction amount at participating merchants 
we believe that merchants accepted this increased availability in loyalty rewards because of our efforts to properly set their expectations regarding the amount of anticipated member activity when we enter into a deal with the merchant and because of the value of the marketing  business intelligence services and frequent dining programs that we provide 
total sales yield decreased to for compared with for the decrease in overall sales yield was a result of a shift in mix between higher yield marketing credits program and lower yield marketing services program merchant count as well as a decrease in sales yield for both programs 
sales yield for the marketing credits program decreased from for to for sales yield for the marketing services program decreased from for to for the decrease in marketing services program sales yield between periods was due to lower pricing introduced during and the first quarter of the lower pricing from and had a continued effect through because agreements for our marketing services program renew annually on the same terms 
pricing changes took time to impact sales yield as evidenced by the decline in marketing services sales yield during we introduced higher prices in january of and started to see improvements in sales yield during the fourth quarter of sales for decreased when compared with primarily due to a decrease in marketing credits program sales and a shift in sales mix towards marketing services program merchants 
marketing credits program sales for decreased  or  when compared with despite the decrease of in the total number of marketing credits program merchants during the same period 
the relatively smaller decline in sales as compared to the decline in merchant count was a result of a higher average qualified transaction amount and increased reward opportunities at these merchants 
marketing services program sales for increased  or  when compared with the same period in the prior year 
the impact on sales caused by the increase in merchant count for the marketing services program was partially offset by the decrease in sales yield between periods 
cost of sales  which is composed of the cost of dining credits and related processing fees  remained unchanged at of sales for and cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased during the first half of  but was offset by the lower cost of sales of dining credits purchased under our revised purchasing policies during the third and fourth quarters of the provision for dining credits losses decreased to of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for compared with of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for the provision for losses for was significantly lower than prior year because of lower gross write offs  improved cash recoveries of past write offs and a lower overall reserve requirement due to a decrease in the dining credits portfolio between periods 
in addition  the provision for losses for the three months ended september  included  related to merchants impacted by hurricane katrina 
our revised dining credits purchasing policies resulted in a decrease in the average amount of time it takes for members to use dining credits 
the estimated months to consume the dining credits portfolio decreased from approximately months in the fourth quarter of to approximately months in the fourth quarter of in addition  we continue to improve our due diligence and risk assessment procedures in order to reduce the potential risk that members will not be able to use all of the dining credits that we purchase from a merchant 
these two factors contributed to a decrease in the amount of dining credits that were written off as well as a lower reserve rate for the portfolio 
the ending allowance for dining credits losses as of december  was of the gross dining credits portfolio  as compared with as of december   which reflected lower risk in the dining credits portfolio due to our revised dining credits purchasing policies and improved due diligence and risk assessment procedures 
included in the allowance for dining credits losses for was recorded for the california litigation settlement  as discussed further in this section 
member benefits  which include partner commissions and incentive bonus awards paid to members  decreased slightly to of sales for compared with of sales for the same period in the prior year 
effective july   a variable loyalty rewards program was rolled out to substantially all of our loyalty partner program members in which some of our members loyalty rewards are tied to their level of participation in our programs 
the reduced loyalty rewards paid to less engaged members resulted in a lower overall effective rate of loyalty rewards earned by our total membership base during compared with this decrease was offset by two one time  special promotions held for members of certain partner programs during in which they received additional bonus miles for certain qualified transactions 
the improvement in the provision for losses and member benefits has resulted in an increase in net revenues for to  or of sales  from  or of sales  for membership and other income decreased or for compared with the decrease was primarily attributed to the decline in membership fee income and a focus on marketing a no fee dining program to key program partners in which we enrolled members at a reduced cost of solicitation and acquisition 
operating expenses salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for from  for due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r and an increase in management incentive compensation expense 
in  we achieved the financial performance targets and of potential management incentive compensation was earned 
in  we did not achieve the financial performance targets required for the full payment of management incentive compensation and as a result only of the potential management incentive compensation was paid 
the sfas no 
r expense included restricted stock unit expense of  during included in this amount was approximately  relating to vested restricted stock units of our chief executive officer  ronald l 
blake  which were granted upon mr 
blake joining the company 
sales commissions and expenses decreased to of sales for compared with of sales for due to a decline in salary expense 
sales commissions and expenses decreased in dollar terms by  as a result of lower headcount and associated headcount costs  such as travel  training and commissions 
in connection with our development of a value based selling approach  significant training costs were incurred in during  this training program was refined and is now run by internal resources  resulting in a decrease in training expense between periods

in we reinvested over  in our dining credits and rcr loan portfolios 
we expect that we will continue to grow our dining credits portfolio 
however  we are exiting the rcr loan program and will no longer invest in our rcr loan portfolio as we remain focused on our core product offerings  the marketing credits program and the marketing services program 
we intend to continue to put our cash to use in dining credits because we believe that investing in this portfolio is necessary to achieve long term  profitable growth

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale securities and anticipated cash flows are sufficient to meet our current cash requirements  subject to cash required to redeem the outstanding convertible debentures as discussed below 
convertible subordinated debentures on october   we completed a private placement of  principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures with a final maturity date of october  during  we purchased  of the convertible subordinate debentures for  utilizing a portion of our cash and cash equivalents reserves and recognized a gain on extinguishment of the outstanding balance of the convertible subordinate debentures as of december  was  holders of the debentures may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their debentures on october  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  together with accrued and unpaid interest  which we expect holders of the debentures to do 
we currently expect to fund the repurchase  if necessary  out of our cash reserves  the proceeds of additional debt or equity issuances  or a combination thereof 
we may need to raise cash to repurchase a portion of the debentures by reducing the amount of dining credits that we purchase 
if we were to reduce the amount of dining credits that we purchase  our marketing credits program revenues would be lower than if we did not reduce the amount of dining credits that we purchase  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have cash available or be able to raise cash  whether on favorable terms or otherwise  to satisfy the repurchase of the debentures 
our failure to repurchase the debentures because we do not have cash available or are unable to raise sufficient cash would cause us to be in default under the debentures and would have a material adverse effect on us 
the debentures bear interest at per annum  payable on april and october of each year 
there were no interest payments outstanding at december  the net proceeds from the offering were  and the issuance costs of  are being amortized over five years 
if we are not required to repurchase all of the debentures on october   holders of the debentures may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their debentures on october  and october  or upon a change of control 
we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  at any time after october  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
at the election of a holder  the debentures are convertible prior to the maturity date into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for certain events  upon the occurrence of any of the following i the closing price of our common stock on the trading day prior to the conversion date was or more of the conversion price of the debentures on such trading day  ii we have called the debentures for redemption  iii the average of the trading prices of the debentures for any five consecutive trading day period was less than the average conversion value for the debentures during that period  subject to certain limitations  or iv we make certain distributions to holders of our common stock or enter into specified corporate transactions 
if a holder elects to convert its debentures  the company may elect to pay cash to such holder in lieu of issuing shares of common stock 
contractual obligations and commitments we lease facilities and equipment under long term operating leases

on november   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and lasalle bank  na the lenders 
the credit facility expired on june  and we never had any borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
dining credits dining credits funded net dining credits less accounts payable dining credits was  as of december   an increase of  compared to december  accounts payable dining credits represent the unfunded portion of dining credits that we have an option to purchase from our merchants 
the increase in dining credits funded is due to the increased productivity of the sales force and an effort to leverage our risk analysis and management tools to deploy more capital to selected merchants and lengthen the usage periods where appropriate 
we believe the purchase of dining credits can generally be funded from cash generated from operations  subject to the cash required to redeem the outstanding convertible debentures
