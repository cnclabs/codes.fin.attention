other income expense provision for income taxes net earnings diluted earnings per share average diluted shares outstanding fiscal was the th consecutive year of both sales and earnings growth for clarcor 
fiscal years and were week years compared to fiscal which was a week year 
fiscal sales  operating profit and net earnings increased from fiscal by  and  respectively 
operating margins improved slightly to in after a slow start at the beginning of  demand strengthened  both domestically and internationally  for heavy duty engine filtration products used in both on road and off road applications 
strong demand continued throughout for air pollution control systems  for dust collection cartridges and for filter products used in off shore oil drilling  aviation  aviation fuel  aerospace  resin and fiber applications 
this had a positive impact on sales and operating profit while sales of environmental air filters and consumer and industrial packaging products declined 
despite the small increase in sales  the company was able to implement cost reduction initiatives and increase prices to offset most cost increases for raw materials  freight and energy  leading to a slight improvement in operating margins 
overall  with the exception of the company s environmental air 
table of contents manufacturing operations  the filter operations performed well and continued the strong performance they have achieved over many years with continued growth in sales and solid operating margins 
on march   the company acquired an ownership share in sinfa sa sinfa  a manufacturer of automotive and heavy duty engine filters based in casablanca  morocco  for approximately million plus debt of approximately million 
sinfa was included in the engine mobile filtration segment from the date of acquisition 
during february  the company acquired the synthetic fibers filtration business from the newton tool mfg 
company  inc newton tool for approximately million 
this business and its operating equipment were moved into existing facilities within the industrial environmental filtration segment 
neither acquisition had a material effect on the results of subsequent to year end  on december   the company acquired perry equipment corporation peco  a privately owned manufacturer of engineered filtration products and technologies used in a wide array of industries  including oil and natural gas  refining  power generation  petrochemical  food and beverage  electronics  polymers and pulp and paper 
peco is based in mineral wells  texas with operations in mexico  canada  united kingdom  italy  romania  malaysia and china 
peco will be merged with the company s facet operations with its headquarters based in mineral wells 
peco was acquired to expand the company s product offerings  technology  filtration solutions and customer base in the growing oil and natural gas industries 
its results will be included in the company s industrial environmental filtration segment 
the purchase price was approximately million and is subject to a post closing adjustment based on a formula in the purchase agreement 
the company issued  shares of clarcor common stock with a value of approximately million and paid the remaining purchase price with available cash and approximately million of cash borrowed under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the transaction is expected to be approximately to accretive to the company s fiscal earnings with significantly greater accretion expected in future years as the benefits from the merger of peco and facet are realized 
see further discussion in note s to the consolidated financial statements 
clarcor s financial position remains strong 
cash and short term investments at year end were approximately million compared to million at the end of even after repurchasing million of the company s common stock and spending million for business acquisitions 
cash flow from operating activities totaled million  of which million was invested in plant asset additions and million was used to pay dividends to shareholders 
the following are other significant items that occurred during the periods presented in fiscal  the company recognized one time tax benefits of million  or per diluted share  of which million was recorded in the third quarter of and was related to the completion of various income tax audits and the finalization of certain income tax liabilities 
the other million was recorded in the first quarter of and related to the passage of the research and experimentation tax credit extension 
the company began a three year restructuring program in for its heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac filter operations primarily to rationalize and relocate certain hvac filter manufacturing plants to improve operating efficiencies and reduce manufacturing and transportation costs 
the plan includes capital spending of approximately million 
the company expected to realize significant cost savings beginning in and continuing over the next several years 
however  due to equipment delays  the anticipated savings and efficiencies were not realized in but are expected in see a further discussion of this program in the operating profit section of this analysis 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to operating profit related to a customer s refusal to pay for products it had ordered and used 
in addition  the company terminated a million annual sales contract with this customer 
the company settled the resulting lawsuit during the specific terms of the settlement are confidential 
clarcor recognized stock option expense of million pre tax or approximately per diluted share  in compared to million pre tax  or approximately per diluted share  in no stock option expense was recorded in prior years 

table of contents in fiscal  a one time tax benefit of approximately million  or per diluted share  reduced income tax expense 
this benefit resulted from the favorable settlement of a tax position related to a foreign subsidiary 
operating results sales net sales in fiscal were million  a increase from million in fiscal the sales increase was the st consecutive year of sales growth for the company 
acquisitions during and contributed an incremental million to sales in fluctuations in foreign currencies contributed to sales in by approximately one and one half percent  or million 
in  fluctuations in foreign currencies affected sales by less than one percent

change net sales dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total vs 
change net sales dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total the engine mobile filtration segment s sales increased in from and in from approximately million of the increase was due to the sinfa acquisition 
heavy duty engine filter sales through independent distributors  in both domestic and international aftermarkets  oem dealers  truck fleets and national accounts grew even though domestic trucking companies reported a softening in hauled tonnage in north america during filter markets for off road applications for construction  mining and agricultural equipment were also strong in both years 
railroad filter sales declined slightly in from levels but the decline was less than the drop in railroad traffic and car loadings in the united states 
international engine mobile filtration operations  led by sales increases of over in china  australia and europe  recorded higher sales in than double digit sales growth in china is expected to continue into new product introductions and the breadth of the segment s filter product line contributed to sales growth in both years 
approximately million of the sales increase was due to the weakening of the us dollar during compared to there was no material impact from currency fluctuations in price increases averaged to in there were no significant price increases in the company s industrial environmental filtration segment reported a million or decrease in sales compared to  however  there were significant differences between industrial and environmental air filtration markets 
most of the segment s sales decrease was due to lower sales volume at the company s environmental air filter manufacturing operations 
sales at the company s hvac filter manufacturing operations were lower in than in this was caused by a number of factors including the elimination of certain low margin customers and delays in deliveries to customers due to transitional issues at the company s hvac 
table of contents plants 
as part of the hvac filter restructuring program  the company is regionalizing its manufacturing facilities to serve designated areas of the united states with a more complete product line at each facility 
this requires moving equipment between facilities and adding new manufacturing plants  such as the new plant in pittston  pennsylvania which began production late in the second quarter of as a result of this activity  the hvac filter plants were sometimes unable to ship some customer orders and sales suffered during the company believes it has resolved these delivery problems resulting in improved service levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects hvac filter sales for fiscal year to be relatively unchanged from the level due to continued restructuring activities and the elimination of certain low margin customers 
excluding the results of the hvac filter manufacturing operations  the company s other industrial environmental filtration operations improved sales by approximately in compared to sales growth occurred  both domestically and internationally  in most product lines including process liquid filters  systems and filter cartridges for the aviation fuel and defense sectors  filters for aerospace applications  specialty filtration  pollution control systems  sand control filters used in off shore oil and gas drilling  filters for plastic and polymer fiber and resin applications and sales to the company s total filtration program customers 
sales of environmental filtration equipment were also stronger in than in in  the company introduced dust collector cartridges containing nanofiber media  which helped grow sales for this product line in compared to a first quarter acquisition contributed approximately million of sales to the weakening of the us dollar during compared to contributed approximately million to sales for changes in currency translation rates did not significantly impact sales growth in in addition to the lower hvac filter sales volumes in discussed above  this segment was impacted by the loss of a million annual sales contract with a customer who had refused to pay amounts owed to the company 
the company terminated this contract during the second quarter of approximately million of sales were reported in related to this contract 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled its litigation against this customer 
based on current order demand and sales backlog  the company expects continued solid demand for process liquid filters  filters used by resin and fiber manufacturers  systems and filter cartridges for the aviation fuel and defense sectors  filters for aerospace applications  sand control filters used in off shore oil and gas drilling and environmental filtration equipment for the company also expects sales growth in its total filtration program as this program continues to gain momentum as new customers are added 
six fortune companies were added to the company s total filtration program in the last twelve months along with other smaller companies 
acquisitions made in contributed approximately million of sales in sales in grew strongly in several specialty filtration markets  both in domestic and in international markets  including aviation fuel filtration systems  aerospace filters  dust collector cartridges  plastic and polymer applications and rainwater runoff systems 
sales of filters sold into the oil and gas market were lower in both and as customer demand was weaker than expected 
however  clarcor saw a rebound in orders for sand control filters used in off shore oil drilling during the fourth quarter of which continued throughout the company expects this demand will continue throughout due to expected increases in drilling and exploration as a result of anticipated continuing demand and high prices for oil and gas 
the segment s operations in europe that sell primarily aviation and specialty filtration products  such as waste water filtration and rainwater runoff filtration systems  grew in and and additional growth is expected in sales levels in were lower for environmental filtration equipment and hvac filters used in industrial  commercial and residential applications 
lower hvac filter sales were due in part to lower filter usage in automotive and automotive parts manufacturing plants and in commercial and industrial applications and also due to competitive pricing pressures 
the segment continues to implement price increases to offset material cost and freight increases 
the packaging segment s sales of million declined from primarily as a result of delays and cancellations of customers new product introductions 
in addition  sales were impacted by lower demand for flat sheet metal decorating and confectionery and personal care packaging 
the company does not believe it has lost business to competitors in this segment 
the segment s sales were unusually strong at million  an increase from  due to the introduction of a wide array of new packaging designs  primarily in partnership with 
table of contents major consumer product companies  and price increases 
customer demand for fabricated metal packages  combination metal plastic packages and plastic packaging was stronger in operating profit operating profit for increased to million from the level of million  primarily due to higher engine mobile filtration segment sales  increased specialty and process liquid filtration sales and company wide cost reduction efforts that offset losses in the environmental air filter operations 
operating margin increased slightly to compared to in and in although costs for freight and purchased materials  including metal products  filter media and petroleum based products  have increased significantly over the past two years  price increases to customers have been implemented to help offset the cost increases 
the increase in operating profit for to million reflected higher engine mobile filtration segment sales  various acquisitions which contributed million of incremental operating profit  a gain on an insurance recovery  elimination of a reserve related to an overseas subsidiary  cost reductions and improved capacity utilization 
these positive items were offset by stock option expense of million  charges of million arising from the refusal by a customer to pay for products which it had ordered and used  and approximately million in costs associated with the restructuring of a european aviation cartridge filter manufacturing facility and the closing of an hvac filter manufacturing facility in north carolina 
the cost savings during related to restructurings were not significant although the company did realize anticipated savings in fiscal related to the european manufacturing restructuring 
the hvac filter restructuring plan is discussed more thoroughly below and in the outlook section 
a weakened us dollar in contributed approximately million to operating profit 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on consolidated operating profit in or comparative operating profit information related to the company s business segments is as follows 
vs 
change operating profit dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total vs 
change operating profit dollars in millions total engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total operating margin as a percent of net sales engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging total the engine mobile filtration segment reported operating profit of million  a increase over profit of million 
this increase resulted primarily from sales volume growth and continued cost reduction efforts 
the segment s operating margin of remains strong although it decreased slightly from for due to somewhat slower domestic sales growth overall  higher international sales growth where margins are 
table of contents somewhat lower than in the united states and a litigation settlement in for fiscal  the company expects overall operating margin for this segment to remain relatively consistent 
operating margin improved in as a result of increased sales and capacity utilization  discretionary spending controls and significant improvement in the operations of a manufacturing facility in the uk the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to this segment s operating profit for and was not material 
the industrial environmental filtration segment s operating profit of million and operating margin of in was unchanged from that of  however  there was margin improvement during the final quarter of the segment s operating results were impacted by lower sales volumes  continued costs to restructure and integrate manufacturing facilities in its hvac filter manufacturing operations  including the start up costs at its new production facility in pennsylvania  and costs related to the relocation of acquired inventory and machinery from the acquisition of the synthetic fiber filtration business of newton tool in february as the company reorganizes its hvac filter manufacturing and distribution facilities  integrates plant purchasing  consolidates customer service  moves manufacturing lines and trains new employees  it has incurred higher costs than anticipated 
the company s hvac filter manufacturing operation did increase prices to offset rising material and freight costs during the company is continuing to implement its three year plan to restructure its hvac filter manufacturing operations 
the company had expected delivery of a significant amount of new equipment earlier in fiscal  however  in some cases  delivery had been delayed until late fiscal and fiscal as a result  planned reductions in labor costs and improvement in manufacturing productivity are now expected to be realized in fiscal rather than in the hvac filter manufacturing restructuring program cost approximately million in fiscal nevertheless  the company expects an operating profit improvement of million by the end of compared to and operating margins in the industrial environmental filtration segment to eventually reach 
the company expects to report improvement in the operating profit at its hvac filter manufacturing operations of approximately million in fiscal compared to excluding the results of the hvac filter operations  operating profit for the industrial environmental filtration segment improved over and margins improved from to due to higher sales in most product lines including aviation fuel  aerospace  oil and gas  plastic and fiber resins  pollution control system and specialty product lines 
better utilization of the segment s production facilities at non hvac filter manufacturing operations and a monetary settlement from a lawsuit also contributed to higher margins 
in addition  included the million charge related to a customer s refusal to pay and the european restructuring charges of million 
foreign currency translation contributed approximately million to the operating profit for this segment when compared to the industrial environmental filtration segment s operating profit of million decreased from million in due to reduced sales of hvac filters  environmental filtration equipment and oil and gas filter products 
the productivity from these facilities was less in due to lower than expected sales and production levels 
operating profit was also impacted by problems with installing a new computer system and maintaining proper levels of inventory at its hvac operations  bad debt expense and the restructuring charges noted previously 
the segment s operating margin decreased to in from in the packaging segment s operating profit of million in was lower than the million reported in the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes and unused capacity during fiscal compared to although operating margin decreased to in from in  the segment management responded quickly to lower sales volumes with cost controls that averted potentially lower margins 
the strong sales volume in  along with an ongoing focus on improving manufacturing efficiency through closely monitoring productivity measures and implementing cost reduction initiatives  contributed to higher operating profits and margins for fiscal 
table of contents other income expense net other income totaled million in compared to million in and to net other expense of million in the most significant change relates to million of expense in related to the acquisition of the minority interest in a south african subsidiary 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for was compared to in and in the unusually low effective tax rate was due to a tax benefit of approximately million related to the completion of various income tax audits and the finalization of certain income tax liabilities in the third quarter and a cumulative tax benefit of million during the first quarter from the research and experimentation tax credit extension that congress passed in december these one time benefits reduced the effective rate in by approximately 
faster profit growth in international operations with lower tax rates than in the united states and a decline in the extraterritorial income exclusion deduction also contributed to a lower tax rate for compared to that of and the effective tax rate for was higher due to changes in the deductibility of certain expenses 
the effective tax rate in is expected to be approximately to and reflects a benefit from expected future growth in lower tax localities and an increase in the benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction 
the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective tax rate of 
a tax benefit of approximately million in the third quarter of resulted from the favorable settlement of a tax position related to a foreign subsidiary  which reduced the effective rate in by approximately one percentage point 
net earnings and earnings per share net earnings were million in  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million in  or per share on a diluted basis 
earnings per share was reduced by approximately per diluted share in and per diluted share in related to the implementation of stock option expense accounting 
net earnings were million in  or diluted earnings per share of 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  diluted earnings per share would have been for had compensation expense for stock options been recorded in accordance with statement of financial accountings standards sfas no 
in  the impact of stock option expense is expected to be approximately per diluted share 
the decrease in diluted average shares outstanding for fiscal compared to was due to the repurchase of  shares in offset by grants of  shares of stock based incentives 
the company repurchased  shares in and  shares in under the company s share repurchase authorization 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources clarcor s financial position remains strong 
cash and short term investments at year end were million compared to million at year end even after repurchasing million of its common stock during the current ratio of at year end was relatively unchanged from at year end long term debt of million at year end related primarily to industrial revenue bonds 
the slight increase in long term debt from year end relates to debt incurred as part of the sinfa acquisition 
subsequent to year end  the company incurred approximately million in debt under its line of credit to fund a portion of the purchase price for the peco acquisition 
shareholders equity increased to million from million at year end primarily as a result of net earnings and stock option activity offset by stock repurchases of million and dividend payments of million 
total debt was of total capitalization at year end compared to at year end cash generated from operating activities increased million to million for primarily due to higher net earnings and reduced investment in working capital 
the working capital fluctuations were due to business level activities and mainly resulted from the timing of payments made to vendors  the receipt of payments 
table of contents from customers  changes in inventory requirements and the timing of income tax payments 
the working capital change included million of cash provided by the sale of short term investments  whereas in  over million of cash was used to purchase short term investments 
in addition  due to the adoption of new accounting rules for stock based compensation effective at the beginning of  cash flow provided by operating activities was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  due to tax benefits associated with tax deductions that exceeded the amount of compensation expense recognized in net earnings 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and million in the million decrease in from was primarily due to the net increase in purchases of short term investments of million  inventories of million and income taxes of million 
the increase in inventory was a normal seasonal increase 
for  cash flows used in investing activities of million were higher than the million recorded in primarily due to increased spending on plant asset additions and business acquisitions 
the company spent million on two business acquisitions in compared to million in and million in additions to plant assets of million were primarily for the hvac filter manufacturing restructuring program  new product development programs  facility additions and improvements and cost reduction programs 
capital expenditures for normal facility maintenance and improvements  expansion of manufacturing  warehouse and technical facilities  productivity improvements  the hvac restructuring program  new products and filter media development are expected to be to million in capital spending included in this amount and related to the restructuring program is estimated to be approximately million in plant asset additions totaled million in and million in although a substantial amount of new equipment had been ordered in  it was not delivered as quickly as expected 
therefore  capital spending was lower than anticipated 
net cash used for financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in the company spent million of cash to repurchase  shares of its common stock in compared to spending million to repurchase shares in the company paid dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the quarterly dividend rate was increased in september by to per share 
on june   the company s board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program of the company s common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a three year period 
this authorization replaced the company s previous million share repurchase authorization that expired on june  during  the company purchased and retired  shares of common stock for million 
in and  respectively  the company acquired  shares of common stock for million and  shares of common stock for million 
the number of issued shares was reduced as a result of the retirement of these shares 
at november   there was approximately million available for repurchase under the current authorization 
future repurchases of company stock may be made after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  interest rates and the current stock price 
at year end  clarcor had  shares of common stock outstanding compared to  shares outstanding at the end of subsequent to year end  the company issued  shares of its common stock in partial consideration of the purchase of peco as discussed in note s to the consolidated financial statements 
clarcor believes that its current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient lines of credit remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  complete the hvac filter restructuring plans  service and repay debt  repurchase company stock and fund acquisitions 
subsequent to year end on december   the company entered into a five year multicurrency revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions under which it may borrow up to million under a selection of currencies and rate formulas 
this replaced the million credit agreement that would have expired in april as of year end  there were no outstanding borrowings against the million facility 
under a related million letter of credit subline  million had been issued for letters of credit for industrial revenue bonds as of year end the company s long term debt totaled million at year end and consists principally of industrial revenue bonds 
required principal payments on long term debt will be approximately million in based on scheduled payments in current debt agreements 
as mentioned previously related to the peco acquisition  the company borrowed approximately million on its credit agreement subsequent to year end which is scheduled to 
table of contents be repaid within the five year term of the agreement 
the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement after year end as described under off balance sheet arrangements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants related to its borrowings  as described in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of the hvac filter manufacturing restructuring strategy which began in  clarcor plans to invest approximately million  primarily in new facilities and state of the art production equipment  and to spend million to restructure current facilities over three years 
this is anticipated to result in an improvement in operating profit of million annually by the end of three years 
the goal is to have the company s hvac filter manufacturing operations become the lowest delivered cost and most productive hvac filtration operation in the industry and for segment operating margins to reach 
specifically for  the company anticipates incurring approximately million in expenses and realizing approximately million in cost reductions mainly in the third and fourth quarters 
therefore  the net benefit for from the restructuring program is estimated to be million 
the company believes the future annual benefit will be much larger as the restructuring costs are a one time item whereas the cost reductions are expected to recur every year going forward 
the company has no material long term purchase commitments 
it is committed to restructure its hvac operations as discussed in the previous paragraphs 
although no significant purchase commitments were signed as of year end  approximately million of equipment related to the restructuring was on order 
the company enters into purchase obligations with suppliers on a short term basis in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes the company s current fixed cash obligations as of november  for the fiscal years indicated payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in millions long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases total interest payments on the company s variable rate debt are determined based on current interest rates as of year end the table above does not include payments related to debt incurred subsequent to the end of the million borrowed after year end will be due under the company s five year revolving credit agreement by the end of the five year term 
annual interest payments related to the million will be approximately million for the next two years based on the swap agreement entered into after year end 
after that  interest will be paid at a variable rate based on the terms of the agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had no significant derivative  swap  hedge  variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements at fiscal year end or or any time during those years 
as discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements  subsequent to year end  the company entered into an interest rate agreement with an international bank to manage its interest rate exposure on certain amounts outstanding under its million revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate agreement provides for the company to pay a fixed interest rate and receive a three month libor on a notional amount of million and expires january  
table of contents other matters quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
however  based on the low level of debt obligations as of year end  interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to the company in fiscal  and as a result  it is anticipated that a change in rates would not have a material impact on the company s net earnings or cash flows in fiscal the company s debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
in order to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements 
the additional million borrowed subsequent to year end would not materially impact the interest rate risk for the next two years since the company entered into a fixed interest rate swap agreement related to this debt 
additionally  any debt assumed with the acquisition of peco would not materially impact interest rate risk since amounts outstanding on peco s line of credit prior to the acquisition were immediately paid by the company and the other peco debt outstanding is not material 
although the company continues to evaluate derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options  to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  the company did not hold derivatives during  or the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates was not material to the company s financial condition and results of operations in fiscal the impact of future changes in foreign currency translation rates is difficult to estimate  however  the company estimates that if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where the company s foreign income and cash flows are derived the effect on the consolidated results of operations could be to per diluted share 
as a result of continued foreign sales and business activities  the company will continue to evaluate the use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future 
critical accounting estimates the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require the company s management to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company periodically reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
the company analyzed various discount rates  transaction multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared which indicated that if these assumptions were individually changed by  there was no indication of impairment 
allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which the company sells and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances 
table of contents totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for the qualified plan for us employees was determined based on the citigroup pension discount curve for cash flows at the plan s estimated liability duration of years 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense in fiscal of approximately million  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately million for the company s qualified defined benefit pension plan for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected asset returns and this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved

the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its financial statements 
outlook the company expects sales growth  margin improvement and higher diluted earnings per share in fiscal  which would result in the th consecutive year of both sales and earnings per share growth 
diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of to in  which includes the impact of the acquisition of peco and estimated stock based compensation expense of approximately for compared to per diluted share for fiscal in future years  the company will continue to emphasize cost reductions and price increases to customers within each business unit in an effort to offset anticipated increased costs for energy and purchased materials  primarily metal and petroleum based products  freight  energy and employee benefits 
these costs for the company may change significantly based on future changes in the us and world economies 
the company believes consolidated sales and profits will improve as a result of sales initiatives  manufacturing productivity programs and cost reductions 
if unfavorable economic conditions occur  the company expects to implement cost reduction programs in response  which could adversely affect the company s outlook
