item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water by artesian water  which comprises of total operating revenues  the amount of which is subject to seasonal fluctuations  particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature 
in the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected  or rainfall is greater than expected  the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected 
we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
our water sales revenues were affected in by rate increases approved by the delaware public service commission 
as permitted under delaware law  a interim increase in rates was placed in effect july  pending conclusion of our filing with the psc for rate relief 
on december  the psc approved a settlement agreement in this case 
the increase in annual revenue requirement under the settlement agreement of million was to be implemented in two steps 
as a result of the psc approval of the settlement agreement  water rates were further adjusted effective january  to reflect a total approved increase of with an additional second step increase in rates that became effective july  upon completion of our issuance of common stock 
the first step  placed in effect january   was to generate approximately million in annual revenue 
following the common stock issuance  artesian resources contributed additional paid in capital to artesian water 
subsequently  the second step rates  designed to recover approximately million of annual revenue  which reflected approximately million of additional equity  were placed in effect july  artesian water pennsylvania  our wholly owned pennsylvania water utility subsidiary  began operations in  providing water service to a residential community in chester county  consisting of customers 
in  the pennsylvania public utilities commission approved our application to increase our service area to encompass four specific developments that are expected to add customers 
development in these specific developments has not progressed pending resolution of developer related township approvals 
on july   the maryland public service commission approved the acquisition of carpenters point water company 
the acquisition was completed on august  in a transaction accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and the results of operations have been included in the consolidated statement of income as of the august  acquisition date 
carpenters point water company has been renamed artesian water maryland 
artesian water maryland serves a home community near the interstate growth corridor between philadelphia and baltimore in cecil county  maryland  and has sufficient groundwater supply to serve additional customers in the undeveloped portions of its franchise and surrounding area 
cecil county has designated the interstate corridor as a preferred growth area for business and residential expansion 
recently  the federal base re alignment and closure commission announced the relocation of approximately  jobs to nearby aberdeen  maryland by the wilmington metropolitan area planning commission projects cecil county will grow percent between and and the maryland department of planning projects that cecil county will experience the highest rate of household growth through of any jurisdiction in the state 
we have entered into an agreement to purchase the mountain hill water company  which currently serves two commercial accounts in the principio business park and which is located within cecil county s designated growth corridor 
we have also been selected by cecil county as the water and wastewater utility to serve a designated service territory within the growth corridor and we are in negotiations with cecil county regarding terms of the water and wastewater franchise agreements for the area 
our regulated wastewater subsidiary  artesian wastewater  owns wastewater infrastructure and began providing wastewater services in delaware in july our wastewater customers are billed a flat monthly fee  which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather 
as of december  artesian wastewater had customers in six communities 

table of contents our two other subsidiaries  neither of which is regulated  are artesian utility development  inc  or artesian utility  which designs and builds water and wastewater infrastructure and provides contract water and wastewater services on the delmarva peninsula  and artesian development corporation  or artesian development  owns an approximately six acre parcel of land zoned for office buildings located immediately adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
on october   artesian development purchased approximately twenty acres of land located on route  west of the city of lewes in sussex county  delaware 
artesian development received a conditional use for this land from sussex county to construct an office facility to serve southern delaware 
this conditional use also includes allowing for the construction of water treatment and wastewater facilities and elevated water storage on the site to provide service to the area between lewes and georgetown  delaware 
once permits and approvals to construct the facilities are received  appropriate agreements with the utility affiliates of artesian development for its use will be developed 
on may   artesian utility acquired all rights  titles and interest in the operations contracts of tmh environmental services  inc or tmh 
tmh  incorporated in pennsylvania  provided contract water and wastewater operation services to private  municipal and governmental institutions in the southeastern part of pennsylvania 
in addition to services discussed above  artesian resources initiated a service line protection plan  or slp plan  in march the slp plan covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking water service lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our  eligible water customers had signed up for the slp plan 
while water sales revenues are our primary source of revenues  we continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water operations and wastewater management services 
our contract operations and wastewater management services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns 
we plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and wastewater services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers 
our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction  which may be affected by interest rates  inflation and general housing and economic market conditions 
we will continue to focus attention on expanding our contract operations opportunities with municipalities and private water providers in delaware and surrounding areas 
ensuring our customers have a dependable supply of safe  high quality water has been  and will continue to be  our highest priority 
in  delaware passed legislation requiring all water utilities to certify by july that they had sufficient sources of self supply to serve their respective systems 
on march   we filed our certification of self sufficiency of supply with the psc 
the review was completed on june   and the psc concluded that we demonstrated that we had sufficient water supply to meet the demands of our customers through in addition and as required by law  on june   we filed with the psc a new certification of self sufficiency for the period through after completion of their review  on july   the psc accepted our certification of sufficient water supply through also on june   artesian water provided the city of wilmington  delaware city with notice of non renewal of the interconnection agreement with the city upon its december  termination 
artesian water is no longer required to purchase million gallons annually from the city after december  at rates  that obligation was approximately  
table of contents water industry the federal environmental protection agency s may report states that the united states water industry is comprised of approximately  community water systems  of which serve less than  customers 
only of all community water systems are run by investor owned utilities 
there are currently publicly traded water utilities based in the united states 
the rest are privately or municipally owned systems 
the water industry is capital intensive  with the highest capital investment in plant and equipment per dollar of revenue among all utilities 
increasingly stringent drinking water regulations to meet the requirements of the safe drinking water act of have required the water industry to invest in more advanced treatment systems and processes  which require a heightened level of expertise 
we are currently in full compliance with the requirements of the safe drinking water act 
even though our water utility was founded in  the majority of our investment in infrastructure occurred in the last years 
we believe that delaware s generally lower cost of living in the region  availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the atlantic ocean in sussex county  and attractive financing rates for construction and mortgages have resulted  and will continue to result  in increases to our customer base 
substantial portions of delaware are currently not served by a public water system  which could also assist in an increase to our customer base as systems are added 
according to the us census bureau  delaware s population increased an estimated from to  as compared to the nationwide growth rate of approximately 
interest rates for mortgages have fallen from on average in december to through december long term interest rates for our recent first mortgage bond issuance see 
note to our financial statements reflect a similar trend  as we were able to reduce our overall weighted cost of debt from in to at the end of strategic direction we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
as we anticipated  our initiatives south of the chesapeake delaware canal  or the c d canal  that began in are now providing the greatest portion of our customer growth 
this shift in growth is primarily the result of the build out of our service area in northern new castle county 
in  we increased our customer base by and increased our service territory by approximately square miles  a increase 
we believe the recent slow down in the housing market does not materially affect our strategic goals and objectives 
we continued to increase our sources of supply  adding about million gallons to our daily production capacity  to assure we have adequate high quality water supply to meet our customer growth expectations 
our strategy is to focus on total resource management covering a wide spectrum of activities  which include identifying new and dependable sources of supply  developing the wells  treatment plants and delivery systems to get water to the customers  educating customers on the wise use of water  and providing responsible wastewater management to assist with recharge of the aquifers 
our strategy includes focusing our efforts to expand in new regions added to our service territory over the last years  where growth is strong and demand is increasing 
these regions have provided approximately of our growth in customers in and we expect continued growth in these regions 
we also foresee significant growth opportunities in our wastewater subsidiaries and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and municipalities to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service in delaware and surrounding areas 
in addition  we believe growth for artesian resources will be developed in the maryland counties on the delmarva peninsula 
these opportunities include the efforts of artesian water maryland  which is currently serving customers and is expected to provide sufficient groundwater supply and elevated water storage to serve additional customers 
we have also entered into an agreement to purchase the mountain hill water company  which currently serves two commercial accounts in the principio business park and which is located within cecil county  maryland designated growth corridor 
also  the purchase of all the wastewater and water operations agreements of tmh in pennsylvania expanded our water and wastewater activity in the region and added experienced  qualified and licensed water and wastewater operators to our staff 
it is our opinion that this expansion will provide artesian resources with additional potential for continued growth 

table of contents regulatory matters and inflation as of december   we had approximately  metered water customers  wastewater customers  and served a population of approximately  including contract services  representing approximately of delaware s total population 
increases in the number of customers served by artesian water and artesian wastewater contributed to increases in our operating revenues 
the delaware psc regulates both artesian water s and artesian wastewater s rates charged for service  the sale and issuance of securities and other matters 
the additional customers served by artesian water maryland also contribute to increases in our operating revenues 
the maryland public service commission  or the mdpsc  regulates rates charged for service  the sale and issuance of securities and other matters in maryland 
our regulated utilities periodically seek rate increases to cover the cost of increased operating expenses  increased financing expenses due to additional investments in utility plant and other costs of doing business 
in delaware  utilities are permitted by law to place rates into effect  under bond  on a temporary basis pending completion of a rate increase proceeding 
the first temporary increase may be up to the lesser of million on an annual basis or of gross water sales 
should the rate case not be completed within seven months  by law  the utility may put the entire requested rate relief  up to of gross water sales  in effect under bond until a final resolution is ordered and placed into effect 
if any such rates are found to be in excess of rates the psc finds to be appropriate  the utility must refund the portion found to be in excess to customers with interest 
the timing of our rate increase requests are therefore dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase 
we can provide no assurances that rate increase requests will be approved by applicable regulatory agencies  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
artesian water s last increase in water rates was approved by the psc and placed into effect on july  on january   artesian water submitted a notice to the psc of our intent to file an application for a rate increase  as is required to be submitted not less than days prior to filing an application 
delaware statute permits water utilities to put into effect  on a semi annual basis  increases related to specific types of distribution system improvements through a distribution system improvement charge or dsic 
this charge is available to water utilities to be implemented between general rate increase applications that normally recognize changes in a water utility s overall financial position 
the dsic approval process is less costly when compared to the approval process for general rate increase requests 
the dsic rate applied between base rate filings is capped at of the amount billed to customers under otherwise applicable rates and charges  and the dsic rate increase applied can not exceed within any month period 
during we earned approximately  in revenue 
we did not have dsic in effect during in december  artesian water filed an application with the psc for approval to collect  effective january   to recover the costs of eligible non revenue producing improvements made since the last rate case in the psc approved the dsic effective january  subject to audit at a later date 
in  the general assembly passed legislation restructuring the electric industry in delaware 
since the passage of electric restructuring legislation in  electricity prices had been capped for customers of delmarva power and the delaware electric cooperative 
those rate caps were lifted in for customers of the delaware electric cooperative and in may for delmarva power customers 
our electric charges increased in due to higher billing rates charged by delaware electric cooperative after the cap was removed 
in  our electric charges increased further due to the increase from delmarva power 
artesian resources sought to mitigate future increases by signing a two year fixed price supply contract with pepco energy services in may this contract is due to expire in may to continue to mitigate future increases we are currently examining new bids for service for the next two years 
on april   the psc made effective new rules under regulation docket that govern the terms and conditions under which water utilities require advances or contributions from customers or developers 
these regulations require that developers pay for all water facilities within a new development  with such funding recorded as contributions in aid of construction by the water utility 
in addition  the utility is required to receive a contribution in aid of construction of  for each new residential connection to its system towards the cost of water supply  treatment and storage facilities 
these regulations further require developers to fully pay for facilities to serve satellite systems 
these required contributions are intended to place a greater burden upon new customers to pay for the cost of facilities required to serve them 

table of contents we are affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand our service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility costs compared to investments made to years ago  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
critical accounting policies all additions to plant are recorded at cost 
cost includes direct labor  materials  and indirect charges for such items as transportation  supervision  pension  medical  and other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction activities 
when depreciable units of utility plant are retired  the cost of retired property  together with any cost associated with retirement and less any salvage value or proceeds received  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs  and replacement of minor items of plant are charged to expense as incurred 
we record water service revenue  including amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts  based upon estimated usage from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
these estimates are made on an individual customer basis  based on one of three methods the previous year s consumption in the same period  the previous billing period s consumption  or trending and are adjusted to reflect current changes in water demand on a system wide basis 
while actual usage for individual customers may differ materially from the estimate  we believe the overall total estimate of consumption and revenue for the fiscal period will not differ materially from actual billed consumption  as the overall estimate has been adjusted to reflect any change in overall demand on the system for the period 
we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts 
the reserve for bad debts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable  and is determined based on a five year historical write off experience 
the company reviews the reserve for bad debts on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the reserve when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review for impairment of our long lived assets  including utility plant in service  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also review regulatory assets for the continued application of sfas no 
our review determines whether there have been changes in circumstances or events that have occurred that require adjustments to the carrying value of these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 adjustments to the carrying value of these assets would be made in instances where the inclusion in the rate making process is unlikely 
our regulated utilities record deferred regulatory assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which are costs that may be recovered over various lengths of time as prescribed by the psc  mdpsc and pennsylvania public utility commission or the papuc 
as the utility incurs certain costs  such as expenses related to rate case applications  a deferred regulatory asset is created 
adjustments to these deferred regulatory assets are made when the psc  mdpsc or papuc determines whether the expense is recoverable in rates  the length of time over which an expense is recoverable  or  because of changes in circumstances  whether a remaining balance of deferred expense is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
adjustments to reflect changes in recoverability of certain deferred regulatory assets may have a material effect on our financial results

non utility operating revenue non utility operating revenue  derived from non regulated wastewater operations  increased from million in to million in this increase reflects higher contract revenues associated with wastewater treatment projects in southern delaware 
the increase is also due to an increase in artesian utility operations  which had a  increase for the construction of a water treatment facility in cecil county  maryland 
a portion of the increase  approximately  includes contract service revenue in artesian utility as a result of the tmh acquisition 
the increase in revenue also includes an increase in slp plan revenue  approximately  from  in to  in operating expenses operating expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  increased approximately million  or  to million in payroll and benefits increased  due to increased staffing at points throughout the year  pay increases and medical insurance premiums

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity for were million provided by cash flow from operating activities  million in net contributions and advances from developers  and million net proceeds from the issuance of approximately  shares of class a non voting common stock 
cash flow from operating activities is primarily provided by our utility operations  and is impacted by the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases and changes in water consumption as a result of year to year variations in weather conditions  particularly during the summer 
a significant part of our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is to assure our investments in utility plant and equipment are recovered in the rates charged to customers 
as such  from time to time we file rate increase requests to recover increases in operating expenses and investments in utility plant and equipment 
during  our cash flows from operating activities were impacted by the refund of temporary rates plus interest  as required by law  as a result of artesian water s rate case 
we depend on the availability of capital for expansion  construction and maintenance 
we rely on our sources of liquidity for investments in our utility plant and to meet our various payment obligations 
we expect that our aggregate investments in our utility plant and systems in will be approximately million 
our total obligations related to interest and principal payments on indebtedness  rental payments and water service interconnection agreements for are anticipated to be approximately million 
we expect to fund our activities for the next year using our available cash balances and bank credit lines  and projected cash generated from operations and the capital markets 
investment in utility plant and systems we invested million in capital expenditures during compared to million invested during the same period in investment in utility plant  excluding advances and contributions in aid of construction received from real estate developers  was million in compared to million in additionally  developers financed million for the installation of water mains and hydrants in compared to million in these reduced investments are attributable to several factors  including value engineering of capital projects  regionalization to avoid construction of new facilities  greater competition and thus lower bid prices received on construction contracts  and  to a lesser extent  the general slowdown in the housing market 
the primary focus of artesian water s investment was to continue to provide high quality reliable service to our growing service territory 

table of contents we invested approximately million in new transmission and distribution facilities in  including refunds of advances for developer financed infrastructure 
of the million invested  we invested million in new infrastructure and million in our rehabilitation program for transmission and distribution facilities  replacing aging or deteriorating mains 
additionally  an investment of million was made to enhance or improve existing treatment facilities  rehabilitate pumping equipment and install new wells to increase supply capabilities 
the following chart summarizes our investment in utility plant and systems over the past three fiscal years

of the million we expect to invest in  approximately million will be for new treatment facilities  equipment and wells throughout delaware to identify  develop  treat and protect sources of water supply to assure uninterrupted service to our customers 
the largest portion of the projected investment in  million  will be in transmission and distribution facilities 
approximately million of this amount will be invested in the relocations of facilities as a result of government mandates and renewals associated with the rehabilitation of aging infrastructure 
the remaining million of this investment in new transmission and distribution facilities will be to improve our system hydraulics and address service needs in growth areas of our service territory 
we plan to construct two new water storage tanks in kent county  delaware  investing million in the magnolia area and million in the clayton area 
we also plan to invest million in a water storage tank in sussex county  delaware 
an additional expenditure of approximately million is anticipated to complete the construction of a new office building addition to our corporate headquarters in new castle county in  to meet our growing space requirements 
an additional million will be spent on wastewater projects in sussex county  delaware 
we plan to initiate capital investment in the growth corridor in cecil county  maryland  starting with million to upgrade the artesian maryland water system purchased from the carpenters point water company in additionally  million is planned to be invested in new transmission mains to provide water supply to the cecil county  maryland growth area 
financing we have several sources of liquidity to finance our investment in utility plant and other fixed assets 
we estimate that the projected investment of approximately million will be financed by our operations and external sources  including a combination of capital investment  short term borrowings under our revolving credit agreements discussed below  as well as a debt issuance 
developers are expected to finance  through contributions in aid of construction  an additional million of capital expenditures  which includes the installation of mains and hydrants in new developments 
our cash flows from operations are primarily derived from water sales revenues and may be materially affected by changes in water sales due to weather and the timing and extent of increases in rates approved by the psc 

table of contents at december   artesian water had lines of credit of million each with two separate financial institutions totaling million to meet temporary cash requirements 
these revolving credit facilities are unsecured 
as of december   we had million of available funds under these lines  as we used the proceeds from the june common stock issuance to pay off the then outstanding balance
