critical accounting policies the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues which require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
cash and cash equivalents cash consists of currency held at reputable financial institutions 
short term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
inventory inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market utilizing first in  first out fifo cost flow assumption 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
inventory reserve we maintain an allowance against inventory for the potential future obsolescence or excess inventory that is based on our estimate of future sales 
a substantial decrease in expected demand for our products  or decreases in our selling prices could lead to excess or overvalued inventories and could require us to substantially increase our allowance for excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the assessment of the ultimate realization of accounts receivable including the current credit worthiness of each customer is subject to a considerable degree to the judgment of our management 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
stock based compensation the company calculates stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this pronouncement requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options to be based on estimated fair values 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

persuasive evidence of an arrangement the company documents all terms of an arrangement in a written contract signed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue 

table of contents delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the company performs all services or delivers all products prior to recognizing revenue 
professional consulting and engineering services are considered to be performed when the services are complete 
equipment is considered delivered upon delivery to a customer s designated location 
in certain instances  the customer elects to take title upon shipment 
the fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue  a customer s fee is either fixed or determinable under the terms of the written contract

existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined during the arrangement that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized on a cash basis 
additionally  in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  amounts received upfront for engineering or development fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of committed services or performance  if such arrangements require the company to provide on going services or performance 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research and development contracts are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board issue eitf issue addressed the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  the company applies the principles of issue to multiple element agreements 
the company also recognizes engineering and construction contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
customer furnished materials  labor  and equipment  and in certain cases subcontractor materials  labor  and equipment  are included in revenues and cost of revenues when management believes that the company is responsible for the ultimate acceptability of the project 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts received are classified as current assets under contract work in progress 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to engineering and development contract costs and revenue 
these accounting policies were applied consistently for all periods presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results is included in the footnotes to our financial statements 
several other factors related to the company may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year 
for example  the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition related to product contracts are complex and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction 
factors such as acceptance of services provided  payment terms  creditworthiness of the customer  and timing of delivery or acceptance of our products often cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods 
for arrangements in which services revenue is deferred  related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred

table of contents we did continue several development projects throughout the year  the process by which management selected which development projects were accepted in largely depended on our assessment of which contracts had the greatest potential for a production relationship 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  integration costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
product development costs incurred in the performance of engineering development contracts for the us government and private companies are charged to cost of sales 
our customers continue to require additional integration and support services to customize  integrate  and evaluate our products 
we believe that a portion of these costs are initial  one time costs for these customers and anticipate similar costs to be incurred with respect to new customers as we gain additional market share 
customers who have been using our products over one year do not typically incur this same type of initial costs 
gross profit margin 
the gross profit margin for was negative compared to a negative in the prior year
