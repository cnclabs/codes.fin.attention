critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred according to contract terms 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as well as the customer s payment history 

table of contents returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
impairment of long lived assets or goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
when applying the impairment rules we use estimates to determine when an impairment is necessary 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform our annual impairment test in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  each fourth quarter 
retirement plans approximately half of our domestic employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the remaining employees covered by defined contribution plans 
most of our foreign employees are covered by government sponsored plans in the countries in which they are employed 
our obligations under our domestic defined benefit plans are determined with the assistance of actuarial firms 
the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide us with information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit plans may change significantly from year to year 
based on our annual review of actuarial assumptions as well as historical rates of return on plan assets and existing long term bond rates  we set the long term rate of return on plan assets at and an average discount rate at approximately for our defined benefit plans as of december  see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements
