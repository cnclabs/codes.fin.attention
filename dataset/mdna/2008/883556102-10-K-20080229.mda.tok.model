if the merger with fisher had occurred on january   revenues would have increased million  over pro forma revenues 
aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made by both companies and currency translation discussed in total and by segment below  revenues increased over pro forma revenues by million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand  discussed below  and  to a lesser extent  price increases 
the company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in and in addition to the merger with fisher  the principal acquisitions included la pha pack  a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in december  priority solutions international  a third party provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in october  nanodrop technologies  inc  a supplier of uv vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in october  qualigens fine chemicals  a chemical manufacturer and supplier in september and cohesive technologies inc  a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in december in  the company s operating income and operating income margin were million and  respectively  compared with million and  respectively  in operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to equity investments  bad debts  sales returns  inventories  business combinations  intangible assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  pension costs  contingencies and litigation  stock based compensation  restructuring and sale of businesses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b inventories the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding months  expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of significant judgment in determining i fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized 
the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
amortizable intangible assets totaled billion at december  the company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in 
financial statement index 
table of contents cash flows associated with the assets 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 
the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled billion and billion  respectively  at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
d other long lived assets the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled billion at december   including billion of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary 
e revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected 
if fair value is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements 
in the event 
financial statement index 
table of contents vsoe is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed  based on vsoe  which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers 
should a greater or lesser number of products be returned  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
f warranty obligations at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
g income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest expense has also been recognized 
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and  as a result  is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non us tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income 
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions 
financial statement index 
table of contents in which it operates 
accrued income taxes totaled million at december  should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained  a reduction in the company s tax provision or goodwill would result 
h contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies  including legal proceedings  environmental  workers compensation  product  general and auto liabilities  self insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the accruals are based on management s judgment  historical claims experience  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates 
reserves of fisher as of the merger date  including environmental reserves  were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value 
additionally  we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 
i pension and other retiree benefits several of the company s us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled million in and the company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at year end should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately million 
j stock based compensation the fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected lives of grants through were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options as permitted by sab thereafter  historical data on exercise patterns will become the basis for determining the expected life of an option 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
the compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures 
if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures  adjustments to compensation expense may be required

table of contents k restructuring costs the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income 
the company s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled million at december  should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts  adjustments may be required 
l assets held for sale the company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and  when necessary  records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value 
should the actual or estimated proceeds  which would include post closing purchase price adjustments  vary from current estimates  results could differ from expected amounts

discontinued operations subsequent to the acquisition of gv instruments limited gvi  the uk office of fair trading oft commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for consideration under the uk enterprise act 
on december   the oft referred the transaction to the uk competition commission for further investigation under the enterprise act to determine whether the transaction had resulted in  or may be expected to result in  a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the uk for goods or services  particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers gas irms  thermal ionization mass spectrometers tims and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers 
the competition commission published its final report on may   concluding that the company s acquisition of gvi would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the uk in the markets for gas irms and tims products 
the competition commission has further concluded that a divestiture remedy was appropriate and has therefore required the company to divest of either gvi as a whole  or its gas irms and tims assets which together comprise the majority of the business  to purchasers approved by the competition commission
