overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes 
on march   we received approval from the fda for our first product  the sts  designed for up to three days of continuous use 
on may   we received approval from the fda for our second generation continuous glucose monitoring system  the seven  designed for up to seven days of continuous use  and we began commercializing this product in the third quarter of as part of our commercialization of the seven  we discontinued sales of our sts three day durable system in the second quarter of we continue to sell three day disposable sensors to customers who previously purchased the sts durable system  and expect to discontinue sales of the three day sensors during our approval allows for the use of the seven by adults with diabetes to detect trends and track glucose patterns  to aid in the detection of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and to facilitate acute and long term therapy adjustments 
our products must be prescribed by a physician and include a disposable sensor  a transmitter and a small handheld receiver 
our products are indicated for use as adjunctive devices to complement  not replace  information obtained from standard home blood glucose monitoring devices and our products must be calibrated periodically using a standard home blood glucose monitor 
on november   we received fda approval to calibrate the seven using any fda cleared blood glucose meter and we began shipping receivers with this feature in the first quarter of previously  patients were required to calibrate the seven using a lifescan ultra blood glucose meter connected to the receiver via an upload cable 
the seven sensor is inserted by the patient and is intended to be used continuously for up to seven days after which it is removed by the patient and may be replaced by a new sensor 
our transmitter and receiver are reusable 
since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
more recently  we have devoted considerable resources to the commercialization of the seven as well as the continued research and clinical development of our technology platform 
according to the world health organization  in there were approximately million people who suffered from diabetes worldwide 
in  there were an estimated million people in the united states with diabetes of which million have been diagnosed 
we estimate that approximately million of these patients were insulin dependent 
in  million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed 
the increased prevalence of diabetes is a result of an aging population  unhealthy diets and increasingly sedentary lifestyles 
according to an article published in diabetes care in  diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death by disease in the united states  and complications related to diabetes include heart disease  limb amputations  loss of kidney function and blindness 

table of contents according to the ada  the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the united states were an estimated billion in  an increase of billion since of the billion in overall expenses  the ada estimates that approximately billion were direct medical costs 
according to industry sources  the worldwide market for personal glucose monitoring systems and related disposables  which include test strips and lancets  was approximately billion in  and is expected to grow to billion in we have built a direct sales organization to call on endocrinologists  physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring 
we believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision making process for diabetes therapy 
we currently sell the seven only in the united states  but plan to expand our sales into europe and elsewhere in the future 
to complement our direct sales efforts  we also employ clinical specialists who educate and provide clinical support in the field 
we believe our direct  highly specialized and focused sales organization is sufficient for us to support our sales efforts and have no immediate plans to increase the size of the sales organization 
we provide hour technical support as well as customer support during regular business hours 
we are leveraging our technology platform to enhance the capabilities of our current products and to develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products 
we are continuing clinical development of a third generation product which we expect will further improve sensor reliability  stability and accuracy over the useful life of the sensor  and will be more comfortable for patients to wear 
we also intend to seek approval for a pediatric indication patients under years of age for our product platform in the future 
in addition  we are developing a product platform specifically for the in hospital glucose monitoring market  with an initial focus on the development of an intravenous sensor specifically for the critical care market 
despite our continued efforts in these areas  our development timelines are highly dependent on our clinical trials  which may be delayed due to scheduling issues with patients and investigators  institutional review boards  sensor performance and manufacturing supply constraints  among other factors 
in addition  support of these clinical trials requires significant resources from employees involved in the production of our seven  including research and development  manufacturing  quality assurance  and clinical and regulatory personnel 
even if our development and clinical trial efforts are successful  the fda may not approve our products  and if approved  we may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and patients 
since our first commercial launch in  we have experienced field failures  including  but not limited to  periods of higher than expected out of box sensor initialization failures and certain component failures in our electronics which may prevent data transmission from the sensor to the handheld receiver 
we do not believe these failures have created any patient safety concerns and we are not aware of any reports of adverse events or incidents related to these failures 
although we believe we have taken appropriate actions aimed at reducing or eliminating field failures  there can be no assurances that we will not experience these or other failures going forward 
as a medical device company  reimbursement from medicare and private third party healthcare payors is an important element of our success 
our seven does not yet have broad reimbursement by medicare or private third party payors and is generally not approved for insurance coverage 
until reimbursement or insurance coverage is established  patients will have to bear the financial cost of our seven 
in order to establish reimbursement or insurance coverage for our seven  we believe that we need to develop an established base of users  gain the support of advocacy groups and show the benefits of our system through clinical data generated by clinical trials 
on november   the centers for medicare and medicaid  or cms  released its alpha numeric hcpcs file  which included three separate codes applicable to each of the three components of our continuous glucose monitoring systems  and hcpcs codes for continuous glucose monitoring became effective on january  hcpcs codes are billing codes used by medicare and private third party payors  but do not represent a reimbursement coverage decision by cms 
we currently employ in house reimbursement expertise to assist physicians and patients in obtaining reimbursement from private third party payors 
we also 
table of contents maintain a field based reimbursement team charged with calling on third party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and contracts 
we have had formal meetings and have increased our efforts to create coverage policies with third party payors during and expect to continue these efforts in however  unless government and other third party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  patients may not use them 
we currently manufacture our devices at our headquarters in san diego  california  and another facility located nearby 
in these facilities we have more than  square feet of laboratory space and approximately  square feet of controlled environment rooms 
in january  both our facilities were subject to a post approval pma and qsr audit by the fda 
based on the results of this inspection  we believe we are in substantial compliance with the regulatory requirements for a commercial medical device manufacturer and there were no major observations from the fda resulting from this audit 
at the close of the inspection  the fda issued a form identifying several inspectional observations and  although we have no formal requirements or obligations to provide anything further to the fda regarding these observations  we voluntarily provided formal written evidence to the fda of our actions taken to address these minor observations 
we manufacture our seven with components supplied by outside vendors and with parts manufactured internally 
key components that we manufacture internally include our wire based sensor for our seven 
the remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors 
we then assemble  test  package and ship the finished product  which includes a reusable transmitter  a receiver and a disposable sensor 
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in our two facilities in san diego  california 
our capacity expansion could be constrained by the lack of material availability  equipment design  production and validation  regulatory approval of any required additional facilities  personnel staffing and other factors 
revenues are generated from sales of our seven transmitter and receiver and from the recurring sales of disposable sensors 
the seven s sensor is inserted by the patient and intended to be used continuously for up to seven days  after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor 
our seven transmitter and receiver are reusable 
in the event we establish an installed base of patients using our seven  we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors 
we recognize revenue on our products upon shipment and our sales terms provide for customer payment at the time of order 
through december   we had generated million of revenue  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in may through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue and increase as we expand our clinical trial activities and continue commercialization activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of equity securities and convertible debt 
in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement  and as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million 
in may  we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in march  we issued an aggregate principal amount of  in convertible senior notes due in financial operations revenue from inception through december   we generated million in revenue from the sale of our continuous glucose monitoring systems 
we expect that revenues we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
cost of sales cost of sales includes direct labor and material costs related to each product sold or produced  including assembly and test labor and scrap  as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations 
factory 
table of contents overhead includes facilities  material procurement and control  manufacturing engineering  quality control  supervision and management 
these costs are primarily salary  fringe benefits  stock based compensation  facility expense  supplies and purchased services 
the majority of our costs are currently fixed due to the relatively low production volumes compared to our potential capacity 
from our inception until december   all of our manufacturing costs were included in research and development expense due to our development stage during that period 
from january  these costs are included in cost of sales 
research and development our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology  clinical trials  regulatory expenses  materials and products for clinical trials 
until december  our manufacturing costs were included in research and development expense 
research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation  including salary  fringe benefits  recruitment  stock based compensation  relocation and temporary employee expenses 
we also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including trial design  clinical site reimbursement  data management  clinical trial product and associated travel expenses 
our research and development expenses also include fees for design services  contractors and development materials 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to support the development and clinical trials of additional products 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary  fringe benefits and stock based compensation for our executive  financial  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
other significant expenses include trade show expenses  sales samples  insurance  professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors  litigation expenses and expenses for board meetings 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support the commercialization of our seven 
results of operations fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross margin 
revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million during the same period in following the launch of our first product in march of and our second generation product in june of cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the twelve months ending december  the increase in cost of sales in was primarily attributed to supporting increased product sales and included million in additional fixed overhead spending 
the gross margin loss of million for the twelve months ended december  decreased  compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in development expenses decreased million and clinical and regulatory costs decreased by  major elements of declining research and development costs include  in lower tooling and fixture costs   in lower facilities costs  and  in lower share based compensation costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in expense was primarily due to million in higher sales costs incurred for the entirety of fiscal  compared to lower levels incurred during fiscal when we began building our sales force 
the million increase in selling related costs was partially offset by million in lower marketing costs 
major 
table of contents changes in selling  general and administrative expense included million in additional payroll related costs  offset by million in lower legal expense and  in lower trade show costs 
during   in separation payments to our former ceo and cfo were included within personnel expenses along with an additional  for their extended vesting and post employment exercise period that was included within share based compensation costs 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased million to  million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in net interest income and expense was primarily due to million in additional interest expense attributed to the million aggregate principal convertible senior notes we issued in march of  offset by higher average cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities balances during fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross margin 
we recorded revenues of million for the twelve months ending december  after launching our first product on march  no revenues were recorded in cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ending december  compared to zero for the twelve months ending december  the million of cost of sales for the twelve months ending december  reflects a million increase compared to the million of these expenses that were included in research and development expense during included in the costs were a charge of million to write down component inventory to the lower of cost or market value 
the increase in cost of sales during fiscal was primarily related to variable costs to produce our revenues including a million increase in compensation expense  million in increased scrap and million in increased depreciation  offset by million in lower expensed materials and a benefit of million for materials purchased in and utilized in research and development 
research and development expense  including stock based compensation  decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in development expenses increased million and clinical and regulatory costs increased million and these increases were more than offset by a million decrease in manufacturing expenses that are now classified in cost of sales for changes in research and development and clinical expenses were driven by million in increased compensation expenses  and  in increased facility and depreciation costs  partially offset by million in lower outside design costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense  including share based compensation  increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to million in higher sales and marketing costs and million in higher administrative costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative expense were driven by million in increased compensation costs  primarily in sales and marketing due to our having hired a direct sales force in  million in increased advertising and promotions and million in increased legal expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was due to higher combined average cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities balances due to our april follow on public offering partially offset by  in interest expense on our bank equipment line 
liquidity and capital resources we are in the early commercialization stage and have incurred losses since our inception in may as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had working capital of million  which included million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
we 
table of contents have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities and our bank line  raising aggregate net proceeds of million from equity sales and million from debt issuances through december  in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement that provided for a loan of up to million to finance various equipment purchases 
on april   the loan converted into a month amortized term loan 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million under this loan 
on may  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
on march   we completed a million offering of our convertible senior notes due after payment of related expenses  including the purchase of a related call option hedge  we received net proceeds of million 
on january   we amended our bank equipment loan to enable us to draw an additional million through january at which time the additional amount drawn will be amortized over a month term through july net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to million less cash used to pay down payables and accrued liabilities and million less cash invested in inventories 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period of the decrease was primarily due to million in lower net purchases and sales of short term marketable securities 
for the twelve months ending december   we invested million in equipment and facilities to support manufacturing improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period of the decrease was primarily due to raising million less in net debt and equity financing during than during operating capital and capital expenditure requirements in the third quarter of  we commercialized our second product  the seven 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the next several years as we incur expenses related to the commercialization of the seven  the development of new continuous glucose monitoring products  and the expansion of our sales  marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances  and the interest we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements with respect to the commercialization of our seven  clinical trials  pma applications and to meet our other anticipated cash needs for if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and the funds available under our loan and security agreement are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring technologies  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and 
table of contents operating expenditures associated with our current research and development and commercialization efforts 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the revenue generated by sales of our seven and other future products  the expenses we incur in manufacturing  developing  selling and marketing our products  the quality levels of our products and services  potential reimbursement to purchasers of our products by third party payors  our ability to efficiently scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products  the costs to produce our monitoring systems  the costs and timing of additional regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  defending the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by abbott  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in a private offering 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
interest on the notes is due semiannually on march and september of each year at a rate of per year 
the notes will be redeemable by us beginning march  at a price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash equal to of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain designated events  including a change of control 
in addition  we will have the right to automatically convert the notes if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price or per share  for at least trading days during any day period 
if such an automatic conversion occurs before march   we are required to pay additional interest in cash or  at our option  in shares of our common stock 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash on march   march  and march  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million due on our bank equipment loan 
we are required to repay the outstanding balance in monthly installments through september on january   we amended our bank equipment loan to enable us to draw an additional million through january at which time the additional amount drawn will be amortized over a month term through july in april  we entered into an office lease agreement for approximately  square feet of additional facilities located in san diego  ca 
we also have a five year option to renew the lease upon the expiration of the 
table of contents initial term 
in connection with the lease  we entered into a  letter of credit to secure future payments under the lease and paid a security deposit in the amount of  in april excluding real estate taxes and operating costs  we are required to make future monthly payments for the period from december through april totaling million 
our facility leases have annual rental escalation clauses and are expensed on a straight line basis 
we are party to various purchase arrangements related to components used in production and research and development activities 
as of december   we had purchase commitments with certain vendors totaling approximately million of which million was due within one year and the remaining due within two years 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating leases royalty obligations purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
related party transactions our chairman is a director of oracle corporation 
we incurred costs totaling   and  relating to an oracle erp system for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the chairman was not involved in the selection of the company s erp system 
we believe that the aforementioned arrangement was at no less favorable rates to us than those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties based on review of price quotations with third parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition we sell durable systems and disposable units through a direct sales force in the united states 
components are individually priced and can be purchased separately or together 
the seven durable system includes a transmitter  a receiver  a power cord  a finger stick meter interface cable  data management software and a usb cable 
disposable sensors for use with the seven are sold separately in packages of four 
the initial seven durable system price is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable seven sensors 
we discontinued sales of our sts day durable system in the second quarter of we continue to sell three day disposable sensors to customers who previously purchased the sts day durable system and expect to discontinue sales of the three day sensors in disposable sensors for use with the sts day durable system are sold separately in packages of five 
revenue on product sales is recognized upon shipment  which is when title and the risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
our products are generally paid for at the time of shipment using a customer s credit card and do not include customer acceptance provisions 
after approval of our second generation continuous glucose monitoring system  the seven  on may   we started taking orders for an upgrade kit to upgrade existing customers for for systems sold that included an upgrade right  a portion of the sales price was allocated to the undelivered upgrade and deferred based on the fair value of the upgrade kit 
this deferred revenue is recognized when the upgrade has been delivered to the customer 
deferred revenue as of december  totaled approximately  in august  we adopted a day money back guarantee program whereby customers who purchase the seven durable system and a package of four disposable sensors may return the seven durable system for any reason within thirty days of purchase and receive a full refund of their purchase price 
we accrue for estimated returns and or refunds by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
share based compensation our share based employee compensation plans are described in the notes to our financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under apb and sfas  for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the securities and exchange commission issued sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our statement of operations as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
share based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  was related to the grant of certain options to employees during which represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price at the date of grant accounted for in accordance with apb as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding options that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
prior to january   we had adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas accordingly  we had not previously recognized compensation expense  except for share based compensation expense accounted for in accordance with apb 
table of contents sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods as share based compensation expense in the company s statement of operations 
for the years ended december  and  the statement of operations included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of share based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations in fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
as permitted by sfas r  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for share based awards granted 
the black scholes model was previously utilized for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented deferred compensation as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  on january  we reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid in capital on our balance sheet 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  for estimated excess  obsolete and potential scrapped inventories 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventories by identifying the amount of on hand and on order materials and comparing those to expected future sales for the next twelve months  taking into account clinical trial and development usage along with new product introductions 
we utilize a standard cost system to track inventories on a part by part basis that approximates first in  first out 
if necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs 
the labor and overhead elements of our standard costs are based on full utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical study expenses  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations  physicians and participating hospitals 
these expenses can be a significant 
table of contents component of research and development expenses 
we accrue expenses for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
expenses for setting up clinical trial sites and study initiation are accrued immediately 
clinical expenses related to patient enrollment and ongoing monitoring are accrued as the trials progress 
warranty accrual we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of shipment 
we estimate warranty accruals by analyzing the timing  cost and amount of returned product 
we evaluate assumptions and historical warranty experience on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of such assumptions 
bonus accrual for the bonus plan  the compensation committee authorized an amount of up to of salary and wages for non sales employees to be awarded from the pool based on the weighted average achievement measured against certain objectives 
as targets were not met  no bonuses were paid under the bonus plan 
subsequently  the compensation committee approved bonuses for totaling  of  in bonuses accrued during   was reversed during the fourth quarter of based on management s determinations at that time 
income taxes in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we adopted fin as of january  due to the valuation allowance  the adoption of fin did not impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded a net decrease to deferred tax assets of approximately million and a corresponding reduction to valuation allowance 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits in thousands balance at january  increases related to current year tax positions balance at december  due to the valuation allowance  none of the unrecognized tax benefits as of december   would reduce our annual effective tax rate 
we do not expect unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
we file income tax returns in the united states and in various state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
due to net operating losses incurred  our tax returns from inception to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had no interest or penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  but does not require any new fair value measurement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  that the adoption of sfas no

because sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements or remeasurements of previously computed fair values  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  us treasury debt and corporate debt securities 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
to date we have recorded no product sales and have not entered into any agreements denominated in other than us dollars 
accordingly we believe we have no material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates
