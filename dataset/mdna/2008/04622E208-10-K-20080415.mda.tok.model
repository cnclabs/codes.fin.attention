software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily knowledge management mapping and analytical software licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred

restatement in conjunction with the preparation of the form k  management identified errors in accounting for certain license contracts the contracts which were executed in and in the second and third quarters of  certain sales contracts four in total included add on analytical modules that had not  at that time  been released 
these contracts consisted of numerous licenses and modules that were purchased by customers and delivered to them in the quarters in which the company recognized the revenues related to the contracts 
included in the contracts were two or three insignificant add on modules for an analytical tool 
the main component of the tool and one of the analytical modules were included in the delivery of the software to the customers 
however  there were one or two analytical modules that could not be delivered with the software 
the company originally estimated a value for the undelivered modules and deferred the revenues related to these modules until they were delivered  which occurred in the first and second quarters of management identified a similar error in the accounting for a contract entered into in the customer had been promised a specified upgrade to an unreleased version 
at the time the company filed its and forms k  the company estimated a value for the upgrade and deferred that amount of revenue until the upgrade could be delivered 
in conjunction with the preparation of the form k  management determined that it did not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for the undelivered insignificant add on module software licenses and the specified upgrade 
according to american institute of certified public accountants  aicpa sop software revenue recognition and related statements  undelivered elements to a sale must have vsoe in order to recognize revenue for the delivered elements that do not have vsoe 
the company uses the residual method for recognizing revenues on its software licenses 
in such instances  the accounting rules state that if vsoe for undelivered software modules cannot be determined  then all revenue related to that sale must be deferred until the undelivered elements are delivered 
accordingly  all revenues  including license  service and maintenance revenues  must be deferred until the delivery and acceptance of the final undelivered element 
therefore  the company restated its consolidated financial statements for and to defer all license revenues and service and maintenance revenues recognized in and in relation to the contracts 
the undelivered modules and specified upgrade were delivered in the first and second quarters of upon the final delivery  all deferred revenues were recognized 
the effect of this restatement is to reduce revenue by  in and by  in and recognize revenue amounting to  in all cash related to these transactions was received by december  the company s policy is to recognize expenses as incurred when revenues are deferred in connection with transactions where vsoe cannot be established for an undelivered element as the company follows the accounting requirements of sop accordingly  all costs associated with the contract were recorded in the period when incurred  which differs from the period in which the associated revenue was recognized 
in addition the company determined that a software implementation agreement contained a reference to an unreleased upgrade of the software 
the software licensing agreement and the software implementation agreement were signed in the third and fourth quarter of respectively 
based on aicpa technical practice aid  software recognition for multiple element arrangements  under certain conditions  multiple agreements between a vendor and customer should be considered as one agreement 
in this case  it was determined that the project implementation plan should be considered as part of the original software licensing agreement 
since the implementation plan referred to an unreleased version of the company s software for which no vsoe exists  all revenue related to the transaction  including license and services and maintenance should be deferred until the specified upgrade is delivered 
accordingly   of revenue  consisting of  of license revenue and  of professional services and maintenance revenue will be deferred from the third quarter of the upgrade was delivered to the customer in the first quarter of it is expected that all of the deferred revenue related to this contract will be recognized at that time 
as a result of these determinations  we restated our financial statements and quarterly results of operations unaudited included in this annual report 
in addition we will restate the consolidated interim financial statements for the and periods contained in our quarterly reports on form q 
the modifications contained in the restated financial statements relate to revenue and deferred revenues 
it affected the elements of cash flow  but did not have any impact to net cash flow from operations as reported in the statements of cash flows 
these restated financial statements reflect an increase in basic net loss per share of 
for the year ended december  and a decrease in net income per share of 
for the year ended december  in connection with the preparation of the form k  an error in the company s accounting for revenue recognition relating to a particular contract from was identified 
in the fourth quarter of  our uk subsidiary entered into a contract with a new customer 
in  the company recognized all of the license revenue 
in and the first three quarters of  the company recognized services and maintenance revenue based on work performed for the customer 
however  the contract contained a specified upgrade right  which was delivered in the first quarter of according to accounting requirements  a specified upgrade right must be valued using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company uses the residual method for recognizing revenue on its software licenses 
in such instances  the accounting rules state that vsoe for a specified upgrade right cannot be determined and therefore  revenue must be deferred until all elements of the arrangement which would include the specified upgrade are delivered 
although the specified upgrade was delivered in the first quarter of  changes in the customer s requirements and subsequent concessions granted by the company in october which included an additional specified upgrade right  further delayed our ability to establish that delivery and acceptance of the license had occurred 
this additional specified upgrade was delivered in the first quarter of accordingly all revenue  including license  service and maintenance should have been deferred until the delivery and acceptance of the final element 
therefore  the company restated its financial statements to defer all license  service and maintenance revenue recognized in relation to this contract in  and the first three quarters of  which was   and  respectively 
the company s policy is to recognize expenses as incurred when revenues are deferred in connection with transactions where vsoe cannot be established for an undelivered element as the company follows the accounting requirements of sop accordingly  all costs associated with the contract were recorded in the period when incurred  which differs from the period in which the associated revenue will be recognized 
all revenue related to this contract was recognized in  with the exception of certain post contract support revenue totaling  which will be recognized ratably over all cash related to the transaction   has been received by the company as of december  as a result of this determination  we restated our financial statements and quarterly results of operations unaudited included in this annual report 
in addition we restated the consolidated interim financial statements for the periods contained in our quarterly reports on form q 
the modifications contained in the restated financial statements relate to revenue and deferred revenues 
it affected the elements of cash flow  but did not have any impact to net cash flow from operations as reported in the statements of cash flows 
these restated financial statements reflect a decrease in the basic net income per share of 
for the year ended december  and a decrease in the basic and diluted net income per share of 
and  respectively for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
astea recognizes revenue on its software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
astea recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria are required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
in june  the fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not change our policy of presenting taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts regarding accounts receivable the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
capitalized software and research and development costs the company accounts for its internal software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company capitalizes software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  other headcount related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers 
the company s estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances had occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of september it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exists  using a fair value based approach 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the operating unit level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the assumptions we used to estimate fair value of goodwill change  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
share based compensation option plans beginning on january   the company began accounting for stock options under the provision of sfas r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
the fair value of stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
we elected the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested 
the adoption of sfas r has impacted our consolidated statement of operations through the recognition of share based compensation expenses in cost of services and maintenance  development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
future periods are expected to reflect similar costs 
prior to the adoption of sfas r no stock based compensation cost had been recorded 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated primarily by operating losses 
accordingly  it is more likely than not  that we will not realize these assets through future operations 
on january   we implemented the provisions of fas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense 
such amounts were not material for  and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r which replaces fas no  business combinations 
fas r retains the underlying concepts of fas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but fas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
changes prescribed by fas r include  but are not limited to  requirements to expense transaction costs and costs to restructure acquired entities  record earn outs and other forms of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date  record of the net assets acquired even if less than a controlling interest is acquired  and to recognize any excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration as a gain to the acquirer 
fas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
fas r amends fas such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of fas r would also apply the provisions of fas r 
early adoption is not allowed 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that fas r may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements fas 
fas amends accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
fas also clarifies that all of those transactions resulting in a change in ownership of a subsidiary are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
fas requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
fas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
fas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that fas may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to understand more easily the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  and are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fas no  fair value measurement fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for years beginning after november  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

additionally  there was an increase in service and maintenance revenue of  from the company s fieldcentrix customer base 
the increase in fieldcentrix service and maintenance revenue resulted from services connected to license sales in and partially offsetting the increases to service and maintenance revenues is a decrease in dispatch revenues of  due to the decreasing demand for dispatch professional services and the lack of any related product development by the company  the decrease in service and maintenance revenue is expected to continue beyond in two customers represented and of total revenues respectfully 
in  no customer represented more than of total revenues 
in  one customer accounted for of the company s revenues 
costs of revenues 
costs of software license fee revenues increased to  in from  in the increase results from increased amortization of capitalized software development costs and increases in the cost of third party software licenses embedded in our software

the gross margin percentage on software license sales is in and in the improvement in the margin results from the increase in license revenue in the costs of services and maintenance revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in cost of services and maintenance is primarily attributed to an increase in the professional services staff in the us which was necessary to meet the increased demand from the company s new and existing customer base for new license implementations as well as the extensive upgrade to customer systems from older versions of astea alliance to the latest released version 
in  the company recognized  in share based compensation expense for employees compared to  in in addition  the company invested in additional support staff to improve the timing and quality of support provided to its customers 
the service and maintenance gross margin percentage increased to in from in the increased margin is primarily attributable to increased billable projects and the recognition of  of service and maintenance revenue deferred from and related to undelivered software elements where the cost of providing the services occurred in and accordingly  future service and maintenance margins are not expected to remain as high as those recognized in product development 
product development expenses increased  or  to  in from  in development costs increased due to an increased focus on improving the quality of products and a decrease of  in development costs capitalized compared to additionally   in share based compensation expense for employees was recorded at december  compared to  expense for year ending december  product development as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in this decrease is due to the growth in revenue in exceeding the growth in product development costs

the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on the company s current year and historical operating losses  the company determined maintaining a full valuation allowance was appropriate 
the company made a provision of  in and  in  for income taxes which resulted from a difference between an indefinite lived asset  goodwill  which is amortized for tax  but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
international operations 
total revenues from the company s international operations increased  or to  in from  in part of the increase in revenue from international operations was attributable to the recognition in of  in license  service and maintenance revenues which had been deferred from a transaction that occurred with a customer in and continued through excluding the revenue recognized in from the uk customer that had been deferred from previous years  total revenue from international operations is  which is a increase over the same period in the increase in revenues also results from a significant increase in professional services in europe and license sales in the asia pacific region

the increase in international net income of  is the direct result of the increase in service and maintenance revenues and the recognition of deferred revenues from through for which all related costs had been recognized in prior years 
profit margins recognized in are not expected to be as high in future years 
net income loss
