item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
please refer to item a of this form k for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to january  which results in some fiscal years with weeks and some with weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
fiscal years and each were comprised of weeks 
operating results summary the following are the results from weeks that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in weeks 
comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of increased 
sales per selling square foot were in both and net sales declined 
gross margin as a percent of sales decreased basis points to of sales from of sales in gross margin dollars were lower by

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters 
in  we recorded pretax income of million less than basis points in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees paid for certain visa and mastercard transactions 
seasonality we historically have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations  with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit being realized in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings  the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing of television and circular advertising  and the timing of certain holidays 
we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs as a percent of sales in the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit by fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year operating strategy in august  we introduced our operating strategy called the what s important now win strategy 
the win strategy is comprised of distinctive phases discovery  testing and learning  and execution 
the discovery phase second half of included tactical decisions to improve near term performance along with the development of strategic changes to be implemented or tested during throughout the testing and learning phase  we implemented or tested several merchandising  marketing  and operational strategies to better understand our business future potential 
with certain tactical changes made and the knowledge gained from testing and learning  we are now in the execution phase through 
our long term strategy is based upon results from the first months of the win strategy and encompasses a complete assessment of all areas of our operations in order to identify the key growth initiatives and strategic investments needed to improve the performance of our business 
the execution phase includes a strategic roadmap focused on expanding our operating profit rate  driving sustainable growth in earnings per share  and generating significant cash to reinvest in the business or to return to shareholders 
the following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our win strategy with respect to merchandising  real estate  and operating expenses 
merchandising we developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per square foot and increasing gross margin dollars 
our customer surveys have found that brand name merchandise  the treasure hunt experience  price  value  and savings were most important to our customers 
certain elements of our merchandising strategy were tested and executed in also  in  we refined our detailed merchandising plans in order for each merchant to understand his or her targeted levels of closeout merchandise  engineered closeout merchandise items that we often develop along with our vendors  and product categories that our customers expect us to consistently have in stock 
our objective is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides the greatest value to our customers 
we have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and can collaborate with us to get the desired types and quantities of merchandise to our stores 
during the holiday season  we conducted additional customer surveys and learned the following over of our customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without something specific in mind that they are looking for 
price dominates top of mind awareness and our customers look to us for value and savings 
almost one half of our customers surveyed said their shopping trips last to minutes  which we interpret as they are coming to us to shop the store and for the treasure hunt 
one of the key elements to the success of our merchandising strategy has been the raise the ring strategy 
the raise the ring strategy involves offering a merchandise mix to the customer that includes items with slightly higher average item retail sales price 
one method used to accomplish this is to offer larger package or quantity sizes 
for example  instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis  we may offer the same product in a package of three or six pieces 
another part of the raise the ring strategy involves offering types of merchandise that increase average item retail  based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling  our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us 
based on our customer surveys  we believe our customers want high quality merchandise  which often results in high average item retail 
the raise the ring strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores while positive comparable store sales were achieved 
we expect to drive comparable store sales with both merchandising and marketing 
from a merchandising perspective  we will continue to focus on raising the ring and offering top brand named merchandise 
we expect to offer high quality merchandise at prices that represent good values  even if the sales prices are higher than what has traditionally been found in our stores 
our global sourcing team is expected to be key in improving quality and quantity of our import business in seasonal  furniture and some of the home and hardlines businesses 
we continue to evaluate how our stores are merchandised and  when appropriate  to redesign our stores to focus on capturing volume opportunities in categories that we believe have the potential to out perform other merchandise 
our marketing efforts continue to involve a mix of circulars  in store marketing  television  and online advertising 
many of the products we offer in the circulars are a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above 
the planning and coordination that goes into these circulars improves their effectiveness and helped to drive sales  gross margin dollars  and the inventory turnover rate 
we have developed better in store marketing strategies  such as improved signage  aimed at increasing total sales dollars from each customer 
our new signage was tested favorably during and was rolled out to all stores late in the fourth quarter of lastly  we continue to market to our buzz club  with a free online membership and by aggressively signing up new members and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores 
in  as part of a review of our merchandising strategy  we closed our stand alone furniture stores  executed a series of markdowns lowering in store inventory levels in certain categories and improving inventory turnover  and exited the frozen food business 
real estate as part of our win strategy  we closed stores during  a significant number of which were underperforming 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of of these closed stores were reclassified to discontinued operations in and all prior periods reported 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations 
we have slowed our rate of new store openings and our strategy is more market focused and prioritized to our strongest markets in the northwest  west  and south 
we have allocated approximately million to million in total to open new stores from through this level of expenditure is planned to result in an average of new stores a year 
during  we opened a total of new stores 
while we would like to open more new stores  we continue to exercise prudence with respect to capital allocation  including avoiding overpaying for leased real estate in order to deliver store unit growth 
our strategy includes additional investments in a select number of our existing stores in order to improve operating efficiency 
in  we spent approximately million to implement our new point of sale register system in approximately of our stores 
we expect that our remaining stores will receive the new point of sale register system in at an additional cost of approximately million 
in addition  in  we spent approximately million for store retrofits and merchandise fixtures at approximately of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications 
retrofitting a store includes reorganizing the selling floor primarily by moving fixtures to improve the alignment of the selling floor with our merchandising and marketing efforts 
we believe we have developed a store format that allows us the opportunity to get more merchandise out on the selling floor in some of our higher volume  small square footage stores  including opening full furniture departments in approximately one half of the store retrofits 
in  we plan on completing approximately store retrofits  all of which will add a full furniture department 
operating expenses our goal is to continue to generate selling and administrative expense leverage 
we have changed processes and the way we operate the business 
we believe that changes we have made and continue to make in merchandising are the starting point to achieving our leverage goals 
we have reduced inventory levels at our stores and our regional distribution centers 
we attempt to flow product to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes in a timely manner 
we have increased the percentage of acquired floor ready merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and conveniently packaged for efficient display and sale 
these merchandising efforts and the favorable impact of our raise the ring strategy are expected to help us continue to leverage our store and distribution center operating expenses 
based on these efficiencies along with the new point of sale register system  we continue to evaluate how we schedule payroll hours in our stores as well as the appropriate staffing models 
with respect to distribution and outbound transportation expenses  we believe we have opportunities for further improvement in several areas 
furniture is different than our other merchandise categories because of the bulk of the product and how much can be shipped on a trailer 
historically  furniture has been shipped from different buildings and on different trailers because we did not have the capacity in our regional distribution centers 
in the past  the majority of our stores received weekly shipments from a closeout truck from a regional distribution center and a separate furniture truck from one of our furniture distribution centers on a different day 
this process was not efficient for our stores or distribution centers 
improvements in managing our inventory and turning our goods faster have created capacity in our regional distribution centers 
this allows furniture to be handled through our regional distribution centers and combined with other merchandise which results in fewer shipments and trailers  more efficient unloading processes and less payroll hours needed at the store level 
additionally  we benchmarked all aspects of our transportation in an effort to find new ways to reduce expenses 
as a result  we have improved our processes  including optimizing the timing of deliveries  and we have implemented a vendor compliance program that has generated transportation savings 
we have also reduced our fleet size and changed our mix of carriers 
in certain cases  we have found it to be less expensive overall to use one way carriers where we have historically used round trip carriers 
while our cost per mile has increased  we have significantly reduced the number of miles required to deliver our merchandise 
we have achieved cost savings related to changes to our health care administrator 
in february  we changed our third party network administrator  allowing us to offer our associates a wider network of providers  which in turn allows us to save money 
during this change helped offset medical cost increases and lowered our cost as a percent of sales 
in  our review of our operating expenses resulted in personnel reductions in our general office  field operations  and distribution centers 
certain resources were realigned based on the store closings and further net store closures expected in the near term 
additionally  some redundancies between our closeout store operations and our furniture store operations were eliminated 
discontinued operations we continue to incur exit related costs for some of the stores we closed in that we have classified as discontinued operations  specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain 
we also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the kb toys business in discontinued operations 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations 
compared to net sales net sales decreased to  million in compared to  million in this net sales decrease of million is principally due to sales made during the rd week in and lower store count in  which were partially offset by a comparable store sales increase of 
our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria 
from a merchandise perspective  the consumables  furniture  and seasonal were the best performing categories with comparable store sales increasing in the mid single digits range 
comparable store sales increases in these categories were partially offset by decreases in home and other 
consumables performed consistently throughout the year with positive comparable store sales across all departments 
furniture performed consistently throughout the first three quarters of  however  recent trends in the fourth quarter were more challenging in part because in the fourth quarter we were up against a successful prior year launch of serta mattresses and were transitioning between old and new styles of product in certain key classifications 
seasonal was driven by strength in lawn garden  summer  and christmas  which were partially offset by disappointing halloween and harvest 
home category sales have been very soft since the first quarter s positive performance 
all home departments except for domestics ended the year with negative comparable store sales 
within the other category  the decrease in toy sales and toy comparable store sales was partially offset by the impact from a couple of larger closeout deals  including a drugstore deal and a furniture deal 
similar to other retailers  our toy business was challenged in principally due to the negative publicity from certain high profile toy recalls 
we manage our business based on one segment  broadline closeout retailing 
during the first quarter of  in connection with the completion of the internal re alignment of certain merchandising departments and classes between our divisional merchandising managers  we determined that the following six merchandise categories most directly match our internal management and reporting of merchandise net sales results consumables  home  furniture  hardlines  seasonal  and other 
see item  business of this form k for a more detailed description of each category 
effective for the first quarter of  we use these six categories externally to report net sales information by each merchandise group in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
prior period amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
net sales by product category  net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows change in thousands consumables   home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales    gross margin gross margin dollars decreased to  million in compared to  million in the decline in gross margin by million was principally due to a combination of lower net sales and a lower gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in this gross margin rate decrease of basis points was primarily due to higher markdowns  a shift in the sales mix toward lower margin categories such as consumables  from higher margin categories or departments  such as the home category and the toys department  and higher accruals for shrink 
higher markdowns were attributable in part to slower selling categories and departments  such as the home category and the toys department  and more promotional selling in seasonal and furniture 
the factors decreasing the gross margin rate were partially offset by an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in compared to purchases in this improvement in initial mark up is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as discussed in the above merchandising section under operating strategy 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased to  million in compared to  million in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in in selling and administrative expenses were reduced by million basis points of proceeds from the kb toys bankruptcy trust see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information and million basis points of insurance proceeds as recovery for hurricane insurance claims 
in  selling and administrative expenses included charges of million basis points for the estimated settlement liability for the tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these specific items  the following items contributed to the basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage the increase in comparable store sales  which was above our expense leverage point  a reduction in health and welfare plan expenses of million driven by greater discounts resulting from a change in the plan s service provider effective february  and fewer plan participants  a reduction in distribution and outbound transportation costs of million  and a reduction in store payroll and payroll related expense of million 
distribution and outbound transportation costs  which were included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  decreased to million in compared to million in distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in distribution and outbound transportation cost savings have been achieved through certain management initiatives including  but not limited to  improvements in furniture distribution  more efficient scheduling of labor used in the distribution centers  lower health and welfare plan expense  as discussed above  and transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing the use of our transportation fleet and the increased usage of third party one way carriers 
the higher use of third party one way carriers  which began late in the second quarter of  has increased our cost per mile while decreasing the overall transportation cost as a result of fewer miles traveled 
store payroll continues to benefit from merchandising strategies such as raise the ring  acquiring more floor ready merchandise that has resulted in a reduction in payroll hours required to process fewer cartons  and improved distribution methods 
depreciation expense depreciation expense for was million compared to million for the million decrease was principally related to the decline in capital expenditures over the last months compared to earlier fiscal years 
the lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening seven stores in and stores in compared to opening   and stores in   and  respectively 
in addition  in and  we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system  which was installed in approximately of our stores as of february   and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores 
we expect to complete the installation of the new point of sale register system in all of our remaining stores in in  upon the successful completion of a pilot program in of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores  we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately million of certain point of sale equipment 
the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately million in the fourth quarter of and million in as additional depreciation expense 
the remaining million is expected to be depreciated in interest expense interest expense increased to million in compared to million in the million increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of million in compared to average borrowings of million in the higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of approximately million shares of our common stock for million under our publicly announced share repurchase programs 
interest and investment income interest and investment income increased million in to million compared to million in because we began with cash and cash equivalents of million  we were in an invested position throughout the first half of we invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for the increase in was driven primarily by less benefit from valuation allowance reductions relating to net operating loss deferred tax assets and the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be within a range of to 
the effective income tax rate is planned to be higher as we anticipate less benefit from valuation allowance reductions in  less nontaxable municipal interest income in and higher income from continuing operations 
discontinued operations we recorded income from discontinued operations of million in compared to million in the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the release of our kb bankruptcy lease obligation as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of million  net of tax  the recognition of million of proceeds  net of tax  from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for kb bankruptcy lease obligations and the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by kb toys mortgage guarantee  and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  related to expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the partial release of our kb bankruptcy lease obligation of million  net of tax  and the release of kb toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of million  net of tax  which were partially offset by a loss on the sale of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center of approximately million  net of tax and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  including a million  pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases had not been terminated 
compared to net sales net sales increased to  million in compared to  million in this net sales increase of million was principally due to a increase in comparable store sales and sales made during the rd week in from a merchandise perspective  the consumables  furniture  and hardlines were the best performing categories 
within the consumables category  sales of food and health and beauty products drove the increase which was partially offset by the decline in sales of frozen food  which we discontinued in within the furniture category  sales of upholstery and mattresses drove the increase 
within the hardlines category  sales of electronics drove the increase 
as previously discussed  effective for the first quarter of  we use six categories externally to report net sales information by each merchandise group in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
prior period amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
net sales by product category  net sales by product category as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to  as reclassified  were as follows change in thousands consumables   home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales    gross margin gross margin dollars increased to  million in compared to  million in we achieved our stated goal to increase gross margin dollars as gross margin improved by million principally due to a combination of higher net sales and a slightly higher gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in this gross margin rate increase of basis points was primarily due to an improvement in the initial mark up of merchandise purchased in compared to purchases in this improvement is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as previously discussed 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased to  million in compared to  million in while net sales increased million  selling and administrative expenses increased only million and as a result  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in the following items contributed to the basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage the increase in comparable store sales  which was above our expense leverage point  our raise the ring merchandising strategy which delivered higher sales results with fewer cartons processed by the distribution centers and stores  reduction in general office and field operations headcount primarily due to the elimination of some redundancies between closeout and furniture store operations  and various initiatives aimed at improving efficiency at our stores and distribution centers including tightly managed payroll budgets  the initiation of a vendor compliance program  and merchandising strategies aimed at getting merchandise delivered that is more efficiently able to be displayed on the selling floor  for example  pre ticketed items and improved packaging ready to display packaging  palletized end cap displays  etc some of the increases in selling and administrative expense components from to were bonus expense of million  wage litigation charges of million  utilities of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and asset impairment charges of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in store hourly wages of million  general office wages of million  field operations cost of million  and proceeds received as a result of the visa mastercard antitrust settlement of million 
the bonus expense increase is due primarily to our improved financial performance in and compares to when no general office bonuses were paid 
the wage litigation charges are discussed in more detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
higher utilities costs are primarily a result of higher utility rates 
stock based compensation expense increased primarily as a result of adopting sfas no 
r see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the achievement of a performance based target with respect to nonvested restricted stock awards granted in the first quarter of the asset impairment charges relate primarily to charges taken on certain underperforming stores that were opened in and lower store hourly wages  even with the million increase in sales  are a result of improved productivity in the stores primarily due to lower inventory levels at the stores and our raise the ring merchandising strategy 
the decline in general office and field operations expenses was primarily a result of the reduction in headcount which included the elimination of some redundancies in the furniture and closeout operations 
distribution and outbound transportation costs  which were included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  decreased to million in compared to million in distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in the basis point decrease was primarily due to our raise the ring merchandising strategy which resulted in fewer cartons being processed through the distribution centers with higher carton values 
in addition  our emphasis on improved inventory turnover led to lower inventory levels maintained in the distribution centers 
depreciation expense depreciation expense for was million compared to million for the million decrease was principally related to a declining amount of capital expenditures in and the lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening stores in and a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development of a new point of sale register system and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores in capital expenditures included capital related to the completion of reengineering of our columbus  ohio distribution center 
upon the successful completion of a pilot program in of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores  we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately million of certain point of sale equipment 
the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately million of depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of the estimated remaining service life was based on our projected roll out schedule to all remaining stores  approximately one half in and one half in interest expense interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the million decrease in interest expense was principally due to lower average borrowings of million in compared to average borrowings of million in interest and investment income interest and investment income increased million in to million compared to million in because we generated significant cash flow from our operations  we were in an invested position throughout the majority of we invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for in  we benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of our expectation of utilizing more net operating loss benefits and the resolution of certain income tax matters 
the rate was lower in principally due to proportionately larger jurisdictional losses in entities with higher marginal income tax rates  lower overall income before income taxes  and loss contingency activity partially offset by higher write down of deferred income tax assets as a result of state tax law changes 
discontinued operations we recorded income from discontinued operations of million in compared to loss from discontinued operations of million in the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the partial release of our kb bankruptcy lease obligation as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of million  net of tax  and the release of kb toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of million  net of tax  partially offset by a loss on the sale of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by the kb toys business of approximately million  net of tax and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  including a million  pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
we based the revision of the kb bankruptcy lease obligation on the number of demand notices that we had received from landlords and used information received from kb toys  the bankruptcy trust  and our own lease records which date back to when we owned the kb toys business 
additionally  we released the tax indemnification liabilities in light of information that we received as a result of our settlement discussions with the bankruptcy trustee and kb toys in an attempt to resolve the tax indemnification claims 
our loss from discontinued operations in included million  net of tax  primarily related to exit costs and results of operations of the stores  million  net of tax  of income for the reversal of liabilities associated with the kb toys business  and million  net of tax  associated with the write down of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center to fair value less selling cost  upon its classification as held for sale 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources on october   we entered into the million credit agreement 
the credit agreement is scheduled to terminate on october  the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  working capital  and to repay certain of our indebtedness 
the pricing and fees related to the credit agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating 
loans made under the credit agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement  which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit  and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
on december   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement in order to permit us to acquire investments rated by an additional rating agency 
on october   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement in order to eliminate the impact on the covenant calculations of the charges related to the store closings discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our amended financial covenants under the credit agreement at february  the credit agreement permits  at our option  borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or the london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin 
the credit agreement also permits  as applicable  borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders 
whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the credit agreement  we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis 
the daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position  which is generally driven by cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise and payroll  wire and other electronic transactions  and other miscellaneous disbursements 
in addition to revolving credit loans  the credit agreement includes a million swing loan sub limit  a million bid loan sub limit  and a million letter of credit sub limit 
at february   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was as of february  at february   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
the borrowings available under the credit agreement  after taking into account the outstanding borrowings and the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million  were million at february  we utilize our credit facility  as necessary  to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchase programs  and other expenditures 
in addition  our credit facility is used to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements  a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs 
given the seasonality of our business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including our operating financial performance  the time of year  and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season 
we anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than million through the end of may liquidity the primary source of our liquidity is cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
at february   working capital was million 
we generated million from operating activities in  driven by net income of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  improved accounts payable leverage of million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
these increases in cash were partially offset by a decline in accrued operating expenses of million 
the increase in accounts payable was driven by our efforts to improve terms with our vendors 
at february   to minimize the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement  the dollar amount of outstanding checks was greater than cash deposited at our disbursement bank  and as a result  we reported the unfunded checks as accounts payable 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower store count at the end of the the decline in accrued operating expenses included lower insurance reserves  primarily due to the new health and welfare plan provider in that makes claim payments in a more timely manner  lower accrued bonus primarily due to the lower rate of achievement of general office and store performance objectives in  and lower sales taxes payable primarily driven by the rd week in fiscal cash provided by operating activities was million during and resulted primarily from net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a reduction in inventories of million  timing associated with current income taxes of million  and improved accounts payable leverage of million 
lower inventories were principally due to our continued efforts to improve the inventory turnover rate and to keep store merchandise fresh 
our income tax position was favorable because we received income tax refunds in related primarily to the overpayment of taxes in and had income taxes payable of approximately million at the end of we improved our accounts payable leverage principally by extending payment terms to foreign vendors 
cash used in investing activities was million in and million in and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures of million in and million in capital expenditures in were principally costs related to the installation of the new point of sale register system in approximately of our stores  costs for approximately store retrofits to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications  and seven new store openings 
capital expenditures in were primarily related to opening new stores  software development cost for our new point of sale system  and various distribution center  store  or lease related requirements 
capital expenditure requirements in are anticipated to range between million and million  focused on completing the installation of the new point of sale register system in our stores  development and licensing cost associated with our sap for retail system implementation  the completion of approximately additional store retrofits  approximately new store openings  and other projects aimed at maintaining existing property and equipment 
cash used in financing activities was million in driven by million of share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase programs  which were partially offset by million of borrowings under the credit agreement  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and million for the excess tax benefit derived from share based awards 
cash used in financing activities was million in and consisted primarily of share repurchases under the million share repurchase program  which were partially offset by million of stock option exercise proceeds  million of proceeds from selling one of our owned store properties  and million for the excess tax benefit derived from the exercise of stock options by employees 
see item of this form k for more information regarding our share repurchase programs 
we continue to believe that we have  or  if necessary  have the ability to obtain adequate resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures 
additionally  management is not aware of any current trends  events  demands  commitments  or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at february  payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations     capital lease obligations   purchase obligations      other long term liabilities      total contractual obligations   the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges  or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under  or the automatic renewal of  contracts that provide for the same 
long term debt obligations consist of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at february  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from this table 
the remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in purchase obligations 
for a further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for retail stores  warehouse space  offices  and certain computer and other business equipment 
the future minimum commitments for store and warehouse space operating leases are million 
for a discussion of leases  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of common area maintenance costs cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
in connection with our store lease obligations  we estimated that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance were million at february  we have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to use of historical data to estimate our future obligations  calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for a particular leasehold  and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data 
the remaining lease obligation of million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment 
for purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  we disclosed our minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of february  in addition  we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at february  while we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods  as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation  information technology  print advertising  and other store security  supply  and maintenance commitments 
other long term liabilities include million for expected pension plan contributions  our million obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for closed store lease termination costs 
pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans 
we have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions 
we have included unrecognized tax benefits of million for payments expected in and million of fin no 
timing related items anticipated to reverse in unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to kb toys 
for further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february   we have kb lease obligations  as that term is defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  with respect to approximately open kb toys stores 
in  we entered into an agreement with kb toys and various prentice capital entities owners affiliates of kb toys which we believe provides for a cap of our liability under the existing kb toys guaranteed store leases and an indemnification from the prentice capital entities with respect to any renewals  extensions  modifications  or amendments of these guaranteed leases which could potentially add incremental liability to us beyond the date of the agreement  which was september  under these agreements  kb toys is required to update us periodically with respect to the status of any remaining leases which they believe we have guaranteed 
in addition  we have the right to request the net asset value of prentice capital offshore in order to monitor the sufficiency of their indemnification 
because these remaining guarantees were issued prior to january   they are not subject to the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
however  we will recognize a liability if a loss in connection with any of the kb lease obligations becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of kb toys matters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  judgments  and assumptions  including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates  judgments  and assumptions on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates  judgments  and assumptions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and management believes the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to the accurate reporting of our results of operations and financial position 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period 
under the average cost retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail selling values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on each department s average cost to retail ratio for beginning inventory and for current fiscal year purchase activity 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  the estimated allowance for shrinkage  and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin 
these estimates are based on historical experience and current information 
cost reductions in inventory valuation as a result of permanent sales markdowns  which are typically related to end of season clearance events  are recorded as a charge to cost of sales in the period of management s decision to initiate sales price reductions with the intent not to return the price to regular retail 
promotional markdowns are typically related to specific marketing efforts with respect to products maintained continuously in our stores or products that are only available in limited quantities but represent substantial value to our customers 
promotional markdowns are principally used to drive higher sales volume during a defined promotional period  and were recorded as a charge to net sales in the period the merchandise is sold 
factors considered in the estimate of the reduction to cost of inventory for permanent markdowns at the end of each reporting period include current and anticipated demand for the merchandise  customer preferences  quantity of merchandise  age of the merchandise  and seasonal trends such as customer buying patterns  competitive pressures  weather  and the desire to keep merchandise in the stores fresh and inventory turning 
the inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories and charged to cost of sales and is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on our historical experience and current year experience based on a sample of recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage 
the inventory allowance for excess or obsolete inventory is estimated based on a review of our aged inventory and takes into account any items that have already received a cost reduction as a result of the permanent markdown process discussed above 
we estimate an allowance for excess or obsolete inventory based on historical sales trends  age and quantity of product on hand  and anticipated future sales 
if any of the estimates  judgments  or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory are incorrect  the actual inventory value on our consolidated balance sheet and the gross margin on our consolidated statement of operations could materially differ from the reported results 
long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment 
in order to determine if impairment indicators are present on store property and equipment  we review historical operating results at the store level 
generally  all other property and equipment are reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level 
impairment is recorded if impairment indicators are present and if the carrying values of the long lived assets exceeded their anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows 
our assumptions related to estimates of future cash flows are based on historical results of cash flows adjusted for management projections for future periods 
we estimated the fair value of our long lived assets using readily available market information for similar assets 
when material  we classify the results of operations of closed stores to discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the stores have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations and we no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the operations associated with the stores after closure 
we generally meet the second criteria on all closed stores as  upon closure  operations ceased and we have no continuing involvement 
to determine if cash flows have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations  we evaluate a number of qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to  proximity to remaining open stores and estimated sales migration from the closed store to any stores remaining open 
estimated sales migration is based on our historical experiences of our sales migration upon opening or closing a store in a similar market 
for purposes of reporting the operations of stores meeting the criteria for discontinued operations  we reported net sales  gross margin  and related operating costs that are directly related to and specifically identifiable with respect to those stores operations as discontinued operations 
certain corporate level charges  such as general office cost  field operations  national advertising  fixed distribution costs  and interest cost are not allocated to discontinued operations because we believe that these costs are not specific to the stores operations 
share based compensation we adopted the fair value recognition provisions for stock options of sfas no 
r  accounting for share based compensation  on january   under the modified prospective method  in which the requirements of sfas no 
r are to be applied to new awards and to previously granted awards that were not fully vested on the effective date 
the modified prospective method does not require restatement of previous years financial statements 
we used the short cut method to determine our beginning excess tax benefit pool 
upon adoption  the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
we value and expense stock options with graded vesting as a single award with an average estimated life over the entire term of the award 
the expense for options with graded vesting is recorded straight line over the vesting period 
the fair value of nonvested restricted stock awards is measured at the grant date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
compensation expense for all share based awards is recognized in selling and administrative expense 
we use a binomial model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted on or after february  the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield rate  risk free rate  contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
expected volatility is based in part on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury security yields at the time of the grant 
the dividend yield on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so 
the expected life is determined from the binomial model 
the model incorporates exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data 
compensation expense for performance based nonvested restricted stock awards is recorded based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria 
an estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures 
we monitor the projected achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make prospective adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we assess the adequacy and need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
we establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year  subsequent recognition  de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit in accordance with fin no

in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 which became effective at the beginning of fin no 
is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin no 
requires us to recognize in our financial statements the impact of an income tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained  based on the technical merits of the position 
the recognition and measurement guidelines of fin no 
were applied to all of our material income tax positions as of the beginning of  resulting in an increase in our tax liabilities of million with a corresponding decrease to beginning retained earnings for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  unrecognized tax benefits  and the related accruals and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
pension actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plans 
inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
we review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  we review rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations  and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plan s asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate of return 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for is 
a decrease in the discount rates would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in is 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
insurance and insurance related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is funded by employees 
we purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity 
management makes estimates  judgments  and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations  including but not limited to  estimated health care cost trends  estimated lag time to report and pay claims  average cost per claim  network utilization rates  network discount rates  and other factors 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  using a discount rate  while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
to the extent that actual claim costs vary from the estimates we have recorded and reflected in our consolidated financial statements  future earnings could be materially impacted 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies including legal actions  lease termination obligations on closed stores  lease indemnification obligations on kb toys stores  and other claims arising out of the normal course of our business 
in connection with such claims and contingencies  we estimate the likelihood and amounts  where possible to do so  of any potential obligation using management s judgment 
management uses various internal and external specialists to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of the various claims and contingencies could be materially different from management s estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
with respect to the lease termination obligations and lease indemnification obligations  we consider the remaining minimum lease payments  estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained  and other potentially mitigating factors 
as market conditions or other factors change  the estimate of the obligations could be materially different 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our recorded obligations for claims and contingences based on current information  including settlement amounts of individual lease obligations compared to recorded contractual obligations 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable  or  if it is probable but an estimate is not determinable  disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  because it is not permissible to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
revenue recognition we recognize sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
sales are recorded net of discounts and estimated returns and excludes any sales tax 
the reserve for merchandise returns is estimated based on our prior return experience 
we sell gift cards to our customers in our retail stores 
we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift card balances and our gift cards do not expire 
we recognize sales revenue from gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer  or the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote gift card breakage and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions 
we determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns 
gift card breakage income of million is included in the net sales on our consolidated statements of operations 
the liability for the unredeemed cash value of gift cards is recorded in accrued operating expenses 
we offer price hold contracts on selected furniture merchandise 
revenue for price hold contracts is recognized when the customer makes the final payment and takes possession of the merchandise 
amounts paid by customers under price hold contracts are recorded in accrued operating expenses until a sale is consummated 
lease accounting rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease 
we recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord  which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening 
when a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent  we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis and record the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred incentive rent 
we also receive tenant allowances  which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
in order to properly recognize rent expense on our leases  we must properly identify the lease term 
the lease term is the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property 
our leases generally have renewal options that extend beyond the original minimum lease period  however  these lease option periods are ignored for the purpose of calculating straight line rent or amortizing any deferred rent 
from time to time we modify lease terms with existing or new landlords  including but not limited to  modifications due to a change in ownership of the property  modifications requiring us to change locations within a shopping center  early terminations  and other modifications 
in these cases  we assess whether a significant modification has occurred and if so  determine the appropriate accounting for the applicable components of deferred rent associated with that lease 
our leases generally obligate us for our applicable portion of real estate taxes  cam  and property insurance that has been incurred by the landlord with respect to the leased property 
we maintain accruals for our estimated applicable portion of real estate taxes  cam  and property insurance incurred but not settled at each reporting date 
we estimate these accruals based on historical payments made and take into account any known trends 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that actual costs incurred by landlords and the resulting payments by us may be higher or lower than the amounts we have recorded on our books 
certain of our leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at the lease inception date 
contingent rent includes rent based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level 
contingent rent is excluded from minimum rent and is included in the determination of total rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable
