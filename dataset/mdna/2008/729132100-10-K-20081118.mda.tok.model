the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and risk factors included in item a herein 
executive summary fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  over fiscal year to  million 
our sector focused business development strategy delivered growth in all five of our end market sectors 
net sales in the defense security aerospace sector exhibited the highest percentage growth due to new program wins and strong end market demand from the top three customers in this sector and strong demand from our largest defense customer in the first half of fiscal however  net sales to this customer decreased significantly in the second half of fiscal  from million in the first half of the year to million in the second half 
net sales in our wireline networking sector also increased due to increased demand from several customers  including juniper networks  inc juniper  our largest customer 
gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared favorably to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal benefited from the operating leverage gained on increased revenues while moderating the increase in fixed manufacturing costs  favorable changes in the customer and sector mix and further operational efficiencies 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or percent  from the million for fiscal the current year period had increased variable incentive compensation of million over the prior year period  as well as increased stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition  salaries and benefits increased  reflecting wage increases and additional headcount 
net income for fiscal was million and diluted earnings per share were  which compared favorably to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal fiscal was favorably impacted by an percent effective tax rate  a decrease from the percent effective tax rate in fiscal fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
net sales in our wireline networking sector in fiscal were positively impacted by increased demand from several customers  including juniper 
our wireless infrastructure sector experienced flat revenues  while our remaining sectors were impacted unfavorably by reduced demand from several customers 
net sales in the defense security aerospace sector experienced episodic demand from our largest defense sector customer during fiscal gross margin was percent for fiscal  which compared unfavorably to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by increased fixed manufacturing costs to support growth in asia  lower pricing  changes in customer mix and the write down of inventory 
selling and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million or percent over fiscal the increase was attributable to additional headcount and associated salaries and expenses to augment business development as well as increased stock based compensation expense  partially offset by less variable incentive compensation 
net income for fiscal was million  and diluted earnings per share were  which compared unfavorably to net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal fiscal included a favorable adjustment of million to the tax provision for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets in the united states  whereas fiscal was unfavorably impacted by a percent effective tax rate 
other 
the effective income tax rates for fiscal  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and china  where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays which extend through and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased in fiscal from fiscal because we recorded a tax provision associated with us pre tax income in fiscal whereas no such tax provision was required for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we recorded minimal income tax expense as a result of the establishment in fiscal of a full valuation allowance on us deferred income tax assets and increased income in malaysia and china  which benefit from tax holidays  and reduced pre tax income in the united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the previously recorded valuation allowance as a credit to income tax 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately percent due to the mix of pre tax income expected to occur in each tax jurisdiction 
due to significant tax rate differences in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our effective tax rate can change significantly as the relative amount of income earned in these jurisdictions changes 
china and mexico passed new tax laws that were effective on january  those new laws may result in higher tax rates on our operations in those countries in fiscal and beyond 
roic 
one of our metrics for measuring financial performance is after tax roic  which in fiscal exceeded our estimated percent wacc 
we define after tax roic as tax effected operating income  excluding unusual charges  divided by average capital employed over a rolling five quarter period 
capital employed is defined as equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
roic was percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 
see the table below for our calculation of roic dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  september  operating income tax effected  excluding unusual charges average capital employed after tax roic for a reconciliation of roic to our financial statements that were prepared using generally accepted accounting priciples gaap  see exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal outlook 
our financial goals for fiscal are to build on the prior year s achievements and to focus on attaining organic net sales growth and further improvements in operating income while maintaining our roic above our estimated wacc 
over the past several years  we have consistently set our target annual revenue growth range at percent to percent 
however  given the current macroeconomic environment and our uncertainty in longer range customer forecasts  we are refraining from providing full year fiscal revenue targets until forecasts begin to stabilize and visibility improves 
we currently expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million  however  our results will ultimately depend upon the actual level of customer orders  which could vary 
assuming that net sales are in the range noted above  we would currently expect to earn  before any restructuring and impairment costs  between to per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal see risk factors  in item a hereof  which sets forth some of the other factors which could effect our net sales  operations and earnings going forward 
reportable segments a further discussion of our fiscal and financial performance by reportable segment is presented below dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  september  net sales united states asia mexico europe elimination of inter segment sales operating income loss united states asia mexico europe corporate and other costs united states net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
this growth reflected higher demand from an unnamed defense security aerospace customer  a wireless infrastructure customer and several wireline networking customers  including juniper 
operating income for fiscal improved million from fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales and favorable changes in customer mix  offset by bad debt expense of approximately million related to a customer that filed chapter bankruptcy during the year 
in addition  operating income in the prior year period was negatively impacted by a million write down of inventories 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to  million 
this growth reflected increased sales to several customers within the wireline networking sector  including juniper 
operating income for fiscal declined million from fiscal  due to an unfavorable customer mix  lower pricing  a million warranty related charge and a million write down of inventories in the second quarter of fiscal due to financial concerns about a customer 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we partially offset the inventory write down discussed above due to recognition of million of revenue associated with the cash collection and subsequent shipments of this customer s inventory  which resulted in a pre tax net impact recovery of million 
asia net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
this growth reflected increased net sales to several customers  with the most significant customer growth coming from a customer in the medical sector  two customers in the wireline networking sector and a customer in the industrial commercial sector 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income improved primarily as a result of higher net sales and operating efficiencies resulting from higher production levels 
increased operating income was partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs associated with the expansion of facilities and related production equipment  as well as additional selling and administrative costs incurred to support growth 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
this growth reflected increased demand from wireline networking  wireless infrastructure and medical customers as well as the transfer of a medical program from the united states 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal earnings benefited from the incremental net sales and the operating efficiencies from the higher production levels 
the increase in operating income was moderated by the increased fixed manufacturing costs associated with the expansion of facilities as well as additional selling and administrative costs incurred to support the revenue growth 
mexico net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
the net sales increase was primarily driven by increased demand from an industrial commercial customer as well as a new wireline networking customer  offset by decreased demand from two medical customers 
operating loss improved million from the prior year period to a loss of million 
the significant improvement from fiscal resulted from a concentrated effort to improve operating results and profitability 
this included the replacement of certain key members of the leadership team  headcount reductions to better align the cost structure to revenue and assistance from other plexus resources as needed 
in addition  fiscal results benefited from approximately million of revenue from shipping previously written down inventories and the ramping up of production for several new customers of the site 
net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the decline in net sales was related to a wireless infrastructure customer going end of life as well as reduced demand from an industrial customer that disengaged 
operating losses widened to million as a result of the reduction in net sales and the write down of million of inventory for customers going end of life 
europe net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  over fiscal to million 
the change in net sales can be attributed to increased demand from two customers offsetting the loss of three customer programs that went end of life 
operating income improved million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of favorable changes in customer mix and the recognition of million of revenue related to the shipment of previously written down inventories 
net sales in fiscal declined by million  or percent  from fiscal  to million 
the revenue decline was attributable to three programs going end of life 
operating income increased million or percent  to million for fiscal due to the reduced fixed manufacturing and administrative costs associated with the closure of the maldon facility in the second quarter of fiscal as well as the recognition of million of revenue related to the cash collection and subsequent shipment of previously written down inventory for a financially distressed customer in fiscal for our significant customers  we generally manufacture products in more than one location 
net sales to juniper  our largest customer  occur in the united states and asia 
net sales to ge  another significant customer  occur in the united states  asia  mexico and europe 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments  including a detail of net sales by reportable segment 
facility closures expansions in early fiscal  we purchased a second manufacturing facility in appleton  wisconsin 
the new facility provides an additional  square feet of manufacturing space 
we expect to begin manufacturing in this facility in the first half of fiscal see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this subsequent event 
in fiscal  we announced our intention to close our ayer manufacturing facility and transition the customer programs to other facilities in our organization 
the decision was the result of our proactive strategic planning process 
after this analysis we determined that the ayer facility was not strategically aligned with our future growth prospects and we could provide greater value to its customers by providing services at other plexus locations 
the closure of the facility is expected by march in fiscal  we announced the addition of a new facility in hangzhou  china 
the leased facility is expected to require an investment of approximately million for the leasehold and building improvements 
the new facility will provide approximately  square feet of manufacturing space 
we expect to begin manufacturing in the new facility during the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we announced our intention to close the maldon manufacturing facility and transition the customer programs to our kelso manufacturing facility 
the decision was the result of reduced customer demand in the united kingdom 
the maldon facility was closed in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we announced the purchase of a third manufacturing and engineering facility in penang  malaysia penang 
the new facility provides an additional  square feet of manufacturing space 
the initial investment for the facility of approximately million was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  we began manufacturing in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we also announced the expansion of our manufacturing facility in xiamen  china by approximately  square feet 
this increased our manufacturing capacity at this facility to  square feet 
we began manufacturing in the additional space during the second quarter of fiscal results of operations net sales 
net sales for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  september  increase decrease decrease net sales net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal the net sales growth was due to increased demand from customers in each of our five end market sectors 
significant increases were noted in our wireline networking  defense security aerospace and industrial commercial sectors 
increases in the wireline networking sector included increases with our largest customer  juniper 
net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal the net sales growth reflected increased demand from several customers within the wireline networking sector  including juniper  our largest customer 
reduced demand from customers within the medical  the industrial commercial and the defense security aerospace sectors moderated the overall increase in fiscal net sales 
our net sales percentages by market sector for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  september  september  wireline networking wireless infrastructure medical industrial commercial defense security aerospace the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal years ended september  september  september  juniper ge top customers represents less than percent of net sales net sales to our customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements  terminations  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued net sales to our significant customers  and our customer concentration has remained at or above percent during the year 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customers forecasts can and do change as a result of changes in their end market demand and other factors 
any material change in forecasts or orders from these major accounts  or other customers  could materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors  we become increasingly dependent upon economic and business conditions affecting that sector 
gross profit 
gross profit and gross margin for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  september  increase decrease decrease gross profit gross margin for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors increased net sales in all four us  asian  mexican and european reportable segments favorable changes in customer mix  including an increase in sales during the first half of fiscal to the large unnamed defense customer  which helped to improve operating efficiencies a moderate increase in fixed manufacturing costs in the us and asian reportable segments primarily due to higher salaries and benefits  as a result of additional employees to support net sales growth  and increased variable incentive compensation an increase in depreciation expense and other fixed manufacturing expenses as a result of our expanded facilities in penang being operational for an entire fiscal year and recognition of million of net sales in the european and mexican reportable segments associated with shipments of previously written down inventories 
for fiscal  gross profit and gross margin were impacted by the following factors the inventory write downs of million in the us and mexican reportable segments recognition of million of revenue associated with the cash collection and subsequent shipments of previously written down inventory for two financially distressed customers in the us and european reportable segments million of warranty related expense in the us reportable segment an increase in fixed manufacturing costs as a result of our expansion in penang and reduced net sales in the european and mexican reportable segments  changes in customer mix  price reductions and increased depreciation expense  all of which unfavorably impacted gross margin 
gross margin reflects a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product and service mix  the level of new facility start up costs  inefficiencies resulting from the transition of new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price reductions  overall capacity utilization  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
additionally  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margin and net sales 
although we focus on maintaining gross margin  there can be no assurance that gross margin will not decrease in future periods 
design work performed by us is not our proprietary property and all costs incurred with this work are generally considered reimbursable by our customers 
we do not track research and development costs that are not reimbursed by our customers and we consider these amounts immaterial 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  september  increase decrease decrease s a percent of net sales the dollar increase in s a for fiscal was due to increased salaries and benefits  reflecting wage increases  additional headcount to augment business development activities and additional expense for variable incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense 
variable incentive compensation increased million over the prior year period as a result of strong financial performance compared to incentive plan targets 
the dollar increase in s a for fiscal was related to several factors that impacted compensation expense 
we added additional headcount to augment business development activities 
in addition  we were impacted by wage increases as well as incremental stock based compensation of million in fiscal offsetting these increases was variable incentive compensation  which decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in s a as a percent of net sales was due to a percent increase in net sales in fiscal over fiscal restructuring and impairment costs 
our restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  september  asset impairments severance costs adjustments to lease exit costs other total restructuring and impairment costs the restructuring and impairment costs were associated with various reportable segments 
such costs were not allocated to our reportable segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the reportable segments 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for certain financial information regarding our reportable segments  including a summary of restructuring and impairment costs by reportable segment

fiscal restructuring and asset impairment costs for fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and asset impairment costs of million  related to the decisions to initially convert and then ultimately close our maldon facility and to reduce the workforce in juarez 
for fiscal  these restructuring costs were offset by favorable adjustments in lease obligations of million  as a result of entering into lease termination or sublease agreements for three of our previously closed facilities in the bothell and seattle  washington area  as well as favorable adjustments of million  related to other restructuring accruals 
the details of these fiscal restructuring actions are listed below maldon facility closure we announced the decision to close our maldon facility in july for fiscal  we recorded million for severance and asset impairments related to the closure of the maldon facility

this restructuring affected employees 
other restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of million related to severance at our juarez facility

other income expense 
other income expense for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended variance fiscal years ended variance september  september  increase september  september  increase decrease decrease other income expense percent of net sales other income expense for fiscal decreased million  to million of expense from million of income in fiscal this was due to increased interest expense of million  primarily related to servicing the million term loan drawn in april  and reduced interest income of million  which was due to reduced effective interest rates and lower average cash balances during fiscal miscellaneous income expense fluctuated unfavorably due primarily to foreign currency translation adjustments 
other income expense for fiscal increased million  to million of income  over fiscal due to increased interest income related to higher average cash balances as well as a higher effective interest rate during fiscal interest expense remained comparable between fiscal years 
miscellaneous income expense fluctuated unfavorably due primarily to foreign currency translation adjustments 
income taxes 
income taxes for the indicated periods were as follows dollars in millions fiscal years ended september  september  september  income tax expense benefit effective annual tax rate the decrease in our effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a higher proportion of income in malaysia and china where we currently have reduced tax rates due to tax holidays that extend through and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased in fiscal from fiscal because we recorded a tax provision associated with us pre tax income in fiscal whereas no such tax provision was required for the prior fiscal years 
during fiscal  we recorded minimal income tax expense as a result of the establishment in fiscal of a full valuation allowance on us deferred income tax assets see further discussion below and increased income in malaysia and china  which benefit from tax holidays  and reduced pre tax income in the united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the previously recorded valuation allowance as a credit to income tax 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 historical and projected financial results along with any other positive or negative evidence should be considered when assessing our ability to generate future taxable income and realize any net deferred income tax assets 
our us operations generated significant pre tax income in fiscal based on our fiscal pre tax income and an assessment of expected future profitability in the us  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits of our cumulative net deferred income tax assets in the us would be utilized in the future 
therefore  we reversed million of the valuation allowance as noted above 
as a result of using the with and without method under sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  we recorded a valuation allowance against the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to tax deductions in excess of compensation expense for stock options until such time as the related deductions actually reduce income taxes payable 
we had recorded a valuation allowance of million in fiscal against our net operating loss carryforwards as of september  during fiscal  we realized a reduction of our income taxes payable for all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and a portion of our state net operating loss carryforwards 
consequently  we reversed approximately million of this valuation allowance with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
during fiscal  we released an additional million to additional paid in capital due to the usage of our state net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we had a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of september  in addition  there was a remaining valuation allowance of million as of september   related to various state deferred income tax assets for which utilization was uncertain due to a lack of sustained profitability and limited carryforward periods in those states 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately percent 
china and mexico have passed new tax laws that were effective on january  those new laws may result in higher tax rates on our operations in those countries during fiscal or in the future 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  our net income increased by million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal diluted earnings per share increased percent 
the per share earnings increased at a higher rate than net income due to the effects of our stock repurchase program  which was conducted during fiscal net income decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal compared to fiscal  diluted earnings per share decreased percent 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily provided by earnings after adjusting for the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization expense  deferred income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
these positive cash flow effects were offset  in part  by higher accounts receivable and inventory to support increased customer demand in the first quarter of fiscal our annualized days sales outstanding in accounts receivable for fiscal decreased from days in fiscal to days in fiscal  primarily as a result of stronger cash collections 
our inventory turns decreased from turns for fiscal to turns for fiscal inventories increased by million from september   primarily as a result of increased finished goods to enhance flexibility and support inventory models such as dof for various customers 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal the primary investments included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by million of net sales of short term securities 
fiscal purchases of property  plant and equipment included million  million  million and million related to our asian  us  mexican and european reportable segments  respectively 
we utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the principal sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal our actual level of capital expenditures for fiscal will depend on anticipated demand  but we currently expect to spend in the range of million to million 
cash flows utilized by financing activities  totaling million for fiscal  primarily represent the purchases of common stock related to our share repurchase program  offset by proceeds from the issuance of a million term loan in april on february   plexus adopted a common stock buyback program that permitted it to acquire shares of its common stock for an amount up to million 
the authorized stock repurchase program consisted of a million accelerated stock repurchase asr program and an additional million of open market purchases 
during the second quarter of fiscal  under our asr plan  we purchased a total of million shares classified as treasury stock at a volume weighted average price of per share 
in addition to the asr plan purchases  the company repurchased million shares at a volume weighted average price of per share in the open market during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of therefore  the company completed the million share repurchase program with a total purchase of million shares at a volume weighted average price of per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our share repurchase program 
on april   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit facility with a group of banks which allows us to borrow million in term loans and million in revolving loans 
the million in term loans was immediately funded and the million revolving credit facility is currently available 
the amended credit facility is unsecured and may be increased by an additional million the accordion feature if we have not previously terminated all or any portion of the amended credit facility  there is no event of default existing under the credit agreement and both we and the administrative agent consent to the increase 
the amended credit facility expires on april  borrowings under the amended credit facility may be either through term loans or revolving or swing loans or letter of credit obligations 
as of november   we have term loan borrowings of million outstanding and no revolving borrowings under the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility amended and restated our prior revolving credit facility revolving credit facility with a group of banks that allowed us to borrow up to million of which million was committed 
the revolving credit facility was due to expire on january  and was also unsecured 
it also contained other terms and financial conditions  which were substantially similar to those under the amended credit facility 
the amended credit facility contains certain financial covenants  which include a maximum total leverage ratio  maximum value of fixed rentals and operating lease obligations  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a minimum net worth test  all as defined in the agreement 
as of september   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
if we incur an event of default  as defined in the amended credit facility including any failure to comply with a financial covenant  the group of banks has the right to terminate the remaining revolving credit facility and all other obligations  and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding sums principal and accrued interest 
interest on borrowing varies depending upon our then current total leverage ratio  as of september   the company could elect to pay interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus 
rates would increase upon negative changes in specified company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio to no less than libor plus 
we are also required to pay an annual commitment fee on the unused credit commitment based on our leverage ratio  the current fee is percent 
unless the accordion feature is exercised  this fee applies only to the initial million of availability excluding the million of term borrowings 
origination fees and expenses associated with the amended credit facility totaled approximately million and have been deferred 
these origination fees and expenses will be amortized over the five year term of the amended credit facility 
quarterly principal repayments on the term loan of million each began june   and end on april   with a final balloon repayment of million 
the amended credit facility allows for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default including any failure to comply with a financial covenant is existing at the time of  or would be caused by  the dividend payment or the share repurchases 
as of september   we held million of auction rate securities  which were classified as long term investments and whose underlying assets were in guaranteed student loans backed by a u 
s 
government agency 
auction rate securities are adjustable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset every to days through an auction process  with underlying securities that have original contractual maturities greater than years 
auctions for these investments failed during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and there is no assurance that future auctions on these securities will succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our adjustable rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
these developments have resulted in the classification of these securities as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements 
if the issuers of these adjustable rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit quality deteriorates  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value 
based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and short term investments  the amended credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements through fiscal although net sales growth anticipated for fiscal is expected to increase our working capital needs  we currently do not anticipate having to use our amended credit facility to finance this growth 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources 
however  particularly due to the current instability of the credit and financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms 
we anticipate using our earnings to support the future growth of our business 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future 
we may in the future consider repurchasing some of our outstanding shares  although at this time no board authorization is in place for additional purchases 
the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchase of shares would be dependent upon being compliant with the financial covenants existing under the amended credit facility 
these covenants require that there be no event of default existing at the time of  or be caused by  a dividend payment or share repurchase 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  dollars in millions payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities on the balance sheet other long term liabilities not on the balance sheet total contractual cash obligations as of april   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement and immediately funded a term loan for million

see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of september   purchase obligations consisted of purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   other long term obligations on the balance sheet included deferred compensation obligations to certain of our former and current executive officers and other key employees  and an asset retirement obligation related to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
we have excluded from the above table the impact of approximately million related to unrecognized income tax benefits as of september   due to the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation 
as of september   other long term obligations not on the balance sheet consisted of a commitment for salary continuation in the event employment of one executive officer of the company is terminated without cause 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  other off balance sheet arrangements or other commercial commitments that were material 
disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  there were no material changes to these policies 
our more critical accounting policies are noted below stock based compensation effective october   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
upon adoption  we transitioned to sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the first period that sfas no 
r is effective and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
prior periods stock based compensation expense is still presented on a pro forma basis 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings 
intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective october   we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but instead we test those assets for impairment  at least annually  and recognize any related losses when incurred 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment has occurred 
we measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the reporting unit s estimated fair market value  which is primarily estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows  although market valuations may also be employed 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or customers and unforeseen reductions in customer demand  future operating performance or industry demand 
revenue net sales from manufacturing services are recognized when the product has been shipped  the risk of ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
this point depends on contractual terms and generally occurs upon shipment of the goods from plexus 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
net sales from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less duration  are recognized as costs are incurred utilizing a percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical rates of returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  the company designates the derivative as a hedge of a recognized asset or liability a fair value hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualify as a fair value hedge are recorded in earnings along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
changes in the fair value of a derivative used to hedge the net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income accounts within shareholders equity 
in june  the company entered into three interest rate swap contracts related to the million in term loans under the amended credit facility that have a total notional value of million and mature on april  these interest rate swap contracts will pay the company variable interest at the three month libor rate  and the company will pay the counterparties a fixed interest rate 
the fixed interest rates for each of these contracts are  and  respectively 
these interest rate swap contracts were entered into to convert million of the variable rate term loan under the amended credit facility into fixed rate debt 
based on the terms of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying debt  these interest rate contracts were determined to be effective  and thus qualify as a cash flow hedge 
as such  any changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows 
any gain or loss on the derivatives will be recorded in the income statement in interest expense 
the total fair value of these interest rate swap contracts is million at september   and the company has recorded this amount in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
although our net deferred income tax assets as of september  still reflect a million valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets  we may be able to utilize these deferred income tax assets to offset future taxable income in certain states 
we also have a remaining valuation allowance of million related to tax deductions associated with stock based compensation as of september  new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have used foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
as of september   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the indicated periods were as follows fiscal year net sales total costs interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for million in term loans as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our amended credit facility under which we borrowed million on april  through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we have fixed the basis on which we pay interest  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk 
a percent change in the weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had only a nominal impact on net interest expense 
auction rate securities as of september   we held million of auction rate securities  which were classified as long term other assets 
on february   we were unable to liquidate these investments  whose underlying assets were in guaranteed student loans backed by a us government agency 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a successful auction occurs and these securities are liquidated at par value 
at this time  we believe that the securities will eventually be recovered 
however  we may be required to hold these securities until market stability is restored for these instruments or final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded value 
accordingly  we have classified these securities as long term other assets
