item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
design build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery 
unlike traditional projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction  design build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both design and construction 
revenue from design build projects represented and of granite east revenue in and  respectively 
revenue from design build projects represented and of granite west revenue in and  respectively 
although these projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid build projects  the profit potential can also be higher 
we frequently bid design build projects as a part of a joint venture team 
granite land company we purchase  develop  operate  sell and otherwise invest in real estate through our granite land company subsidiary glc  which also provides real estate services for other granite operations 
glc s portfolio of projects includes both commercial and residential development and is geographically diversified throughout the west and texas 
in  revenue from glc was million of our total revenue  compared with million of our total revenue in additional information about our business segments is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business strategy our fundamental objective is to increase long term shareholder value by focusing on consistent profitability from controlled revenue growth 
shareholder value is measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of years as well as a return from dividends 
further  it is a specific measure of our financial success to achieve a return on net assets greater than the cost of capital  creating granite value added 
we believe that the following are key factors in our ability to achieve this objective employee development we believe that our employees are key to the successful implementation of our business strategies 
significant resources are employed to attract  nurture and retain extraordinary talent and fully develop each employee s capabilities 
infrastructure construction focus we concentrate our core competencies on this segment of the construction industry  which includes the building of roads  highways  bridges  dams and tunnels  mass transit facilities  railroad infrastructure and underground utilities as well as site preparation 
this focus allows us to most effectively utilize our specialized strengths  which include grading  paving and concrete structures 
ownership of aggregate materials and construction equipment we own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants that are vertically integrated into our construction operations and we own a large fleet of carefully maintained heavy construction equipment 
by ensuring availability of these resources and providing quality products  we believe we have bidding advantages in many of our markets  as well as a reliable source of revenue and income from the sale of construction materials to unaffiliated parties 
selective bidding we focus our resources to bid on jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria  which include analyzing the risk of a potential job in relation to available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal  as well as personnel to effectively manage and build the project  degree of competition  experience with the type of work  relationship with the owner  local resources and partnerships  equipment resources  size and complexity of the job and profitability 
diversification to mitigate the risks inherent in construction and general economic factors  we pursue projects i in both the public and private sectors  ii for a wide range of customers within each sector from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners  iii in diverse geographic markets  iv that are design build  lump sum and fixed unit price  and v of various sizes  durations and complexity 

table of contents decentralized profit centers we approach each selected market with a local focus through our decentralized structure 
each of our granite west branch offices and granite east regional offices are individual profit centers 
profit based incentives we incentivize our profit center managers with a substantial variable cash and restricted stock incentive element based primarily on the annual profit performance of their respective profit centers 
controlled expansion we intend to continue our expansion by selectively adding branches or branch satellite locations in the western united states  exploring opportunities to establish branch like businesses in other areas of the country through acquisitions  and selectively pursuing major infrastructure projects throughout the nation where we have an established presence 
additionally  we intend to leverage our financial capacity by investing in a limited number of real estate development projects that we believe will provide an acceptable return on our investment 
accident prevention we believe that preventing accidents is both a moral obligation and good business 
by identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards  we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents 
environmental responsibility we believe it benefits everyone to maintain environmentally responsible operations 
we are committed to effective measures to protect the environment and maintain good community relations 
we continually monitor our performance in this area and take our responsibilities to the communities where we work and compliance with government agency requirements seriously 
quality and high ethical standards we emphasize the importance of performing high quality work and maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective corporate compliance program 
customers we have customers in both the public and private sectors 
the largest volume customer of granite west is the california department of transportation caltrans 
in  contracts with caltrans represented of our total revenue  and total public sector revenue generated in california represented of our total revenue 
other granite west customers include departments of transportation of other states  county and city public works departments  school districts and developers and owners of industrial  commercial and residential sites 
granite east s customers are predominantly in the public sector and currently include the numerous state departments of transportation as well as local transit authorities and federal agencies see concentrations in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
backlog our backlog includes the total value of awarded contracts that have not been completed  including our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts 
our backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
approximately billion of the december  backlog is expected to be completed during with the exception of certain federal government contracts  we include a construction project in our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and funding is in place 
substantially all of the contracts in our backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer  however  we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past see contract provisions and subcontracting 
certain granite west projects are added and completed within each year and therefore not reflected in our year end backlog 
backlog by segment is presented in backlog under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents equipment and plants we own many pieces of equipment  including cranes  bulldozers  barges  backhoes  excavators  scrapers  motor graders  loaders  trucks  pavers and rollers as well as construction materials processing plants 
in and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  for construction equipment  plants and vehicles 
additionally  our equipment fleet increased in as a result of our acquisitions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  we owned the following construction equipment  plants and vehicles december  heavy construction equipment units trucks  truck tractors and trailers and vehicles units aggregate crushing plants asphalt concrete plants portland cement concrete batch plants asphalt rubber plants lime slurry plants we believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing because ownership ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower equipment costs 
we keep our equipment as fully utilized as possible by pooling certain equipment for use by both granite west and granite east 
we regularly lease or rent equipment on a short term basis to supplement existing equipment and respond to construction activity peaks 
employees on december   we employed approximately  salaried employees  who work in management  estimating and clerical capacities  plus  hourly employees 
the total number of hourly personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress 
during  the number of hourly employees ranged from  to  and averaged approximately  three of our wholly owned subsidiaries granite construction company  granite construction northeast  inc and wilder construction company wilder are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they work 
we believe our employees are our most valuable resource and that our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company 
among salaried and non union hourly employees  this dedication is reinforced by equity ownership through our employee stock ownership plan  our profit sharing and k plan and performance based incentive compensation arrangements at december  our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately years of service with us 
competition factors influencing our competitiveness include price  reputation for quality  the availability of aggregate materials  machinery and equipment  financial strength  knowledge of local markets and conditions  and project management and estimating abilities 
although some of our competitors are larger than us and may possess greater resources  we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors 
historically  the construction business has not usually required large amounts of capital  particularly for the smaller size construction work pursued by granite west  which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications 
granite west competitors range from small local construction companies to large regional and national construction companies 
while the market areas of these competitors overlap with several of the markets served by our branches  few compete in all of our market areas 
many of our granite west competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors 
when the market for projects in one sector contracts  these competitors will move to the other 
this greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
in addition  we own and or have long term leases on aggregate resources that provide an extra measure of competitive advantage in certain markets 
granite east normally competes with large regional and national construction companies  which may or may not be larger than granite 
although the construction business is highly competitive  we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 

table of contents contract provisions and subcontracting our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yard of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk of performing all the work for the specified amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog increased to approximately at december  compared with approximately at december  our contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local government agencies and private parties 
less frequently  contracts may be obtained through direct negotiations with private owners 
our contract risk mitigation process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process  review of bids fitting certain criteria by various levels of management and  in some cases  by the executive committee of our board of directors 
there are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and results as compared to a project s original bid 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment or materials 
all of these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance  which can drive up costs and lower profits 
conversely  if any of these or other factors are more positive than the assumptions in our bid  project profitability can improve 
however  the ability to realize improvements on project profitability is more limited than the risk of lower profitability 
design build projects carry additional risks such as the risk inherent in estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed and design error risk  including higher construction costs due to any design errors  liability to the contract owner for the design of the project and right of way and permit acquisition costs 
although we manage this additional risk by adding contingencies to our bid amounts  obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible  there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful 
all of our state and federal government contracts and most of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the contract owner  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past 
many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met and these amounts can be significant 
we act as prime contractor on most of the construction projects we undertake 
we accomplish the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work 
as prime contractor  we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
we manage this risk by reviewing the size of the subcontract  the financial stability of the subcontractor and other factors and  based on this review  determine whether to require that the subcontractor furnish a bond or other type of security that guarantees their performance 
disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our best efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged subcontractors 
as with all of our subcontractors  some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security 
insurance and bonding we maintain general and excess liability  construction equipment and workers compensation insurance  all in amounts consistent with industry practices 
in connection with our business  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
the capacity of the surety market is subject to market based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation 
when the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding  in particular for larger  more complex projects throughout the market 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we employ a co surety structure involving three sureties 
although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity has significantly impacted our ability to grow our business  there is no assurance that it will not significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts in the future see item a 
risk factors 

table of contents government and environmental regulations our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal  state and local government agencies and authorities  including regulations concerning workplace safety  labor relations and disadvantaged businesses 
additionally  all of our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non compliance and others  such as the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  impose strict  retroactive  joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances 
we continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws 
while compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
in addition  our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies 
we believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist 
in july  the california air resources board carb approved a regulation that will require california equipment owners operators to reduce diesel particulate emissions from in use off road diesel equipment to meet emission targets proposed for each year from to the emission targets will require california off road diesel equipment owners to retrofit equipment with diesel particulate filters or replace equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available 
between now and the year  granite will be required to implement an equipment management strategy that includes accelerated turnover of off road diesel equipment and retrofitting equipment with carb approved diesel particulate filters 
this will increase equipment related expenses in an amount which has not yet been determined 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica  a common mineral 
also  some of our construction and material processing operations release as dust crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled 
excessive  prolonged inhalation of very small sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease including silicosis 
the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust 
we monitor to verify that our dust control procedures are keeping occupational exposures at or below the requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available when required 
we also communicate  through safety information sheets and other means  what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive  prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in the report or otherwise adversely affect our business 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
the single largest factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel particularly as we grow 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment 
reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on our business 
a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by federal  state and local government agencies 
our ability to obtain future public sector work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid  which is largely a function of the level of government funding available 

table of contents our commercial and residential site development work may be affected by economic downturns 
the availability of private sector work can be adversely affected by economic downturns in the residential housing market  demand for commercial property or the availability of credit 
to the extent these events occur  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost 
as more fully described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid 
accounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting estimates under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  accounting for our contract related revenues and costs  as well as other cost items  requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future  and these changes could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations 
many of our contracts have penalties for late completion 
in some instances  including many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for cost impacts resulting from any delay  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
weather can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work is significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature 
changes in weather conditions can create significant variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease its profitability 
our granite land company is greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry 
our real estate development activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including local real estate market conditions  substantial existing and potential competition  general national  regional and local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability and changes in demographic conditions 
if our outlook for a project s forecasted profitability deteriorates  we may find it necessary to curtail our development activities and evaluate our real estate assets for possible impairment 
if our real estate assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment would result in a charge to income from operations in the year of the impairment with a resulting decrease in our recorded net worth 
we work in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
an inability to secure and permit aggregate reserves could negatively impact our future operations and results 
tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure and permit aggregate reserves 
although we have thus far been able to secure and permit reserves to support our business  it is likely to become increasingly difficult to do so and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure and permit reserves in the future 
we are subject to environmental and other regulation 
as more fully described under government and environmental regulations above  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements  the noncompliance of which can result in substantial penalties  termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 

table of contents strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce 
although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations if they occur in the future 
unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts 
although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
as more fully described in insurance and bonding above  we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts 
our inability to obtain surety bonds in the future would significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform we could be liable for completion of the entire contract and  if the contract were unprofitable  this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment and fire our asphalt concrete processing plants and also constitute a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and sold to outside parties 
although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts  many contracts provide no such protection 
we also use cement  steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future 
as a part of our growth strategy we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve many risks 
these risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from our ongoing operations  potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities  record goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges and incur amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results significantly 
failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
as further described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  we subcontract a portion of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors and we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors  and there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
we may be unable to identify qualified disadvantaged business enterprise dbe contractors to perform as subcontractors 
certain of our government agency projects contain minimum dbe participation clauses 
if we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum dbe participation we may be held responsible for damages due to breach of contract including restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects and monetary damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenue is from government funded contracts 
approximately of our consolidated revenue in was derived from contracts funded by federal  state and local government agencies and authorities 
these government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations  contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation  administration  performance and accounting 
many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions 
as a result of our government contracting  claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations  requirements or statutes 
we may also be subject to qui tam whistle blower litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal civil false claims act  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
further  if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting  including federally funded projects at the state level 
if our government contracts are terminated for any reason  or if we are suspended from government work  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue 
our long term debt and credit arrangements contain restrictive covenants and failure to meet these covenants could significantly harm our financial condition 
our long term debt and credit arrangements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in most cases  failure to meet the restrictive covenants would result in an immediate repayment of all amounts due and cancellation of open lines of credit 
additionally  failure to meet restrictive covenants related to our debt and credit agreements would trigger cross default provisions that would cause us to also be in default of our surety agreements 
although we have not had difficulty meeting these covenants in the past  failure to do so in the future could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

table of contents item legal proceedings silica litigation our wholly owned subsidiary granite construction company gcco is one of approximately to defendants in nine active california superior court lawsuits 
of the nine lawsuits  five were filed against gcco in and four were filed against gcco in  in alameda county riley vs

the m company et al each lawsuit was brought by a single plaintiff who is seeking money damages by way of various causes of action  including strict product and market share liability  and alleges personal injuries caused by exposure to silica products and related materials during the plaintiffs use or association with sand blasting or grinding concrete 
the plaintiff in each lawsuit has categorized the defendants as equipment defendants  respirator defendants  premises defendants and sand defendants 
we have been identified as a sand defendant  meaning a party that manufactured  supplied or distributed silica containing products 
our preliminary investigation revealed that we have not knowingly sold or distributed abrasive silica sand for sandblasting  and therefore  we believe the probability of these lawsuits resulting in an incurrence of a material liability is remote 
we have been dismissed from fifteen other similar lawsuits 
hiawatha project dbe issues the hiawatha light rail transit hlrt project was performed by minnesota transit constructors mntc  a joint venture that consisted of gcco and other unrelated companies 
gcco was the managing partner of the joint venture  with a interest 
the minnesota department of transportation mndot is the contracting agency for this federally funded project 
mndot and the us department of transportation office of inspector general oig each conducted a review of the disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program maintained by mntc for the hlrt project 
in addition  the us department of justice usdoj is conducting an investigation into compliance issues with respect to mntc s dbe program for the hlrt project 
mndot and the oig collectively  the agencies have initially identified certain compliance issues in connection with mntc s dbe program and  as a result  have determined that mntc failed to meet the dbe utilization criteria as represented by mntc 
although there has been no formal administrative subpoena issued  nor has a civil complaint been filed in connection with the administrative reviews or the investigation  mndot has proposed a monetary sanction of million against mntc and specified dbe training for personnel from the members of the mntc joint venture as a condition of future bidding on mndot work by joint venture members of mntc 
mntc is fully cooperating with the agencies and the usdoj and  on july   presented its response to the initial determinations of the agencies as well as the investigation by the usdoj 
we have yet to receive a formal reply from the agencies or the usdoj  although informal discussions have been continuing and we cannot rule out the possibility of a criminal action being brought against mntc or one of its members 
i project dbe issues the i project was performed by a joint venture jv that consisted of gcco and another unrelated party 
gcco was the managing partner of the jv  with a interest 
mndot is the contracting agency for this federally funded project 
mndot conducted a review of the dbe program maintained by the jv for the i project 
mndot has initially identified certain compliance issues in connection with the jv s dbe program  and as a result  has determined that the jv failed to meet the dbe utilization criteria as represented by the jv 
although there has been no formal administrative subpoena  nor has a civil complaint been filed in connection with the administrative reviews  mndot has proposed a monetary sanction of  against the jv and specified dbe training for personnel from the members of the jv as a condition of future bidding on mndot work by joint venture members of the jv 
the jv is fully cooperating with mndot and has the opportunity to present its response to mndot s initial determinations 
the jv is investigating mndot s initial determinations and preparing its response thereto 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any monetary sanction or what  if any  other sanction conditions might ultimately be imposed 
us highway project gcco and its subsidiary  wilder are the members of a joint venture known as yaquina river constructors yrc which is currently constructing a new road alignment of us highway near eddyville  oregon under contract with the oregon department of transportation odot 
the project involves constructing seven miles of new road through steep and forested terrain in the coast range mountains 
during the fall and winter of  extraordinary rain events produced runoff that overwhelmed erosion control measures installed at the project and resulted in discharges to surface water in alleged violations of the stormwater permit 
the oregon department of environmental quality deq has issued notices of violation and fine of  to odot and  to yrc for these alleged violations 
yrc has filed an answer to the notice of violation and is attempting to negotiate resolution with the deq 
the oregon department of justice is conducting a criminal investigation in connection with stormwater runoff from the project 
yrc and its members are fully cooperating in the investigation  but yrc does not know whether criminal or civil charges  if any  will be brought or against whom 
therefore  we cannot estimate what  if any  criminal or civil penalty or conditional assessment will result from this investigation 

table of contents other legal proceedings we are a party to a number of other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business which  from time to time  include inquiries from public agencies seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and related laws and regulations 
we believe that the nature and number of these proceedings and compliance inquiries are typical for a construction firm of our size and scope 
our litigation typically involves claims regarding public liability or contract related issues 
while management currently believes  after consultation with counsel  that the ultimate outcome of such proceedings and compliance inquiries which are currently pending  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties

during the fourth quarter ended december   we incurred a charge of million associated with the acquisition of the remaining shares of wilder construction company see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states as well as one of the largest construction materials production companies in the western united states 
we are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airport infrastructure  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects as well as residential and commercial site development 
we have offices in alaska  arizona  california  florida  minnesota  nevada  new york  texas  utah and washington 
our business involves three operating segments granite west  granite east and granite land company glc 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
the two primary economic drivers of our business are federal  state and local public funding levels and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and locally 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a weak economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for fewer private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
greater competition can reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
a weak economy also tends to produce less tax revenue  thereby decreasing the funds available for spending on public infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as gasoline taxes  which are not necessarily directly impacted by a weak economy 
however  even these funds can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
conversely  higher public funding and or a robust economy will increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign project employees to estimating and bidding activities until another project gets underway  temporarily moving their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in very profitable years and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
in february  we announced an organizational realignment of our business operations which is designed to accommodate growth of our vertically integrated branch business in the west and improve profitability of our large  complex heavy construction division hcd projects 
this realignment involved the reorganization of our operating divisions geographically into granite west and granite east 
granite west includes the operations of our former branch division as well as the western portion of our large project business that was formerly included in hcd 
granite west retains our successful decentralized operating structure  with each of its branch locations aligning under one of three operating groups northwest  northern california and southwest 
granite east includes the eastern portion of our large project business that had been included in hcd and is aligned to focus on enhancing project management oversight and discipline from estimating through execution 
with the division office in lewisville  texas  granite east also operates out of three regional offices the central region  based in lewisville  texas  the southeast region  based in tampa  florida  and the northeast region  based in tarrytown  new york 
during  we completed the reassignment of our large projects in the west from our former heavy construction division to our granite west division with the exception of certain projects nearing completion which remain with our granite east division and made substantial progress on other aspects of the realignment 
as a result  we are reporting granite west and granite east as new reportable segments 
prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the new organizational structure see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents current year overview comparative financial summary years ended december  in thousands total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses provision for reversal of legal judgment goodwill impairment charge  gain on sales of property and equipment operating income acquisition expense  net income our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect improved results from granite east which realized positive gross margins during the year compared with negative gross margins for the year ended december  and higher gross profit from granite west 
our operating results for the year ended december  included increases in general and administrative expenses due primarily to costs incurred to support our acquisitions  growth strategy and higher variable compensation resulting from improved profitability 
additionally  our net income for the year ended december  reflects a one time expense related to our acquisition of the remaining shares of wilder construction company which was partially offset by an increase in non operating income due primarily to the gain on a sale of a building by a partnership in which we hold an equity method investment which was recorded as equity in income of affiliates in our statements of income 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  the valuation of certain assets and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our backlog increased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 

table of contents we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized using the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
in the case of large complex design build projects we may continue to defer profit recognition beyond the point of completion based on an evaluation of specific project risks 
the factors considered in this evaluation of risk associated with each design build project include the stage of design completion  the stage of construction completion  status of outstanding purchase orders and subcontracts  certainty of quantities  certainty of schedule and the relationship with the owner 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders  which occur in most large projects  is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
provisions are recognized in the statements of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected when known 
the completion threshold for the start of contract profit recognition is applied to all percentage of completion projects unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to provide materially reliable estimates 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due primarily to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
substantial changes in cost estimates  particularly in our larger  more complex projects have had and can in future periods have a significant effect on our profitability 
valuation of real estate held for development and sale and other long lived assets real estate held for development and sale and other long lived assets  which include property  equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fas no 
 impairment of long lived assets fas 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value  which is generally determined based on the sum of the cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
in  our analysis determined that a million portion of our real estate held for development and sale was impaired 
as a result  we recorded this amount as an impairment charge in the quarter ended december  the process of estimating future cash flows related to an asset involves significant judgment  including future cash inflows related to the use or eventual sale of the asset and future cash outflows related to the development or use of the asset 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
insurance estimates we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first  to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would result in a change in our assessment of the ultimate liability that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

these decreases were partially offset by increased california public sector revenue  primarily driven by a higher volume of projects available to bid 
we continue to see additional competition for the available public sector work  as competitors migrate from the increasingly scarce private sector work 
our revenue from the west excluding california in included approximately million generated as a result of our acquisition of certain assets of the superior group of companies on april  other than northern nevada  our locations outside of california have generally been less impacted by the slowing of residential construction

under the realignment  granite east retained a project in the west that was nearing completion and the decrease in revenue in the west reflects progress on the retained project over time 
in the south and northeast the decreases were due primarily to certain large projects in texas and new york nearing completion 
increases in the southeast resulted from revenue contributions from a large design build project in mississippi that was awarded in february increases in the midwest resulted from revenue contributions from a large design build project in missouri that was awarded in the fourth quarter of the percent of our revenue from fixed price contracts increased in due primarily to a higher percentage of design build projects in our backlog

granite land company revenue revenue from glc for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  glc s revenue is dependent on the timing of real estate sales transactions  which are relatively few in number and can cause variability in the timing of revenue and profit recognition

the lower public sector backlog in california was largely due to increased competition for the available work as contractors migrate from the increasingly scarce private sector work 
additionally  the lower public sector backlog reflects progress on a million joint venture highway reconstruction project in utah that was awarded at the end of granite west project awards in the fourth quarter included a million highway reconstruction project near the california nevada border

the backlog increase in the southeast was offset by lower backlog in the other granite east geographic areas as we continued our strategy of bidding at higher margins in our home markets 
additional project awards during the year ended december  included a million freeway project in texas  a million turnpike project in florida and approximately million in additional awards related to our share of a joint venture project to construct a transportation hub at the world trade center in new york

in the case of large  complex design build projects  we may continue to defer profit recognition beyond the point of completion until such time as we believe we have enough information to make a reasonably dependable estimate of contract revenue and cost 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in granite west  this policy generally has a lesser impact on granite west s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  granite east has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than granite west projects 
as a result  granite east gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach our completion threshold and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross margin recognition 
revenue from projects less than our completion threshold  for which no margin has been recognized  was as follows revenue from contracts with deferred profit years ended december  in thousands granite west granite east total revenue from contracts with deferred profit additionally  as we also describe under critical accounting estimates we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders in our forecasts when we are contractually obligated to incur them 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary during periods where a large volume of change orders or contract claims are pending resolution reducing gross profit percent or  conversely  during periods where large change orders or contract claims are agreed or settled increasing gross profit percent 
although this variability can occur in both granite west and granite east  it can be much more pronounced in granite east because of the larger size and complexity of its projects 
granite west gross profit as a percent of revenue for increased to from for the increase was largely due to the positive effect of project forecast changes in of approximately million due to the settlement of outstanding issues with contract owners  higher productivity than originally estimated and the resolution of certain project uncertainties 
additionally  in granite west was negatively impacted by approximately million in net project forecast changes primarily from the estimated loss recorded on our highway project in western oregon see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

two of our joint venture projects are currently forecast at a loss and will require additional capital contributions from our minority partners if the forecasts do not improve 
our joint venture agreements require that such capital contributions be made if needed 
based on our most recent assessment of our partners financial condition  we currently believe that one of our partners does not have the ability to contribute its full proportionate share of the additional capital that will be needed if the project forecast does not improve

minority interest balances related to loss projects of million and million at december  and  respectively have been included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
outlook we are optimistic about our opportunities in the diversity and resiliency of our business model and our employees capabilities will prove to be extremely valuable this year as we confront the economic challenges facing some of our branch businesses in the west and capitalize on the opportunities to increase profitability on our large projects in the east 
in our granite east business  we expect to see continued earnings improvement through driven by a strong backlog of work and improved execution  we are currently forecasting granite east to achieve gross margins in the low teens 
we have targeted several projects in each of our three granite east regions to pursue this year  however  we will remain very selective with regard to the projects we bid 
our strategy for this business has not changed 
we will continue to focus on our home markets with the near term goal to maintain a granite east business with revenues which allow us the best opportunity to maximize profitability and successfully execute at the project level 
we anticipate to be a challenging year for granite west due to the continued downturn in the residential construction market  which is expected to negatively impact several of our branches  particularly those in the central valley of california and northern nevada 
competition in these markets is likely to remain high at least through the end of in this type of market  our bidding strategy is to be patient and cautious to avoid committing our capacity to lower margin work because we believe better opportunities will be available later in the year 
in contrast  some of our branches are poised to have a solid year  driven by a strong backlog  healthy markets and steady demand for our construction materials 
overall  we anticipate that granite west will perform well in given the expected market conditions  however  we do not expect the business to perform near the level it has over the past two years 
our focus this year will be on targeting those opportunities where we have a competitive advantage 

table of contents despite the current challenges  the long term outlook for granite west remains extremely positive 
we are well positioned in our markets with our construction businesses  aggregate reserves  key plant facilities  and most importantly  teams of experienced and dedicated people 
although not expected in  we look forward to the ultimate recovery of the housing market which we believe will mark the beginning of another performance improvement cycle in granite west 
with regard to our granite land company  our strategy going forward is to enhance our regional and project diversity 
despite the impairment write down of a residential property in california during  we are very pleased with the overall quality of our real estate investment portfolio 
in  our goal is to work diligently on entitlements  construct improvements and evaluate longer term sales to optimize the varying time for recovery in our sub regional markets 
on the political front  federal and state transportation funding for is expected to remain healthy 
the fiscal federal appropriations bill package provides billion for the core highway program  consistent with the level authorized in the current safe  accountable  flexible  efficient  transportation  equity act a legacy for users safetea lu  with an additional billion to repair deficient bridges 
in the bill  the fiscal federal transit program will be funded at billion 
this represents an overall increase in federal transportation funding of billion over fiscal looking ahead  we were not pleased to hear that the administration s proposed federal budget for fiscal proposes a cut in federal aid highway obligation limits of billion from fiscal spending levels 
with the congressional budget office s recent projections indicating a revenue shortfall in the highway account of billion less than the amount needed to meet safetea lu s highway funding commitments in fiscal  house leadership has identified trust fund solvency as a top priority for the congressional session 
transportation funding post saftea lu is a topic that will be highly debated over the year ahead 
in january  the national surface policy and revenue study commission  created by safetea lu  issued its long awaited report 
after two years of reviewing the status of the nation s surface transportation infrastructure and conducting field hearings across the country  the report contains several recommendations that will likely spur debate as discussions begin about the reauthorization of the federal government s role in transportation finance and policy 
the report proposes a complete overhaul of the current federal program 
significantly  the report calls for a to increase in the federal gasoline user fee to be phased in over five years  then indexed for inflation 
the report estimates that the nation will need to invest at least billion annually over the next years to upgrade the existing surface transportation systems highways  transit and passenger rail to a state of good repair 
this would nearly triple the annual rate of billion that is being spent at all levels of government on all modes today 
in california  the state s fiscal situation and the potential impact on transportation funding has been an issue we have also been watching closely 
fortunately  despite the current economic downturn  neither the governor nor legislative leaders are proposing cuts to transportation in the upcoming budget year 
the governor s recently announced proposed budget includes full funding for proposition approximately billion annually and approximately billion in proposition b transportation funds 
with regard to raw materials costs  we are subject to energy and petroleum related price volatility as it relates to our use of diesel fuel for our rolling stock equipment  natural gas  propane and diesel fuel to heat our hot plants  as well as liquid asphalt for production of asphaltic concrete 
we manage our exposure to these price changes by monitoring the escalation of these commodities and pricing them into our projects and contracts accordingly 
some of our contracts include clauses for liquid asphalt and fuel escalation and de escalation that provide protection in the event that oil product prices change significantly 
although we are exposed to price spikes in projects that do not include such clauses  this potential impact can be mitigated by our significant portfolio of smaller  short duration projects that minimizes cost escalations and provides the ability to price new business at the higher prices 
longer term  we are excited about our opportunities ahead  largely driven by record levels of public transportation funding in california  the company s largest revenue producing state  as well as improving results from our large projects business 
demand for our construction materials is also expected to remain healthy over the long term 
we foresee bidding opportunities for large projects to continue to be robust  which will help support our strategy in granite east of bidding new work selectively with considerably higher levels of profitability 
in summary  we are very pleased with our business performance to date  which has occurred despite the impact of the weakening housing market 
our granite west business proved its durability in an uncertain economic environment during and is poised to perform well in the continued economic unrest of our granite east business is clearly on the road to improved profitability and on track for continued improvement going forward 
overall  we are very optimistic about the long term view of our markets and are confident that our continued investment in the development of our people is key to increasing shareholder value over the long term

granite west construction gross profit as a percent of revenue in increased to from in granite west gross profit from the sale of materials as a percent of revenue in increased to from in also  absent the realignment effect  granite west gross profit for included the effects of changes in the estimates of the profitability of certain projects 
the net impact of these estimate changes for was an increase in gross profit of approximately million due primarily to the settlement of outstanding issues on two projects with no associated cost  partially offset by increases in estimated costs on several other projects 
the net impact of such estimate changes for was a decrease in gross profit of approximately million due primarily to unanticipated costs related to quality issues in work originally performed by a subcontractor on one project and changes in site conditions from our original expectations on a second project

provision for legal judgment in june  we recorded a provision of million related to an unfavorable judgment in a legal proceeding 
in january  we entered into an agreement to resolve the related dispute which resulted in a partial reversal of the provision during the year ended december  goodwill impairment charge the goodwill balance represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net assets acquired in our acquisition of our granite northeast operation in new york gne  a reporting unit in granite east operating segment 
during the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and that a full impairment of goodwill existed 
this impairment conclusion was reached due to continuing losses at gne  including significant unexpected losses in the quarter ended december gain on sales of property and equipment gain on sales of property and equipment for the year ended december  included approximately million from the sale of a rental property recognized in the first quarter of other income expense interest income increased million  or  in compared with due primarily to a higher average yield on higher average balances of interest bearing investments

table of contents liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents excluding consolidated joint ventures consolidated joint venture cash and cash equivalents  total consolidated cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  other investments and share repurchases 
we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities totaled million at december  and included million of cash and cash equivalents from our consolidated joint ventures see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this joint venture cash is for the working capital needs of each joint venture s project 
the decision to distribute cash must generally be made jointly by all of the partners 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next twelve months and beyond 
if we experience a significant change in our business such as the execution of a significant acquisition  we would likely need to acquire additional sources of financing  which may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants  or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements 
cash provided by operating activities of million in represents a million decrease from the amount provided by operating activities during operating cash flow in benefited from an increase in net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings resulting from large cash payments received to mobilize projects in the early stages of construction  which have the effect of increasing cash flow in the periods received and decreasing cash flow in subsequent periods as cash is expended toward project completion 
net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings decreased slightly in the decrease in cash flow from net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in was partially offset by cash generated from lower accounts receivable balances at december  net of the effect of lower accounts payable balances  due primarily to lower revenue particularly in the fourth quarter 
cash provided by operating activities in increased by million from primarily due to slower accounts receivable growth in compared with and an increase in net billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in cash used in investing activities of million for represents a million decrease from the amount used in due primarily to a reduction in the purchases of marketable securities and an increase in the maturities of marketable securities 
this decrease was partially offset by the use of cash to fund the acquisition of certain assets of two businesses see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and cash deposited into an escrow account related to our purchase of the remaining shares of wilder construction company see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities in increased by million from due primarily to higher net purchases of marketable securities and net additions to property and equipment in cash provided by financing activities of million for represents an increase of million from due primarily to million in new debt issued in december see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase was partially offset by our repayments of debt borrowed under our bank revolving line of credit and repurchases of our common stock 
cash used in financing activities in was million higher than due primarily to increases in net repayments of long term debt and net distributions to minority partners in 
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations outstanding as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations under construction contracts other purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations total these obligations represent the aggregate minimum principal maturities of long term debt and do not include interest 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these obligations represent the minimum rental commitments and minimum royalty requirements under all noncancellable operating leases 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these obligations represent our best estimate of future purchases of materials and subcontract services related to our current contract backlog 
these obligations represent firm purchase commitments for equipment and other goods and services not connected with our construction backlog which are individually greater than  and have an expected purchase after february  the timing of expected payment of deferred compensation is based on estimated dates of retirement 
actual dates of retirement could be different and would cause the timing of payments to change 
reserves for uncertain tax positions of approximately million are not included in the table above because we cannot estimate the timing of payments related to such reserves 
we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire between march and february we are generally required by the beneficiaries of these standby letters of credit to replace them upon expiration 
additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 
we have a million bank revolving line of credit  which allows for unsecured borrowings through june   with interest rate options 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit is at our choice of selected libor rates plus a margin that is recalculated quarterly 
the margin was at december  the unused and available portion of this line of credit was million at december  in december  we issued new debt in the amount of million 
these notes are due in five equal installments beginning in and bear interest at per annum 
restrictive covenants under the terms of our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
in october  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase  at management s discretion  up to million of our common stock 
under the new repurchase program  the company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in private transactions 
the company intends to fund the repurchases through the use of existing sources of liquidity  borrowings under the current credit facility or new borrowings 
the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
the share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
this new program replaced the million share repurchase program announced in at december   million of the million authorization was available for repurchases see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
subsequent to december  through february  we repurchased and retired an additional million shares for million 

table of contents included in the million balance of real estate held for development and sale at december  is approximately million related to residential housing projects 
due to the downturn in the residential housing market we assessed whether our investments related to these projects were impaired 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  related to a project in central california  which is an area that has been particularly impacted by the slowing demand for new housing construction see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
joint ventures  off balance sheet arrangements we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
we also participate in various line item joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work 
the revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated with its own work 
all partners in a line item joint venture are jointly and severally liable for the completion of the total project under the terms of the contract with the project owner 
there is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture 
each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self performed contract 
we account for our portion of these contracts as project revenues and costs in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work in our consolidated financial statements 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures provide that each party will assume and pay its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december   approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share of unconsolidated construction joint ventures or work that our partners are directly responsible for in line item joint ventures  had yet to be completed 
during  we recorded approximately million in additional minority interest cost related to our assessment that our partner in one construction joint venture project would be unable to pay its full share of the project s projected loss 
prior to  we had never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however  it is possible that we could record additional losses in the future and such losses could be significant

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we are prohibited from investing in auction rate and certain asset backed securities 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the portfolio is limited to an average maturity of no more than one year from date of purchase 
on an ongoing basis we monitor the credit ratings  financial condition and other factors that could impact the carrying amount of our investment portfolio 
marketable securities  consisting of us government obligations  commercial paper and municipal bonds  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
additionally we have a mutual fund portfolio which is classified as available for sale 
unrealized gains and losses on these mutual fund investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
we currently do not have any material business transactions in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
our mutual fund portfolio of million is exposed to equity price risks 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  anticipated declining interest rates will negatively impact our investment income 
at december  we had outstanding i senior notes payable of million which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in  ii senior notes payable of million which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in  and iii senior notes payable of million  which carry a fixed rate interest of per annum with principal payments due in five equal annual installments beginning in the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  held to maturity investments and significant debt obligations in thousands thereafter total assets cash  cash equivalents and held to maturity investments weighted average interest rate liabilities fixed rate debt senior notes payable weighted average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term held to maturity investments approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the generally short maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor difference between the effective yields of these investments and rates currently available on similar instruments 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the lower fixed borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december
