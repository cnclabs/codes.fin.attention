these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
we discuss many of these risks and uncertainties at the beginning of this annual report on form k and under item business and item a risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of anika therapeutics  inc and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
management overview anika therapeutics  inc anika  the company  we  us or our develops  manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products for tissue protection  healing  and repair 
these products are based on hyaluronic acid ha  a naturally occurring  biocompatible polymer found throughout the body 
due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties  ha plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints  the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues  and the transport of molecules to and within cells 
our currently manufactured and marketed products consist of orthovisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of some forms of osteoarthritis in humans  amvisc  amvisc plus  staarvisc ii  and shellgel  each an injectable ophthalmic viscoelastic ha product  hyvisc  which is an ha product used in the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  and incert is an ha based anti adhesive for surgical applications 
in the us orthovisc is marketed by depuy mitek  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  under the terms of a licensing  distribution  supply and marketing agreement 
outside the us  orthovisc has been approved for sale since and is marketed by distributors in approximately countries 
we developed and manufacture amvisc and amvisc plus for bausch lomb incorporated under a multiyear supply agreement 
hyvisc is marketed in the us through boehringer ingelheim vetmedica  inc incert is currently marketed in three countries outside of the us elevess is designed as a family of aesthetic dermatology products for facial wrinkles  scar remediation and lip augmentation 
our initial elevess product is approved in the us  eu and canada  and is manufactured by anika 
products in development include next generation osteoarthritis joint health related products and elevess products 
osteoarthritis business our osteoarthritis business contributed to our product revenue reflecting an increase in sales of compared to we have marketed orthovisc  our product for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee  internationally since through various distribution agreements 
international sales of orthovisc contributed of product revenue for the year ended december  and decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to a change in the turkish government s reimbursement policy for more than drugs  including orthovisc and its competing products 
we do not expect sales of orthovisc in turkey to reach the level of million  but do believe it represents a good private pay business opportunity 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued discussions with potential distributors in eastern europe and other parts of the world 
in addition  we have product registrations in process for orthovisc in china  india  saudi arabia  and taiwan 
our partners will be seeking regulatory clearance for orthovisc in these markets  some of which  including china  will require clinical trials 
we continue to seek new distribution partnerships around the world 
we expect international sales to significantly increase in from the levels reported in orthovisc became available for sale in the us on march   and is marketed by johnson johnson  under the jnj agreement 
the jnj agreement was originally entered into with ortho biotech products  lp obp  also a johnson johnson company  and was assigned to depuy mitek in mid sales of orthovisc in the us contributed of our product revenue for the year ended december   or increased by compared to for the year ended december   depuy mitek s sales to end users were higher than in the same period in the significant increase in us sales is partially due to depuy mitek s ability to leverage the separate reimbursement code granted in december along with the addition of sales specialists 
these improvements have led to an increase in underlying sales to end users which  combined with an increase in unit sales to depuy mitek for compared to  were the primary reasons for the increase in us sales 
in december  the centers for medicare and medicaid services assigned a unique reimbursement code to our orthovisc product  effective january  this move has simplified the current reimbursement process and improved access to orthovisc 
us sales of hyvisc  our product for the treatment of equine osteoarthritis  contributed to product revenue for the year ended december  and increased from we expect hyvisc sales to be relatively flat in we continue to look at other veterinary applications and opportunities to expand geographic territories 
ophthalmic business our ophthalmic business includes ha viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery 
for the year ended december   sales of ophthalmic products contributed of our product revenue reflecting a decrease in sales of ophthalmic products of compared to sales to bausch lomb accounted for of ophthalmic sales for and contributed of product revenue for the period 
aesthetic dermatology business elevess is designed as a family of aesthetic dermatology products for facial wrinkles  scar remediation and lip augmentation  and is intended to supplant collagen based products and to compete with other ha based products currently on the market 
our aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary chemically modified  cross linked ha 
we received european and united states fda approvals for our initial product in april and july of  respectively 
we recorded  of sales of elevess in  which represented sales of samples to galderma under our former license and development agreement and supply agreement for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of hyaluronic acid based aesthetic dermatology products 
under the terms of the former agreements  the company received on june  a non refundable  upfront payment of  which the company was amortizing over a year period 
during the third quarter  the company received  milestone payments under the agreements related to regulatory approvals of elevess in the united states and europe 
subsequent to the achievements of the regulatory approval milestones  we experienced technical and business disagreements with galderma pharma regarding the development and commercialization of the elevess family of products 
the disagreements concern certain aspects of the formulation of the current and future products as well as some elements of the strategy for commercialization 
in november  the agreements were terminated  we paid galderma  and reacquired the worldwide rights and control of the future development and marketing of elevess 
we have received positive feedback from physicians and patients introduced to elevess and the product is ready for market 
we currently intend to proceed expeditiously towards commercialization 
with a technologically enhanced product that is approved in the us  european union and canada  we expect to launch the product as soon as possible with a new partner  or initially on our own 
anti adhesion business incert is an ha based product for prevention of post surgical adhesions 
the product was approved and ce marked for commercial marketing 
ce marking approval for commercial marketing and sale was received in the third quarter of sales of incert were  and  for the years and  respectively

we expect to file our ce mark application and commence a european study for this product in summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue from the sales of products we manufacture upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
product revenue also includes royalties 
royalty revenue is based on our distributor s sales and recognized in the same period our distributor records their sale of the product 
license  milestone and contract revenue consists of revenue from contract initial and milestone payments received from partners 
the company s business strategy includes entering into collaborative license  development and or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of the company s products 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones  supply of products and royalties on product sales 
the company evaluates each agreement and elements within each agreement in accordance with eitf under eitf  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have stand alone value and there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
in general  non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  sfas r share based payment  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 apb accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the company also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the company elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights using the black scholes valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of the company s stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
the company uses historical data on exercise of stock options and other factors to estimate the expected term of share based awards 
the company also evaluates forfeitures periodically and adjusts accordingly 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the unadjusted historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on us treasury interest rates at the time of grants 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards 
asset valuation 
asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  investments  inventories  and intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  and the age of the receivable 
the determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held  market conditions  length of the impairment  magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held and forecasted demand 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual recovery could be less than our estimate 
intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
income taxes 
beginning january   the company began accounting for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold 
as a result of the adoption of fin there was no change to the tax reserve for unrecognized tax benefits 
as such  there was no change to retained earnings as of january  it is the company s policy to classify accrued interest and penalties as part of the accrued fin liability and record the expense in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   income tax related interest and penalties were immaterial 
our us federal income tax returns for the years and remain subject to examination  and our state income tax returns for all years through remain subject to examination 
we record a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse 
as of december   management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and  therefore  a valuation allowance has not been recorded

product revenue by product line 
product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared with  for the year ended december  year ended december  ophthalmic products   orthovisc   hyvisc   others   ophthalmic products sales decreased  or  to  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales to bausch lomb in compared to due to their inventory management efforts 
our sales of orthovisc increased  or  to  in as compared with  in the increase in orthovisc sales for was primarily due to an increase in domestic sales by depuy mitek 
depuy mitek s sales increased by in compared to thereby gaining market share 
this resulted in a significant increase in our us revenue which totaled  or of product sales  in compared to  or of product sales  in international sales of orthovisc decreased to  or from  in compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in international sales was due to a reimbursement change in turkey 
in the third quarter of  the government of turkey eliminated reimbursement for over drugs including orthovisc and its competing products 
we did not ship product to our turkish distributor during the months ended may starting in june  sales to turkey have been at a lower level reflective of a private pay business 
sales to turkey represented of product sales in versus in we expect orthovisc sales to increase in compared to  both in the us and internationally 
sales of hyvisc increased  or  to  in as compared with  in sales of hyvisc are made to a single customer under an exclusive agreement which was extended in april to december  we expect hyvisc sales to be relatively flat in compared to sales of incert increased  to  in as compared with  in  as interest in the product as an anti adhesive for use in surgical procedures grows 
incert is currently distributed in three european countries  and the company is considering territorial expansion 
we expect modest growth for this product 
elevess sales of  in represent sales of samples to our former distributor galderma during the year 
the company is actively seeking new distribution partners 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to  for licensing and milestone revenue includes the ratable recognition of the  in up front and milestone payments from ortho biotech 
these amounts are being recognized in income ratably over the ten year expected life of the agreement  or  per year

product gross profit and margin 
product gross profit for the year ended december  was  or of product revenue  compared with  or of product revenue  for the year ended december  the improvement in product gross margin was primarily related to a more favorable product mix

research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior year 
research and development expenses include those costs associated with our in house and external research and development efforts for the development of elevess product enhancements  next generation osteoarthritis products  the costs of clinical trials  manufacturing process improvements  and the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals at all relevant stages of development 
the increase in research and development expenses during was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical trial expenses  engineering related expenses for the scale up of elevess for commercial sales and additional headcount compared to we expect research and development expenses will increase in the future related to next generation orthovisc products  and other research and development programs in the pipeline 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by  or  to  from  in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to rent and operating expenses at our new facility located in bedford  massachusetts

operating expense related to the new facility will be mostly recorded in general and administrative expenses until manufacturing operations occupies the building  which is currently expected to occur in interest income  net 
net interest income of  for the year ended december   was essentially flat compared with  in interest income in is expected to decrease as a result of lower expected available cash due to capital investments in the company s new facility project 
income taxes 
income tax provision was  and  for and  respectively 
the reduction in effective tax rate in and difference from the us federal statutory rate is primarily due to a favorable impact of a state investment tax credit as a result of the new facility project  a domestic manufacturing deduction  an increase in state and federal research and development credits  and the tax benefits realized from disqualifying events related to incentive stock option exercises 
a reconciliation of the us federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate for the periods ending december is as follows computed expected tax expense state tax expense net of federal benefit permanent items  including nondeductible expenses state investment tax credit federal and state research and development credits other tax expense we have a pending massachusetts state audit related to and tax returns

domestically  sales by depuy mitek showed good progress with their unit sales more than doubling in compared to this resulted in a significant increase in royalty revenue for anika 
in addition  we resumed shipping orthovisc to depuy mitek in january as they had brought their inventory levels back to their target levels

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement 
on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the company as of january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning january  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we have limited commitments for purchases of inventories 
we expect to incur significant capital investments related to the buildout of our new facility in bedford  massachusetts 
our plan is to fund the project with cash on hand and debt 
on january   the company entered into an unsecured credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  our lender will make periodic loans to the company through december  of up to a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding of  buildout and validation work at the bedford facility commenced in the spring of and is expected to continue into to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of our products under current and future distribution agreements  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost of maintaining adequate manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products  the terms of such strategic alliances  including provisions and our ability to satisfy such provisions that provide upfront and or milestone payments to us  the cost of maintaining adequate inventory levels to meet current and future product demands  and the contractual obligation to make principal and interest debt payments 
we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements beyond see item a 
risk factors 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets
