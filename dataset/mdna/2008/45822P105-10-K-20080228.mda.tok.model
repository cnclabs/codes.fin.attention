other matters customer segmentation in  paper production facilities and one wholesale customer a private utility that primarily provides power to paper mills accounted for of integrys energy group s regulated electric utility revenues 
residential sales accounted for of integrys energy group s regulated electric utility revenues in seasonality integrys energy group s regulated electric utility sales in wisconsin generally follow a seasonal pattern due to the air conditioning requirements of customers that are primarily impacted by the variability of summer temperatures 
regulated electric utility sales in michigan follow no significant seasonal trend due to cooler climate conditions in the upper peninsula of michigan 
generally during the winter months  the purchase price of fuel natural gas and fuel oil for heating load and generation production is heavily influenced by weather and the availability of baseload generation units within the miso energy market 
sustained colder than normal weather and unexpected extended generation outages can influence fuel supply and demand  impacting the production costs at integrys energy group s natural gas and oil fired facilities  as well as natural gas supply commitments under power purchase agreements 
for integrys energy group s electric segment  the impact on utility production costs is managed through wpsc s energy market risk management plan 
competition the retail electric utility market in wisconsin is regulated by the pscw 
retail electric customers currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier 
however  in order to increase sales  utilities work to attract new commercial industrial customers into their service territory 
as a result  there is competition among utilities to keep energy rates low 
wisconsin utilities have continued to refine regulated tariffs in order to provide customers with the true cost of electric energy to each class of customer by reducing or eliminating rate subsidies among different ratepayer classes 
although wisconsin electric energy markets are regulated  utilities still face competition from other energy sources 
michigan electric energy markets are open to competition  however  an active competitive market has not yet developed in the upper peninsula of michigan primarily due to a lack of excess generation and transmission system capacity

natural gas supply integrys energy group s natural gas utilities manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts  storage services and pipeline transportation services designed to meet their varying load pattern at the lowest reasonable cost 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas subsidiaries contract for fixed term firm natural gas supplies with various natural gas suppliers each year to meet the november through march winter period demand of firm system sales customers 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of physical fixed price purchases  storage contracted and owned  natural gas call options and physical index purchases  and through the purchase of additional natural gas supplies on the monthly spot market through fixed term firm contracts to supplement natural gas supplies and minimize risk 
during periods of colder than normal weather  purchasing natural gas in the daily spot market may be necessary 
integrys energy group s regulated natural gas operations contract for domestic natural gas supplies and limit their purchases to minimize potential stranded natural gas supply contract costs 
under current regulatory practice  the icc  pscw  mpuc  and mpsc allow integrys energy groups regulated natural gas utilities to pass the prudently incurred cost of natural gas on to customers on a dollar for dollar basis through purchased gas adjustment clauses 
changes in the cost of natural gas are reflected in both natural gas revenues and natural gas purchases  thus having little or no impact on net income 
for further information on integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations and note  commitments and contingencies 
integrys energy group s natural gas utilities contract with various underground storage facilities for underground natural gas storage capacity and have company owned storage 
besides providing the ability to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand  storage also provides integrys energy group with the ability to purchase natural gas at high load factors on a year round basis  thus lowering supply cost volatility 
integrys energy group has approximately million therms of firm natural gas storage capacity under contract and approximately million therms of firm natural gas storage capacity located in its distribution system 
regulatory matters the natural gas retail rates of integrys energy group are regulated by the icc  pscw  mpsc  and mpuc 
pgl utilizes its storage and pipeline supply assets as a natural gas hub 
this activity is regulated by the ferc and consists of providing wholesale transportation and storage services in interstate commerce 
for additional information  see note  regulatory environment 
other matters seasonality the natural gas throughput of integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utilities follows a seasonal pattern due to the heating requirements of customers that is primarily impacted by the variability in winter temperatures 
competition integrys energy group s regulated natural gas utility operations face competition with other entities and forms of energy in varying degrees  particularly for large commercial and industrial customers who have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels 
due to the volatility of natural gas prices  integrys energy group has seen customers with dual fuel capability switch to alternate fuels for short periods of time  then switch back to natural gas as market rates change 
interruptible natural gas sales and natural gas transportation service is offered for customers to enable them to reduce their energy costs 
transportation customers purchase their natural gas directly from third party natural gas suppliers at market prices and contract with integrys energy group s entities to transport the natural gas from pipelines to their facilities 
additionally  some customers still purchase their natural gas commodity directly from one of integrys energy group s entities but have elected to do so on an interruptible basis  as a means to reduce their costs 
customers continue to switch between firm system supply  interruptible system supply and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change

seasonality integrys energy services believes that its business  in the aggregate  is not seasonal  even though certain products sell more heavily in some seasons than in others 
sales of natural gas generally peak in the winter months  while sales of electric energy generally peak in the summer months 
generally in the summer months  the demand for electric energy is high  which increases the price at which energy can be sold 
in periods of high residential fuel consumption generally the winter months  the purchase price of oil and natural gas increases  which increases the production costs at integrys energy services natural gas and oil fired generation facilities

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  when making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us 
we may not successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we continue to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy 
while we expect to identify cost savings and growth opportunities before we acquire companies or assets  we may not be able to achieve these anticipated benefits due to  among other things delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets  higher than expected costs or a need to allocate additional resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties  parameters imposed or delays caused by regulatory agencies  reliance on inaccurate assumptions in evaluating the expected benefits of a given acquisition  inability to retain key employees or customers of acquired companies  and assumption of liabilities not identified in the due diligence process 
these risks apply to our acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  as well as the merger with pec 
the integration of pec presents significant challenges and we are incurring significant transaction  merger related and restructuring costs that may result in a decline in the anticipated potential benefits of the merger with pec 
integrys energy group expects the merger with pec to generate potential pre tax cost synergy savings of million on an annualized basis by the end of the fifth full year of operations following completion of the merger excluding costs of integration 
these savings may not be realized within the time periods or amounts contemplated 
in addition to the risks noted above related to other potential or future acquisitions  the difficulties of combining the previously independent operations of integrys energy group and pec include  but are not limited to  the following combining the best practices of two companies  including utility operations  non regulated energy marketing operations and staff functions  the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  reducing the costs associated with each company s operations  and preserving important relationships of both companies and resolving potential conflicts that may arise 
the process of combining operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the businesses of integrys energy group and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  financial condition  or prospects of integrys energy group  integrys energy group is incurring and expects in the future to continue to incur integration and restructuring costs associated with combining its operations with pec  as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger 
the estimated total pre tax cost of achieving anticipated merger synergies and cost savings is approximately million excluding internal labor costs  most of which will be incurred through although integrys energy group expects the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses  to offset incremental transaction  merger related and restructuring costs over time  net benefits may not be achieved in the near term 
integrys energy group has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect the company s operating results 
the merger with pec and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in minnesota and michigan are accounted for as purchases by integrys energy group in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities acquired have been recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition and added to those of integrys energy group 
the reported financial condition and results of operations of integrys energy group reflect pec balances and results after completion of the merger  but such financial statements have not been and will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of pec for periods prior to the merger 
the earnings of integrys energy group also reflect purchase accounting adjustments 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total purchase price is allocated to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair market values as of the date the merger was completed 
the excess cost of the acquisition over those estimated fair market values is recorded as goodwill 
as a result of the application of purchase accounting  these transactions resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired  integrys energy group may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment 
such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on the operating results of integrys energy group 
we are subject to changes in government regulation  which may have a negative impact on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
the rates our regulated utilities are allowed to charge for their retail and wholesale services are some of the most important items influencing our business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies  which significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers 
in particular  the pscw  icc  mpsc  mpuc  ferc  sec  epa  minnesota office of pipeline safety  wdnr  and the illinois environmental protection agency regulate many aspects of our utility operations  including siting and construction of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities and the rates that we can charge customers 
we are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies to operate our business 
we are unable to predict the impact on our businesses and operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
however  changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional expenses or change business operations  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  federal regulatory reforms may produce unexpected changes and costs in the public utility industry 
a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
we cannot be sure that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could increase our borrowing costs  require us to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors  increase our borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities  limit our access to the commercial paper market  limit the availability of adequate credit support for integrys energy services operations  and require provision of additional credit assurance to contract counterparties 
we may not complete construction projects within estimated project costs 
subsidiaries of intergrys energy group undertake very large and complex construction projects  subject to numerous unpredictable events that could affect our ability to timely complete construction within estimated costs 
we may not be able to meet these construction estimates due to  among other things fluctuating or unanticipated construction costs  supply delays  legal claims  and environmental regulation 
our operations are subject to risks beyond our control  including but not limited to weather  terrorist attacks or related acts of war 
our revenues are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas 
that demand can vary greatly based upon weather conditions  seasonality  and temperature extremes  fluctuations in economic activity and growth in our regulated service areas  as well as areas in which our nonregulated subsidiaries operate  and the amount of additional energy available from current or new competitors 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  the cost of repairing damage to our facilities due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events  in excess of reserves established for such repairs  may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to cover such terrorist activity may impact our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways 
these actions could also result in disruptions of power and fuel markets 
in addition  our natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities  fines  penalties  and litigation could exceed our estimates 
compliance with current and future federal and state environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
integrys energy group cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
on march   the epa adopted the clean air mercury rule  which is intended to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired generation plants 
on february   a court decision vacated the federal rule 
as a result  future impacts on integrys energy group or its subsidiaries resulting from future federal or state regulation regarding mercury emissions is uncertain 
the epa has also issued the clean air interstate rule requiring reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
in addition  the possibility exists of future initiatives to address concerns about global climate change such as the potential regulation of greenhouse gases emitted from generation facilities 
integrys energy group cannot be certain how these rules will affect it 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties 
citizen groups that feel there are compliance issues not sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may also bring citizen enforcement actions against us 
such actions could seek penalties  injunctive relief and costs of litigation 
fluctuating commodity prices may reduce regulated and nonregulated energy margins 
our regulated energy margins are directly affected by commodity costs related to coal  natural gas  and other fuels used in the electric generation process 
the commodity price of market purchases of electricity and natural gas may also directly affect margins in our regulated electric and natural gas segments 
higher commodity prices increase energy prices and may impact customer demand for energy in the nonregulated market and increase counterparty risk 
this may stress margins at our nonregulated subsidiaries 
integrys energy services may experience increased expenses  including interest costs and uncollectibles  higher working capital requirements  and possibly some reduction in volumes sold as a result of any increase in the cost of fuel or purchased power 
if market prices for electric energy decline below the cost of production at our nonregulated facilities  these units may be temporarily shut down 
actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates 
for more information about these estimates and assumptions  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in this annual report on form k 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
we use derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
in addition  we purchase and sell commodity based contracts in the natural gas and electric energy markets for trading purposes 
in the future  we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
additionally  realized values could differ from values determined by management 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see note  risk management activities 
we may not utilize section k synthetic fuel production tax credits 
we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability for the past several years through tax credits available to us under section k of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal 
we have not fully utilized section k tax credits previously available to us 
our ability to fully utilize the section k tax credits available to us as carryovers in connection with our interest in the production facility will depend on whether the amount of our future federal taxable income and related income tax liability is sufficient to permit the use of such credits 
tax regulations providing for the creation of section k tax credits expired at the end of any future disallowance of some or all of those tax credits as a result of legislative changes or examination of an open year by the irs could materially affect our tax obligations 
at this time  we cannot predict the potential for or the outcome of any irs review 
any change in our ability to sell electricity generated from our nonregulated facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our nonregulated facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates  it may require our nonregulated subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
our revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may receive 
we are subject to provisions that can limit merger and acquisition opportunities for our shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law precludes the acquisition of or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility consumers  investors and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company that is not approved by our board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that such events may be beneficial to their interests 
in addition  the wisconsin business corporation law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult attempts by others to obtain control of our company without the approval of our board of directors

favorable weather conditions at wpsc contributed an approximate million million after tax year over year increase in operating income  however  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage 
fuel and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in  driving a million million after tax negative variance in operating income 
maintenance expense related to wpsc s power plants was higher in compared to  driven by an increase in unplanned outages in as well as the extension of some planned outages 
earnings increased million from to  primarily due to the following fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were more than what was recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact hurricanes had on natural gas prices  contributed an estimated million after tax  year over year increase in earnings 
a pscw ruling  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee nuclear plant outage as well as a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets in  which resulted in an after tax reduction in earnings in of approximately million positive variance compared with earnings 
retail electric rate increases at both wpsc and uppco also had a positive year over year impact on earnings 
unfavorable weather conditions in  compared with  had an estimated million year over year negative after tax impact on electric utility earnings 
natural gas utility operations financial results improved million in over  primarily due to the following financial results for mguc and merc increased million  from a combined net loss of million in  to earnings of million in the positive change in earnings at mguc and merc was driven by the fact that these natural gas utilities operated during the first quarter heating season in  but were not acquired by integrys energy group until after the first quarter heating season 
in addition  mguc and merc incurred a combined million million after tax of transition costs in for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
in  mguc and merc were allocated million million after tax of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
regulated natural gas utility earnings at wpsc increased million  from earnings of million in  to earnings of million in higher earnings were driven by increased volumes due to colder weather conditions during the heating season 
a natural gas rate increase effective january  also contributed to the increase 
the pec natural gas utilities pgl and nsg  which were acquired effective february   recognized a combined net loss of approximately million  primarily related to the seasonal nature of natural gas utilities  which derive earnings during the heating season first and fourth quarters 
because of the late february acquisition date  results for the majority of the two coldest months of the year were not included in natural gas utility earnings in the net income for pgl was less than the level we would normally expect  primarily due to increased costs of providing service 
it is important to note  however  that we received a rate increase at pgl in february  which will help offset rising costs 
please see note  regulatory environment  for more information on the rate increase 
earnings decreased million from to  primarily due to the following mguc and merc acquired on april and july   respectively had a combined net loss of approximately million 
included in the net loss incurred by mguc and merc  was million of after tax external transition costs incurred by these regulated natural gas utilities 
the net loss recognized at mguc and merc in excess of transition costs incurred can be attributed to not owning these operations during the january through march heating season and warmer than normal weather conditions during the last few months of from the acquisition dates through december   actual heating degree days were and below normal for mguc and merc  respectively 
earnings at wpsc s natural gas utility also decreased approximately million  driven by unfavorable weather conditions and customer conservation efforts 
nonregulated energy operations earnings increased million in over  primarily due to the following operating income at integrys energy services increased million million after tax 
after tax income from discontinued operations at integrys energy services increased million  driven by the sale of niagara generation  llc in the first quarter of miscellaneous expense at integrys energy services decreased million million after tax  driven by a decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the period related to integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
minority interest income decreased million million after tax as integrys energy services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and  therefore  did not share in losses from this facility in section k federal tax credits recognized from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility decreased million  from million in  to million in earnings decreased million from to  primarily due to the following an million million after tax increase in interest expense due to higher working capital requirements  primarily related to growth in integrys energy services natural gas operations 
a million million after tax increase in miscellaneous expenses  primarily related to increased tons procured from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility and the fact that integrys energy services received no royalty payments from this investment in a million after tax decrease in income from discontinued operations 
the items negatively impacting earnings discussed above were partially offset by a million million after tax increase in margin including an million pre tax decrease in gains on derivative instruments used to protect the value of section k tax credits 
a million million after tax decrease in operating expenses  primarily related to the recognition of a million pre tax gain on the sale of wps esi gas storage  llc in the second quarter of a million increase in section k federal tax credits recognized from integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
holding company and other operations in  financial results decreased million  from earnings of million in  to a net loss of million in see overview of holding company and other segment operations  for more information

pep was sold in the third quarter of in  pep recognized earnings of million  including million of earnings reported as discontinued operations 
the million loss reported in continuing operations related primarily to intercompany expense allocations to pep salaries  interest expense  etc 
related to employees and debt that remained at integrys energy group after the sale 
the sale of pep resulted in a million after tax gain 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group s common stock from to and an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of integrys energy group s common stock from to integrys energy group issued million shares of common stock on february   in conjunction with the merger with pec  issued million shares of common stock in may in order to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of jp morgan securities  and issued million shares of common stock through a public offering in november additional shares were also issued under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans in   and utility operations in  utility operations included the regulated electric segment  consisting of the regulated electric operations of wpsc and uppco  and the regulated natural gas utility segment  consisting of the natural gas operations of wpsc  pgl  nsg  mguc  and merc

in june  the mpsc issued a final written order to uppco authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase for uppco of million  effective june  see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to the retail electric rate increases at wpsc and uppco 
on a per unit basis  fuel and purchased power costs were approximately higher during the year ended december   compared with the same period in in addition  sales volumes increased  primarily related to an increase in sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers  driven by warmer weather during the cooling season and colder weather during the heating season a portion of heating load is electric in  compared with the increase in sales volumes related to weather was partially offset by an approximate decrease in weather normalized residential and commercial and industrial customer usage  driven by customer conservation resulting from higher energy costs and weaker general economic conditions 
compared with regulated electric revenue increased million  driven by the following approved electric rate increases for wpsc and uppco retail electric customers and rate increases for wpsc s wholesale customers resulting from the formula rate mechanism in place for these customers 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to these rate increases 
electric sales volumes increased  primarily related to a increase in sales volumes to wholesale customers due to higher demand and new wholesale contracts 
unfavorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons for the year ended december   compared with  partially offset the increases discussed above 
margin compared with the regulated electric margin increased million  driven by the following a million increase in the electric utility margin at wpsc 
wpsc s margin was positively impacted by the retail electric rate increases discussed above and by higher electric sales volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers related to weather 
favorable weather conditions during both the heating and cooling seasons positively impacted margin by an estimated million 
the year over year change in wpsc s margin was also positively impacted by a million decrease in the margin related to the accrual of the refund to wholesale customers in of their portion of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in the margin related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in operating and maintenance expenses in and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
no such accrual to wholesale customers occurred in  however  the payment of the refund was made in partially offsetting the increase in wpsc s margin  fuel  and purchased power costs were higher than what was recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were less than what was recovered in rates during the same period in  driving a million negative variance in wpsc s electric margin 
in  fuel and purchased power prices were above what was projected in the rate case primarily due to higher than anticipated commodity costs and the market effects of unplanned plant outages 
on october   a lightning strike hit weston the unit returned to full service on january  the unscheduled outage did not have a significant impact on the electric utility margin as the pscw approved deferral of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly related to the outage 
the outage did  however  cause the price of purchased power from other sources to increase 
excluding the additional purchased power which resulted from the weston outage  fuel and purchased power costs at wpsc increased in  compared with the same period in  primarily related to the higher per unit cost of fuel and purchased power required from the market to serve wpsc s customers 
uppco s margin increased approximately million  primarily due to its retail electric rate increase  effective june  and higher retail sales volumes 
compared with the regulated electric margin decreased million  driven by the following a million decrease in wpsc s electric margin  primarily related to the sale of the kewaunee nuclear generation plant to dominion energy kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
excluding the million increase in fixed payments made to dominion energy kewaunee during the year ended december   wpsc s electric utility margin increased million 
the retail and wholesale electric rate increases discussed above had a favorable impact on wpsc s regulated electric margin 
wpsc s fuel and purchased power costs were less than were recovered in rates during the year ended december   compared with fuel and purchased power costs that were more than were recovered in rates during the same period in the under collection in was primarily due to the impact hurricanes had on natural gas prices  which had an estimated million positive year over year impact on margin 
wpsc s margin was also positively impacted by higher wholesale electric sales volumes  driven by higher demand from existing customers and new wholesale customer contracts 
the increase in wpsc s margin was partially offset by a million decrease in margin related to the refund to retail customers and the accrual for the refund to wholesale customers of a portion of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund 
also  unfavorable weather conditions during the heating and cooling seasons negatively impacted margin by an estimated million uppco s margin increased approximately million primarily due to its first retail electric base rate increase since operating income compared with operating income increased million  driven by the million increase in regulated electric margin discussed above  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc and a combined million increase in depreciation and taxes other than income taxes at the regulated electric utility 
the change in operating and maintenance expense at wpsc was primarily related to the following regulated electric maintenance expenses increased million  driven by longer than anticipated planned outages and a higher number of unplanned outages year over year which included major overhauls planned at the weston and weston generation stations and the de pere energy center  planned major turbine and generator work performed at the pulliam electric generation station  and several unplanned outages at the weston generation station 
regulated electric transmission expenses increased million  primarily related to higher rates charged by miso and atc due to additional transmission investment 
the regulated electric segment of wpsc was allocated external costs to achieve merger synergies of million for the year ended december  amortization in of the regulatory liability recorded for wpsc s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to wholesale electric ratepayers contributed million to the increase in wpsc s operating and maintenance expense 
pursuant to regulatory accounting  the increase in operating and maintenance expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding increase in margin and  therefore  did not have an impact on earnings 
lower pension  post retirement  and other employee benefit costs partially offset the increase in regulated electric operating and maintenance expense at wpsc 
an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utility  while the increase in taxes other than income reflected an increase in sales year over year 
compared with operating income increased million  driven by a million decrease in operating and maintenance expense  and a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by the million decrease in the regulated electric margin 
the change in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following partial amortization of the regulatory liability recorded for wpsc s obligation to refund proceeds received from the liquidation of the kewaunee nonqualified decommissioning trust fund to retail and wholesale electric ratepayers contributed million to the decrease in operating expenses in  compared with pursuant to regulatory accounting  the decrease in operating expense related to this refund was offset by a corresponding decrease in margin 
operating and maintenance expense related to the kewaunee nuclear plant decreased approximately million  driven by the sale of this facility in july the decrease in operating and maintenance expense related to kewaunee did not have a significant impact on income available for common shareholders as wpsc is still purchasing the same amount of power from this facility as it obtained from it when wpsc owned a interest in the plant 
the cost of the power is included as a component of utility cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power 
as a result of the pscw s disallowance of certain costs  wpsc incurred a million charge in related to one half the loss on the sale of kewaunee  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
also  as disallowed by the pscw  wpsc wrote off million in of previously deferred operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  creating a corresponding year over year decrease in operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits also decreased in part due to the sale of kewaunee in partially offsetting the decrease in operating and maintenance expense  software amortization increased million  driven by the late implementation of a new customer billing system 
excluding kewaunee  maintenance expenses at the electric utility segment were up million 
planned maintenance was required on certain combustion turbines  and maintenance expense related to electric distribution assets also increased 
electric transmission expense increased million 
the change in depreciation  amortization and decommissioning expense was primarily related to the following approximately million of decommissioning expense was recorded during  compared with no decommissioning expense recorded in in  realized gains on decommissioning trust assets were substantially offset by decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice see analysis of miscellaneous income below 
a million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the sale of kewaunee in july subsequent to the sale of kewaunee  decommissioning expense is no longer recorded 
an increase in depreciation expense related to continued capital investment at the electric utility partially offset the overall decrease in depreciation and decommissioning expense

an increase in natural gas throughput volumes 
the increase in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by a increase in residential volumes and a increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility 
the increase in sales volumes to residential customers was driven in part by colder year over year weather conditions during the heating season 
the increase in natural gas volumes sold to the electric utility was driven by an increase in the need for the electric utility to run its peaking generation units 
natural gas prices were lower on a per unit basis  compared with  resulting in a decrease in natural gas utility revenue  which partially offset the overall increase in natural gas utility revenue at wpsc 
compared with regulated natural gas utility segment revenue increased million  driven by the following the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in michigan by mguc on april   and the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in minnesota by merc on july  these acquisitions contributed approximately million to natural gas utility revenue and approximately million therms to natural gas throughput volumes in wpsc s natural gas utility revenue was million in  compared with million in lower natural gas revenues at wpsc were primarily related to a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes  primarily related to a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes sold to the electric utility for electric generation and a decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers 
the decrease in throughput volumes to the electric utility resulted from a decrease in the need for the electric utility to run its natural gas fired peaking generation units during the year ended december   compared with  and from higher dispatch of these peaking generation units by miso in for reliability purposes 
the decrease in throughput volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers was also driven by unfavorable weather conditions in compared with  as well as customer conservation efforts 
particularly at the beginning of  customers were taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices in the first half of in  natural gas prices were lower on a per unit basis  compared with  resulting from a large decline in the price of natural gas in the second half of  also contributing to the decrease in natural gas revenue 
partially offsetting the decrease in wpsc s natural gas utility revenue was the natural gas rate increase at wpsc see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to this rate increase 
margin compared with the regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased million  driven by the following the combined margin provided by pgl and nsg in was million 
the combined margin at mguc and merc increased million  from million in  to million in the increase in natural gas margin at mguc and merc was driven primarily by the fact that mguc and merc operated during the first quarter heating season in  but were not acquired by integrys energy group until after the first quarter heating season in wpsc s natural gas margin increased million  from million in  to million in as discussed in more detail above  the increase in wpsc s margin was driven by the retail natural gas rate increase and an increase in throughput volumes to higher margin residential customers due in part to colder year over year weather conditions during the heating season 
the increase in throughput volumes sold to the electric utility did not have a significant impact on wpsc s natural gas utility margin 
compared with the regulated natural gas utility segment margin increased million  driven by the following the combined margin provided by mguc and merc was approximately million 
wpsc s natural gas utility margin decreased million 
as discussed in more detail above  a decrease in throughput volumes to higher margin residential and commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by the natural gas rate increase 
operating income compared with operating income increased million  driven by the million increase in the regulated natural gas utility margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expense  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and a million increase in taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to the following combined operating and maintenance expenses of million were incurred by pgl and nsg in combined operating and maintenance expense at mguc and merc increased approximately million  primarily due to the fact that both of these businesses incurred operating expenses for only a partial year in  compared to incurring a full year of operating and maintenance expenses in for the year ended december   million of combined operating and maintenance expense related to external transition costs  primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
for the year ended december   mguc and merc were allocated million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
operating expenses related to wpsc s natural gas operations increased million year over year  due primarily to the allocation of million of external costs to achieve merger synergies related to the pec merger 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to the merger with pec a combined million of depreciation and amortization expense was recognized at pgl and nsg in and an increase in depreciation expense at merc and mguc these businesses were not included in results of operations for the full year in 
depreciation and amortization expense at wpsc s natural gas utility was relatively flat year over year 
the increase in taxes other than income taxes from to was primarily related to the merger with pec million of taxes other than income taxes were recognized at pgl and nsg in  and the acquisition of the michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations  which were not included in results of operations for the full year in taxes other than income taxes are primarily related to property taxes  real estate taxes  gross receipts taxes  and payroll taxes paid by these companies 
compared with operating income decreased million  driven by a million increase in total operating and maintenance expense  partially offset by the million increase in regulated natural gas utility margin as discussed above 
the increase in operating expenses is explained below 
operating and maintenance expenses increased million 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense at the regulated natural gas utility segment was driven by million of combined operating and maintenance expense incurred by mguc and merc 
of the million of operating and maintenance expense incurred by mguc and merc during the year ended december   million related to external transition expenses  primarily for the start up of outsourcing activities and other legal and consulting fees 
partially offsetting the increase in operating and maintenance expenses related to mguc and merc  operating expenses related to wpsc s natural gas operations decreased  driven by decreases in various employee benefit related expenses 
the million year over year increase in depreciation expense recorded at the regulated natural gas utility segment was driven by a combined million of depreciation expense recorded by mguc and merc for the year ended december  continued capital investment at wpsc s natural gas utility also contributed to the increase in depreciation expense 
the million increase in taxes other than income taxes was driven by million of taxes other than income taxes recorded by mguc and merc  primarily related to property taxes 
integrys energy services operations integrys energy services is a diversified nonregulated energy supply and services company serving residential  commercial  industrial and wholesale customers in developed competitive markets in the united states and canada

revenue compared with year over year  revenues increased approximately billion 
the increase was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of the addition of the nonregulated energy operations of pec and an average increase in electric prices of over 
in addition to revenue and volume contributions from the merger with pec  retail electric sales volumes and related revenue increased as a result of integrys energy services new retail electric product offerings to existing markets and expansion into new retail electric markets 
wholesale electric sales volumes and revenue increased as a result of the additional wholesale origination structured transactions 
wholesale natural gas volumes increased as a result of an increase in the profitability of wholesale origination structured natural gas transactions throughout and into some of these transactions were entered into in prior periods for future delivery  therefore  integrys energy services is seeing an increase in volumes in the periods in which these transactions settle 
retail natural gas volumes also increased  driven by favorable pricing compared with  which encouraged new and existing customers to enter into or extend supply contracts with integrys energy services 
compared with year over year  revenues decreased million  primarily related to a decrease in both physical retail and wholesale electric sales volumes and a decrease in energy prices during the latter half of the decrease in physical retail electric sales volumes was driven by a decrease in retail electric sales volumes in ohio as aggregation sales in ohio ended on december   with the expiration of integrys energy services contracts with ohio aggregation customers 
michigan retail electric sales volumes also decreased as many customers returned to their utility supplier beginning in and continuing into as a result of high wholesale energy prices and utility tariff changes  which significantly lowered the savings that customers could obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
in other areas  lower wholesale energy prices in the latter half of allowed integrys energy services to sign up a significant number of new retail customers 
the decrease in physically settled wholesale electric sales volumes was driven by a trend toward more financially settled transactions in  compared to margins integrys energy services margin increased million from to and increased million from to the table below provides a summary of the significant items contributing to the change in margin 
other significant items in the table below are generally related to the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions and the settlement of the derivative instruments used to protect the value of section k tax credits

the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services electric and other margins 
realized gains on structured origination contracts realized gains on structured origination contracts increased million  from million in to million in origination contracts are physical  customer based agreements with municipalities  merchant generators  cooperatives  municipalities  and regulated utilities 
the increase was primarily due to continued growth in existing markets in the midwest and northeastern united states  as well as expansion into the markets in the western united states 
realized gains on structured origination contracts increased million from to the increase was primarily due to realized gains from origination contracts involving the sale of energy through structured transactions to wholesale customers in the midwest and northeastern united states 
these origination contracts were not in place in integrys energy services provided products to large origination customers desiring to take advantage of falling energy prices 
realized retail electric margin the realized retail electric margin increased million from million in to million in the change was primarily due to the following a million increase related to operations in illinois  driven by the merger with pec s nonregulated business and the addition of new customers due to the expiration of certain regulatory provisions in the state in that effectively opened the market to nonregulated energy suppliers 
a million increase related to operations in texas  as a result of further penetration into this market resulting from continued marketing efforts 
retail offerings in texas first began in the third quarter of a million increase related to operations in new england as new customers were added due to an increased sales focus in this region 
partially offsetting the increases discussed above were a million decrease related to michigan operations as many customers continued to return to utility suppliers as a result of high wholesale energy prices and changes in utility tariffs which have continued to make the michigan energy market less competitive 
a million decrease related to operations in the state of new york  related to a change in the product mix offered to customers in response to utility rate structure changes 
the realized retail electric margin decreased million from to the decrease was primarily driven by an million decrease in margin in ohio and a million decrease in margin in northern maine 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in margin in michigan  a million increase in margin in new york  and positive margin contributions from retail electric operations in texas and illinois 
integrys energy services retail electric aggregation sales in ohio ended on december   with the expiration of integrys energy services contracts with ohio aggregation customers 
the decrease in margin from operations in northern maine was driven by higher supply costs in part tied to diesel fuel prices 
a portion of the electricity purchased by integrys energy services to supply customers in northern maine is derived from burning wood chips 
the cost to transport wood chips  as well as the operating costs of the machine utilized to make the wood chips  were negatively impacted by higher diesel fuel prices 
in  integrys energy services shared in this diesel fuel exposure with the generation supplier 
the increase in margin from retail electric operations in michigan was driven by the elimination of the seams elimination charge adjustment seca effective march  see note  regulatory environment  for more information related to seca 
integrys energy services began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market in and started to deliver power to these customers in july in  integrys energy services began offering retail electric products to large commercial and industrial customers in illinois 
in  integrys energy services was only offering natural gas products and energy management services to customers in illinois 
all other wholesale electric operations as part of its trading activities  integrys energy services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts in established wholesale markets where integrys energy services has market expertise  under risk management policies set by management and approved by integrys energy group s board of directors 
integrys energy services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts 
period by period variability in the margin contributed by integrys energy services optimization strategies and trading activities is expected due to changing market conditions and differences in the timing of gains and losses recognized on derivative and non derivative contracts  as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
a diverse mix of products and markets  combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies  has allowed integrys energy services to generate economic value and earnings from these activities while staying within the value at risk var limits authorized by integrys energy group s board of directors 
for more information on var  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
integrys energy services margin from all other wholesale electric operations increased million from to  driven by an increase in net realized and unrealized gains primarily unrealized gains related to trading activities utilized to optimize the value of integrys energy services merchant generation fleet and energy contract portfolios 
partially offsetting the increase resulting from realized and unrealized gains  the overall level of proprietary trading was less in  due primarily to a decrease in electric price volatility during the first three quarters of  increased emphasis on structured electric transactions in  and the departure of several key traders in the third quarter of proprietary trading started picking up again in the fourth quarter of as electric price volatility increased 
integrys energy services used the departure of several of its traders as an opportunity to restructure trading operations into two groups 
its east trading group was relocated from washington dc to chicago and the west trading group is located in denver 
the restructured trading operations allow integrys energy services to more effectively service customers in the west by providing better diversification of trading talent  market expertise  and product offerings 
integrys energy services margin from all other wholesale electric operations increased million from to  driven by an increase in net realized and unrealized gains related to trading activities utilized to optimize the value of integrys energy services merchant generation fleet and energy contract portfolios 
oil option activity oil option activity drove a million increase in electric and other margins from to the oil options were utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits from to however  companies are no longer allowed to generate tax credits from the production of synthetic fuel as this program ended effective december  therefore  integrys energy services exercised substantially all of its remaining oil options in net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of million were recognized in  compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of million in these derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value were recorded in earnings 
the increase in the fair value of these instruments in over reflects increased oil prices 
oil option activity drove an million decrease in electric and other margins from to the decrease was driven by a decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized to protect the value of a portion of integrys energy services section k federal tax credits from to this decrease is a result of net mark to market and realized losses on oil options of million in  compared with net mark to market and realized gains on oil options of million in retail mark to market activity earnings volatility from this activity results from the application of derivative accounting rules to customer supply contracts requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market  without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the customer sales contracts  which are not considered derivative instruments 
these mark to market gains and losses will vary each period  and ultimately reverse as the related customer sales contracts settle 
as a result  integrys energy services generally experiences mark to market losses on supply contracts in periods of declining wholesale prices and mark to market gains in periods of increasing wholesale prices 
results from retail mark to market activity increased million from million of unrealized losses in to million of unrealized gains in results from retail mark to market activity decreased million from to liquidation of electric supply contract in the fourth quarter of  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine requested that integrys energy services liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and at that time  integrys energy services recognized an million gain related to the liquidation of the contract and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract was more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
the liquidation and subsequent replacement of this contract resulted in the following a million increase in margins from to the replacement contract increased the cost of purchased power needed to serve customers in maine by million in  compared with million in a million negative impact on the electric and other margin  as a result of higher purchased power costs recorded under the new contract of million compared with an million gain recognized on the liquidation of the original contract in natural gas margins integrys energy services natural gas margins increased million from to and increased million from to the natural gas margins included the negative impact of million of amortization related to purchase accounting adjustments required as a result of the merger with pec 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in integrys energy services natural gas margins 
realized natural gas margins realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in the majority of this increase  million  was driven by margin contributed by the nonregulated retail natural gas marketing operations of pec and improved supply optimization  as integrys energy services was able to secure lower supply costs for firm sales commitments to retail natural gas customers in ohio and illinois 
the remaining increase in realized natural gas margins was driven by the nonregulated wholesale natural gas marketing operations added with the pec merger 
realized natural gas margins increased million  from million in  to million in the majority of this increase  million  related to an increase in retail natural gas margin  driven by continued expansion of integrys energy services canadian retail operations including higher sales volumes to existing customers as well as new customer additions 
margins from retail natural gas operations in wisconsin  michigan  and illinois also increased  as integrys energy services was able to better manage supply to these customers  aided by favorable market conditions 
the remaining million increase in realized natural gas margins related to wholesale operations  driven by an increase in structured wholesale natural gas transactions attributed to an increase in the volatility of the price of natural gas as well as high natural gas storage spreads during most of mass market supply options options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers are used to reduce the risk of price movements  customer migration  and changes in consumer consumption patterns 
earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the options requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market  without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the customer contracts 
full requirements natural gas contracts with integrys energy services customers are not considered derivatives and  therefore  no gain or loss is recognized on these contracts until settlement 
the option mark to market gains and losses will reverse as the related customer sales contracts settle 
in  options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers drove a million increase in integrys energy services natural gas margin 
these options had a million positive impact on margin in commensurate with higher natural gas prices  compared with a negative million impact on margin in commensurate with declining natural gas prices 
in  options utilized to manage supply costs for mass market customers drove an million decrease in integrys energy services natural gas margin 
these options had a million negative impact on integrys energy services natural gas margin in commensurate with declining natural gas prices  compared with a million positive impact on margin in commensurate with higher natural gas prices in the latter half of 
spot to forward differential integrys energy services experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
integrys energy services policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with contracts in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  integrys energy services experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
the natural gas storage cycle had a negative million impact on natural gas margins from to there was no material impact on margin as a result of the natural gas storage cycle in compared with a million positive impact in at december   the market value of natural gas in storage was million less than the market value of future sales contracts net unrealized loss  related to the natural gas storage cycle 
this million difference is expected to vary with market conditions  and will reverse entirely and have a positive impact on earnings when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage 
the natural gas storage cycle had a positive million impact on natural gas margins from to in  the natural gas storage cycle had a positive million impact on margin  compared with a million negative impact on margin in other mark to market activity other mark to market activity primarily relates to changes in the fair market value of basis swaps utilized to mitigate market price risk associated with natural gas transportation contracts and certain natural gas sales contracts as well as contracts utilized to mitigate market price risk related to certain natural gas storage contracts 
earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the basis and other swaps requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market  without a corresponding mark to market offset related to the physical natural gas transportation contracts  the natural gas sales contracts  or the natural gas storage contracts as these contracts are not considered derivative instruments 
therefore  no gain or loss is recognized on the transportation contracts  customer sales contracts  or natural gas storage contracts until physical settlement of these contracts occurs 
derivative instruments not previously discussed drove a million increase in the natural gas margins as mark to market gains on these instruments increased to million in derivative instruments not previously discussed drove a increase in the natural gas margins as mark to market gains on these instruments increased in  compared with operating income compared with operating income at integrys energy services increased million  driven by the million increase in margin discussed above  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expense and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by higher payroll and benefit costs related to additional employees required as a result of continued business expansion activities at integrys energy services the most significant of which related to the merger of pec s nonregulated operation into integrys energy services 
a million pre tax gain on the sale of wps esi gas storage  llc  million of costs to achieve merger synergies and additional costs related to plant outages of million in also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expense 
compared with operating income at integrys energy services increased million  driven by the million increase in margin discussed above and a million decrease in operating and maintenance expense 
the decrease in operating and maintenance expense was primarily related to a million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of wps esi gas storage  llc in the second quarter of this gain was partially offset by higher payroll and benefit costs related to an increase in the number of employees as a result of business expansion activities 
holding company and other segment operations compared with financial results at the holding company and other segment decreased million  from net income of million for the year ended december   to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the change was driven by the following a million million after tax increase in interest expense  driven by additional borrowings assumed in the merger with pec  as well as an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  higher working capital requirements at integrys energy services  and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with pec 
a million million after tax gain on the sale of integrys energy group s one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc in april also contributed to the decrease in year over year earnings 
an million increase in pre tax earnings million after tax from integrys energy group s ownership interest in atc 
integrys energy group recorded million of pre tax equity earnings from atc during the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in a million million after tax decrease in operating and maintenance expenses  primarily related to the reallocation of external costs to achieve merger synergies associated with the pec merger  incurred from july through march in march  all external costs to achieve were reallocated from the holding company and other segment where they were initially recorded to other reportable segments  which will ultimately be the beneficiaries of the synergy savings resulting from the costs to achieve 
compared with earnings at the holding company and other segment decreased million  from net income of million for the year ended december   to a net income of million for the year ended december  the changes were driven by the following a million increase in interest expense  net of intercompany interest income million after taxes higher interest expense was driven by an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisition of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota and working capital requirements at integrys energy services 
a million increase in operating and maintenance expense million after taxes 
the increase in operating and maintenance expense was driven by legal and consulting expenses related to business expansion activities  primarily attributed to the merger with pec

a million decrease in pre tax losses recognized for the year related to integrys energy services investment in a synthetic fuel facility 
integrys energy services took less production from this facility in compared with a million increase in foreign currency gains at integrys energy services canadian subsidiaries  which was offset by related losses in gross margin 
these transactions are substantially hedged from an economic perspective  resulting in no significant impact on income loss available for common shareholders 
an increase of million  partially due to an increase in interest income recognized related to the transmission facilities wpsc is funding on atc s behalf pending the start up of weston a decrease due to the million pre tax gain recognized from the sale of integrys energy group s one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc in the second quarter of compared with miscellaneous income decreased million driven primarily by approximately million of realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust assets recorded during the year ended december  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to these realized gains was offset by a corresponding increase in decommissioning expense in integrys energy services equity investment in a synthetic fuel facility contributed an additional million decrease in miscellaneous income  driven in part by additional synthetic fuel production procured in from our partners in this facility 
pre tax gains recognized on land sales decreased million  from million in to million in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in pre tax equity earnings from atc and a million pre tax gain recognized from the sale of integrys energy group s one third interest in guardian pipeline  llc 
interest expense compared with interest expense increased million as a result of interest expense of million recorded at pgl and nsg from february  through december  the remaining increase in interest expense was driven by an increase in short term and long term borrowings required to fund the acquisitions of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  higher working capital requirements at integrys energy services  and transaction and transition costs related to the merger with pec 
compared with interest expense increased million due primarily to an increase in the average amount of both short term and long term debt outstanding and higher average short term interest rates 
during  borrowings were primarily utilized to fund the purchase of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  the construction of weston  and for working capital requirements at integrys energy services 
minority interest compared with a decrease of million in minority interest related to integrys energy services synthetic fuel operations 
in  integrys energy services partner elected to stop receiving production from the synthetic fuel facility and  therefore  did not share in losses from this facility 
compared with minority interest related to integrys energy services synthetic fuel operation did not significantly change for the year ended december  compared to the same period in provision for income taxes year ended december  effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized in compared with the decrease in section k federal tax credits recognized was driven by the impact of high oil prices on our ability to realize the benefit of section k federal tax credits 
section k federal tax credits recognized from the production and sale of synthetic fuel were million in  compared with million in the increase in the effective tax rate was driven by a higher effective state tax rate  primarily related to the acquisition of regulated natural gas operations in minnesota and also due to a loss in value of various state net operating loss carryforwards 
section k federal tax credits from the production and sale of synthetic fuel increased million to million in  to partially offset the increase in effective tax rate 
discontinued operations  net of tax compared with income from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million  from after tax income of million in to after tax income of million in in september  integrys energy group completed the sale of pep for approximately million 
post closing adjustments in the amount of million were settled in february related to this sale  which reduced the sale price to million 
these post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at december  during the year ended december   million of income from discontinued operations was recognized related to pep  which included an after tax gain of million on the sale 
discontinued operations  net of tax  related to wps niagara generation  llc niagara  which was sold in january  increased million  from income of million in to income of million in the increase in income generated from niagara was mostly due to a million after tax gain on the sale of the facility

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies when companies are required to recognize conditional legal asset retirement obligations that result from the acquisition  construction  and normal operation of a long lived asset 
because the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations had been interpreted differently between companies  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  had been inconsistently applied in practice 
the adoption of interpretation no 
at integrys energy services on december   resulted in a negative million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  related to recording a liability for asbestos remediation at certain of integrys energy services generation plants 
for the utility segments of integrys energy group  we concluded it was probable that any differences between expenses under interpretation no 
and expenses currently recovered through customer rates will be recoverable in future customer rates 
accordingly  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the utility segment s income 
balance sheet net accounts receivable increased million  from  million at december   to  million at december   primarily due to the following at december   pgl and nsg had a net accounts receivable balance of million 
net accounts receivable at integrys energy services increased million  driven primarily by the integration of pec s nonregulated business into integrys energy services  as well as continued growth in integrys energy services business in net accounts receivable at wpsc increased million  primarily due to an million receivable from atc pertaining to transmission facilities required to support weston that wpsc is funding on their behalf pending completion of weston at december   the amount owed to wpsc by atc was million and was included as a component of other long term assets 
at december   the million was reflected as a receivable from atc as was the million of incremental funding that was incurred in accrued unbilled revenues increased million  from million at december   to million at december   primarily driven by combined accrued unbilled revenues of million at pgl and nsg at december  accrued unbilled revenues at integrys energy services also increased million  driven by the integration of pec s nonregulated business into integrys energy services  as well as continued growth in integrys energy services business in inventories increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the inventory balance at integrys energy services increased million  due to the addition of pec s nonregulated business as well as an increase in storage volumes related to continued growth of integrys energy services natural gas business in new and existing markets 
the inventory balance at pgl and nsg was million at december  at december   compared to december   total assets from risk management activities decreased million and total liabilities from risk management activities decreased million 
the decrease in assets and liabilities from risk management activities was driven by timing of mark to market gain and loss recognition on the underlying contracts 
although total risk management assets and liabilities decreased  long term risk management assets and liabilities increased at december   compared to december  this increase related to more emphasis on structured origination contracts  which are physical  customer based agreements with municipalities  merchant generators  and regulated utilities  and are generally longer term in nature 
total regulatory assets increased million  from million at december   to  million at december   primarily attributed to a million increase in the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs and a million increase in the regulatory asset for pension and post retirement benefit related items 
the increase in the environmental related regulatory asset related to estimated costs of future natural gas remediation for several manufactured gas plant sites at pgl and nsg

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
currently  we believe our ratings are among the best in the energy industry see financing cash flows credit ratings below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a million decrease in working capital requirements year over year 
it is important to note that changes in working capital balances at february   as a result of the pec merger are not incorporated in the consolidated statement of cash flows  as the merger was a noncash transaction 
only pec changes in working capital from the merger date to december  are included 
inventory levels at integrys energy services increased from december  to december   but this change was less than the increase from december  to december   driving the majority of the decrease in working capital requirements 
integrys energy services continued to see growth in its natural gas business in both new and existing markets 
the year over year change in natural gas inventories at the regulated utilities was not significant 
the remaining increase in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by a year over year increase in income available for common shareholders 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was driven by an million increase in cash required to fund working capital requirements  primarily due to an increase in natural gas inventories at integrys energy services 
natural gas in storage at integrys energy services increased million primarily related to a increase in natural gas volumes in storage at december   compared to december  partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of inventory in storage 
integrys energy services chose to purchase more natural gas for storage due to high natural gas storage spreads future natural gas sales prices were higher than the near term price of natural gas

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in december  standard poor s and moody s withdrew the ratings assigned to pec s commercial paper at the request of integrys energy group 
on november   standard poor s revised the outlook on integrys energy group and all of its subsidiaries to stable from negative 
standard poor s outlook had been negative since february  for all integrys energy group companies  as discussed below 
the revised outlook reflects integrys energy group s progress to improve its financial position and business profiles since its one notch downgrade on february  on november   standard poor s also reaffirmed its a rating on wpsc s senior secured debt 
on september   standard poor s raised the senior secured debt for nsg one notch from a to a 
the new rating was the result of a review and changes made to the collateral coverage requirements standard and poor s uses when assigning recovery ratings to united states utility first mortgage bonds 
on february   standard poor s lowered the corporate credit rating on integrys energy group to a from a and removed it from creditwatch with negative implications 
standard poor s also lowered integrys energy group s unsecured ratings to bbb from a and all other issue specific ratings by one notch 
standard poor s stated that the ratings actions were due to concerns related to plans to expand its energy marketing business  the dividend requirements resulting from the pec merger  moderate capital expenditure requirements  lower than expected performance at mguc and merc  uncertainty regarding future rate relief  and full integration of the newly acquired pec utilities 
at the same time  standard poor s lowered all wpsc s issue specific ratings by one notch as they stated wpsc s liquidity is being pressured by its ongoing construction program 
standard poor s affirmed all pec  pgl  and nsg ratings 
standard poor s outlook for all integrys energy group related companies was negative pending successful integration of recent acquisitions 
on february   moody s downgraded the senior unsecured rating of integrys energy group to a from a  the bank credit facility to a from a  the commercial paper rating to prime from prime  and the junior subordinated notes to baa from a moody s also downgraded wpsc s senior secured rating to aa from aa  its senior unsecured bank credit facility to a from aa  and its preferred stock to a from a and confirmed wpsc s commercial paper rating at prime at the same time  moody s affirmed the ratings of pgl and nsg 
moody s actions to downgrade were due to concerns about increases in integrys energy group s consolidated debt levels and business risk profile evidenced by the increased scale and scope of the post merger non regulated energy marketing business plus the entry into the historically more challenging regulatory jurisdiction of illinois 
moody s outlook for all integrys energy group related companies is stable 
on february   moody s also upgraded the senior unsecured rating of pec to a from baa  conforming it with those of integrys energy group  and affirmed all other ratings for pec 
moody s actions to upgrade the senior unsecured rating were due to the expected business risk improvement from the merger with integrys energy group  which resulted in the sale of pep and transferred pec s energy and marketing business to integrys energy services  leaving pec holding only the two regulated subsidiaries  pgl and nsg 
in addition  the upgrade reflects integrys energy group s guaranty of the million of pec notes due in discontinued operations net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in and million in the increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations was driven by approximately million of proceeds received from the sale of pep in the third quarter of post closing adjustments in the amount of million were settled in february related to this sale  which reduced the sale price to million 
these post closing adjustments were funded through other current liabilities at december  and  therefore  are included in note d  cash and cash equivalents  as a non cash transaction 
net cash provided by discontinued operations was million in and million in the increase in cash provided by discontinued operations in was driven by a decrease in cash paid for emission allowances required to operate sunbury in  compared with substantially all of the emission allowances required to operate sunbury through the sale were purchased in  and by the million of proceeds received from the sale of sunbury in these increases were partially offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances in which was partially offset by income taxes paid related to the gain on the sale of these emission allowances

regulatory matters and rate trends to mitigate the volatility of electric fuel generation and purchased power costs in and beyond  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its pscw approved risk plan and policy  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
in wpsc s retail electric rate case proceeding for  the pscw applied a financial harm test when considering the rate recovery of certain costs previously authorized for deferred accounting treatment 
the pscw has not applied a financial harm test previously when considering the rate recovery of costs that were previously authorized for deferral 
in wpsc s rate case proceeding for  after applying the financial harm test  the pscw disallowed rate recovery of the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of of the pre tax loss realized on the sale of kewaunee 
none of these disallowed costs were found to be imprudent by the pscw 
notwithstanding the pscw s decision on these kewaunee related deferred costs  wpsc still believes it is probable that all regulatory assets recorded at december   will be collected from ratepayers 
forecasting and monitoring of fuel costs have become extremely difficult for both the pscw and wpsc 
these challenges can be attributed to the implementation of the miso day market and volatility in natural gas prices 
in  the pscw received several applications from various wisconsin electric utilities under the pscw chapter fuel rules for large rate increases due to increased natural gas prices 
in response  on february   the pscw opened docket ac to review the fuel rules 
on february   the five utilities subject to the current fuel rules filed proposed changes to the fuel rules with the pscw 
the primary proposed change was to replace the trigger mechanism with a true dead band of  which would limit a utility s annual exposure or opportunity to a maximum of of fuel costs 
on may   the pscw directed staff to prepare a draft rule revision to pscw chapter fuel rules incorporating many of the components of the utilities proposal  with a bandwidth as opposed to the bandwidth recommended by the utilities 
the pscw staff circulated a draft rule to that effect and the parties have commented on the draft rule 
the draft rule is currently awaiting pscw action

midwest independent transmission system operator wpsc  uppco  and integrys energy services are members of the miso  which operates a financial and physical electric wholesale market in the midwest 
the market pricing is based on a locational marginal pricing system 
miso participants offer their generation and bid their customer load into the market on an hourly basis and on a day ahead basis 
this results in net receipts from  or net obligations to  miso for each hour of each day 
miso aggregates these hourly transactions and provides bi weekly settlement statements 
these disputable settlements have an adjustment period based on the subsequent data which may require billing adjustments resulting in increases or decreases to the net miso receipt or obligation 
for wpsc and uppco  it is anticipated that the billing adjustments will be recovered through the state rate recovery process

market price risk management activities market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of integrys energy services  along with oil options used to mitigate the risk of an increase in oil prices 
integrys energy services marketing and trading operations manage electricity and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
derivative instruments are utilized in these operations 
integrys energy services measures the fair value of derivative instruments on a mark to market basis 
the fair value is included in assets or liabilities from risk management activities on integrys energy group s consolidated balance sheet  with an offsetting entry to other comprehensive income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges or to earnings 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of integrys energy services assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended december  integrys energy services mark to market roll forward millions oil options natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at december  plus contracts assumed in the merger with pec less contracts realized or settled during period plus changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december  fair value of contracts at december  reflects the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
includes the value of contracts in existence at december   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december   along with the amortization of contracts originally accounted for as derivatives and later designated as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
includes unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at december   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to december   which are included in integrys energy services portfolio at december   as well as gains and losses at the inception of contracts when a liquid market exists 
there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts generally for contracts with a duration of less than five years 
the table below shows the sources of fair value and maturities of integrys energy services risk management instruments 
integrys energy services risk management contract aging at fair value as of december  millions source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value includes exchange traded contracts such as nymex and ice contracts and basis swaps 
includes electric and natural gas contract positions for which pricing information  used by integrys energy services to calculate fair value  is obtained primarily through broker quotes and other publicly available sources 
critical accounting policies integrys energy group has identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
integrys energy group s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities integrys energy group has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities 
the utilities defer the effects of mark to market accounting for most energy related derivatives as regulatory assets or liabilities  pursuant to sfas no 
in addition  integrys energy group may apply the normal purchases and sales exception  provided by sfas no 
 as amended  to certain derivative contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when integrys energy group enters contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when integrys energy group holds assets or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets of integrys energy group 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine a contract s fair value 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models using external information wherever possible 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by integrys energy group s management 
like most commodity markets  after some length of time  markets for natural gas and power become relatively illiquid  making it difficult to obtain reliable price information 
as a component of the fair value determination  integrys energy group considers the requirements to service certain of its contracts as well as counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk 
this component of the fair value determination is especially subjective because limited liquid market information is available 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements  beginning january   integrys energy services will no longer include transaction costs in these fair value determinations 
see note v  new accounting pronouncements  for more information on this topic 
the effect of changing the underlying assumptions for this component of fair value at december   is as follows change in component effect on fair value of net risk management assets at december  millions increase decrease decrease increase these potential changes in fair value would be included in current and long term liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of nonregulated revenue on the consolidated statements of income  unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity 
purchase accounting the merger with pec in  as well as the acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota in  were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this statement  the purchase price paid by the acquirer  including transaction costs  is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date based on their fair values 
the per share fair value of the common stock issued by integrys energy group for the acquisition of pec was determined by using the average market value of integrys energy group s common stock over a five day period  beginning two days before the announcement date of the merger 
as integrys energy group announced its intent to sell pep at the time of the closing of the merger  the pep assets and liabilities were reported at estimated fair value less costs to sell 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
assumptions may be incomplete  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
as discussed below within asset impairment  a significant amount of goodwill resulted from these acquisitions  which requires impairment testing on at least an annual basis 
in conjunction with the pec merger  the most significant fair value adjustments related to nonderivative commodity contracts and customer relationships  which were recorded as intangible assets at integrys energy services 
the intangible asset related to the contracts is being amortized into earnings as the contracts settle  and the intangible asset related to customer relationships is being amortized over the estimated lives of those relationships 
the amortization of these items had a negative impact on earnings in pgl  nsg  mguc  and merc are predominantly regulated utilities  therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the fair value of the majority of their assets and liabilities did not change significantly as a result of applying purchase accounting 
environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas operations integrys energy group s utility subsidiaries  their predecessors  and certain former affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas manufactured gas sites 
the utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs they incur in connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas sites pending recovery through rates or from other entities 
the amounts deferred include costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and management s best estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites 
management s estimates are based upon a probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative and remedial costs 
integrys energy group considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs  and the extent of recovery from other potential responsible parties 
see note  commitments and contingencies for further discussion of environmental matters 
asset impairment integrys energy group annually reviews its assets for impairment 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  form the basis for these analyses 
wpsc recorded goodwill of million in its natural gas utility segment resulting from the wisconsin fuel and light acquisition in in  integrys energy group recorded million of goodwill in conjunction with the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota 
in  million of goodwill attributable to the pec merger was recorded 
the goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances warrant based on the guidance of sfas no 
the test for impairment includes estimating the fair market value of each reporting unit using assumptions about future profitability of the reporting units 
a significant decrease in market values and or projected future cash flows could result in an impairment loss 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to integrys energy services than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to rate setting based on cost of service that is available to our regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of integrys energy services property  plant  and equipment totaled million 
integrys energy group believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  capital expenditures  and generation volumes and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
management s assumptions about future electricity and capacity prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at integrys energy services in the impairment analyses are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
integrys energy services forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in sfas no 
integrys energy services evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value or fair value less costs to sell if held for sale 
throughout  integrys energy services tested various power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
no impairment charges were recorded in as a result of the recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future results given the nature of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
changes in actual results or assumptions could result in an impairment 
receivables and reserves our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and integrys energy services accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
at december  and  integrys energy group s unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates are recorded in revenue in the next period 
differences historically have not been significant 
integrys energy services  uppco  merc  mguc  pgl  and nsg record reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
wpsc  however  records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve 
the reserve is most critical to pgl because their accounts receivables have higher credit risk and are sensitive to the price of natural gas  and to integrys energy services because their receivables comprise the majority of the total 
pgl s reserve for uncollectible accounts reflects its best estimates of probable losses on the accounts receivable balances 
the reserve is based on known troubled accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
provisions for bad debt expense are affected by changes in various factors  including the impacts of natural gas prices and weather 
each quarter  pgl evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible accounts based on the most current available information and adjusts the reserve for changes in estimated probable accounts receivable losses 
integrys energy services calculates the reserve for potential uncollectible customer receivable balances by applying an estimated bad debt experience rate to each past due aging category and reserving for of specific customer receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible 
the basis for calculating the reserve for receivables from wholesale counterparties considers netting agreements  collateral  and guarantees 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and pension and other postretirement benefit costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
integrys energy group s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only

integrys energy group considers bonds  rated by moody s as aa or better  when determining the discount rate at the measurement date 
regression analysis is applied to construct a best fit curve that makes coupon yields to maturity a function of time to maturity 
the pension or retiree medical cash flows are then matched to the appropriate spot rates and discounted back to the measurement date 
to select an assumed long term rate of return on qualified plan assets  the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class are considered  as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in   and for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets are recognized for purposes of calculating benefit cost over a five year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered 
more information on health care cost trend rates can be found in note  employee benefit plans 
for a table showing future payments that integrys energy group expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans 
regulatory accounting the electric and natural gas utility segments of integrys energy group follow sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral of these items as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we amortize the regulatory assets and liabilities into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
if our regulated electric and natural gas utility segments would no longer meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of sfas no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all of integrys energy group s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in the income statement 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret them differently 
as of january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas as allowed under interpretation no 
 integrys energy group elected to change its method of accounting to record interest and penalties paid on income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and technical interpretations of applicable tax law and regulation across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on integrys energy group s financial condition and results of operations 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
for our regulated operations  to the extent we are not recovering the effects of inflation  we will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
however  any increase from inflation is offset with projected business growth 
therefore  the estimated effect of inflation on our nonregulated businesses is minor

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks integrys energy group has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  equity return risk  and principal preservation risk 
integrys energy group is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries business and the environment in which we operate 
integrys energy group has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk utilities the electric utilities of integrys energy group purchase natural gas and coal for use in power generation 
they also purchase power on the miso market at a price that is often reflective of the underlying cost of natural gas used in power generation 
as a result  the electric utilities are subject to commodity price risk  which they manage in a number of ways  the primary method being fuel recovery mechanisms reflected in the rates charged to customers 
prudent fuel and purchased power costs are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco and by the michigan retail electric operations and wholesale electric operations of wpsc 
the costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utility subsidiaries are generally also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wpsc s wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations  but annual rate cases have mitigated the year to year price risk 
for intra year price risk  a fuel window mechanism is used to recover costs resulting from significant price volatility 
under the fuel window  if actual fuel and purchased power costs deviate by more than the range for and  a rate review can be triggered 
once a rate review is triggered  rates may be reset subject to pscw approval for the remainder of the year to recover  on an annualized basis  the projected increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
for  under the order approving the pec merger  wpsc was allowed to adjust wisconsin retail electric rates effective january   subject to the fuel window  to take into account the impact of natural gas prices on purchased power costs  as well as changes in the price of coal  rail costs to ship the coal  and natural gas used for fuel 
however  for  wpsc was not allowed to adjust retail electric rates for other changes 
to manage commodity price risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operation of wpsc and the natural gas operations of wpsc  pgl  nsg  and merc are employing risk management techniques pursuant to the risk policies approved by their respective regulators  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures and options 
nonregulated subsidiary as part of its trading activities  integrys energy services seeks to generate profits from the volatility of the price of electricity by purchasing or selling various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts in established wholesale markets where integrys energy services has market expertise  under risk management policies set by management and approved by integrys energy group s board of directors 
integrys energy services also seeks to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its generation and customer contract portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts  options  financial transmission rights  and capacity contracts 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy group employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
integrys energy services var calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio primarily natural gas and power positions  which includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet  but excludes the long dated positions created by the merchant generating fleet and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  and other ancillary fuels 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
in addition to var  integrys energy services employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations and stress testing 
in conjunction with the var analysis  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for integrys energy services risk exposure 
integrys energy services var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
integrys energy services var calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage  to the extent such positions are significant 
the var for integrys energy services trading portfolio is presented in the following table millions confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed december average for twelve months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
interest rate risk integrys energy group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from its variable rate long term debt and short term borrowings 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
integrys energy group enters into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
integrys energy group may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
due to decreases in short term commercial paper borrowings in the last year  integrys energy group has decreased its exposure to variable interest rates 
based on the variable rate debt of integrys energy group outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate integrys energy group s exposure to the change 
equity return and principal preservation risk integrys energy group currently funds liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
integrys energy group maintains qualified pension plans for employees retirement 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for the plan and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits could also impact future contributions 
integrys energy group monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to integrys energy group s regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures
