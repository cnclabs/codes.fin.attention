item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states  based on revenues 
we operate a nationwide portfolio of radio stations in markets based upon completion of pending acquisitions and dispositions  including san francisco  boston  seattle  denver  sacramento  portland  indianapolis  kansas city  milwaukee  austin  norfolk  buffalo  new orleans  memphis  providence  greensboro  greenville spartanburg  rochester  madison  wichita  wilkes barre scranton  springfield and gainesville ocala 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from sales on our stations websites  network compensation  promotional activities and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues  and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and associated uncertainties 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations for the relevant periods i include net revenues and station operating expenses from stations we own  ii include net revenues and station operating expenses generated by stations that we operate pursuant to time brokerage agreements tba prior to acquiring the stations  and iii exclude net revenues and station operating expenses generated by stations that we own or will acquire  but that third parties operate pursuant to tbas pending disposition to such third parties under the heading same station considerations  we evaluate net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
we use these comparisons to assess the effect of acquisitions and dispositions of stations on our operations throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on december  we acquired wvei fm formerly wbec fm  a station in springfield  massachusetts for million in cash

on december   we completed an exchange transaction with cumulus media partners  llc cumulus pursuant to which we acquired a cincinnati  ohio radio station  wswd fm  in exchange for another cincinnati  ohio radio station  wgrr fm which we acquired from cbs radio stations inc cbs as described below 
on november   each party began operating the other party s respective radio station under a tba 
subsequently  on february   bonneville international corporation bonneville began operating wswd fm under a tba 
for  the operation of wswd fm by us increased our net revenues and decreased our station operating expenses 
on november   we acquired from cbs four radio stations in austin  texas  and three radio stations in memphis  tennessee for million in cash 
we began operating these stations on november  under a tba 
for  the operation and subsequent acquisition of these stations increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  tba expense and interest expense 
on november   we acquired from cbs four radio stations in cincinnati  ohio for million in cash 
from november  through february   we operated three of these stations under a tba 
on february   bonneville began operating the same three stations under a tba with us 
during the period we operated and subsequently acquired these stations  for  our net revenues and our station operating expenses decreased and our tba expense and interest expense increased 
on november   we acquired from cbs four stations in rochester  new york for million in cash for  the acquisition of these stations resulted in an increase to our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense

dispositions we recognized as discontinued operations three stations in rochester  new york  that required us to conform the prior years financial statements to the current year s presentation 
on february   in connection with our pending radio station exchange with bonneville  bonneville began operating three of our seven seattle  washington  radio stations  under a tba with us

financing on june   we entered into a new credit facility that resulted in the recognition of a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs 
our interest expense increased due to additional interest expense on increased borrowings under our current and former senior credit facilities used to finance i the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders that commenced during the first quarter of  ii the repurchase of our stock  and iii radio station acquisitions during the fourth quarters of and other in connection with our review of our fcc licenses under the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment loss of million in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  one of the contributing factors that caused the impairment loss was a decrease in forecasted growth of advertising for the radio industry 
in addition  the impairment loss recorded for the broadcasting licenses in new orleans was primarily due to the longer than expected economic recovery of the city after hurricane katrina 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment loss of million  with respect to our denver market  in connection with our review of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
a contributing factor to the impairment was a decline in the aggregate advertising dollars in the denver market and its affect on our operations 
the amount of the goodwill impairment was negatively impacted by an increase in the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses in the denver market 
without this increase in the fair value of the fcc broadcasting licenses  the goodwill impairment would have been less than million 
in  we reflected million in corporate general and administrative expenses relating to an investigation by and settlement with the new york attorney general nyag plus a reserve for an investigation by the fcc 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a discrete income tax expense adjustment of million as we commenced operations in in states which on average have higher income tax rates than in states in which we previously operated 
non cash compensation expense increased in as we granted equity awards in and in due to the acceleration of most unvested out of the money options prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   our non cash compensation expense in and in was not impacted by the expense recognition requirements for most of our options granted prior to january  
net revenues december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change our overall increase in net revenues during was primarily due to our commencement of operations on november  in the austin and memphis markets under a tba  on february   in the san francisco market under a tba  and on december  upon the acquisition of four stations in the rochester market 
this increase was partially offset by the decrease in net revenues due to the commencement of operations by other parties under tbas on i february  for three of our seven seattle stations  ii february  for a station in the austin market  and iii february  for one of our seven portland stations 
austin and san francisco were new markets for our operations 
due to the exit by us from the cincinnati market on february   which was a new market for us in  our net revenues decreased in as compared to our performance was affected by a challenging and varied advertising environment  as we experienced increases in net revenues for many of our radio stations in markets such as boston  seattle and indianapolis  partially offset by decreases in net revenues for many of our radio stations in markets such as greenville  norfolk and sacramento 
same station considerations net revenues in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations as of january  net revenues in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted net revenues to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations as of january  station operating expenses december  december  dollars in millions station operating expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in station operating expenses was primarily due to our commencement of operations a on november  in the austin and memphis markets under a tba  b on february   in the san francisco market under a tba  and c on december  upon the acquisition of four stations in the rochester market  an increase in rights fees in the first year of a recently renewed ten year sports rights agreement with the boston red sox  an increase in non cash compensation expense of million  and the effects of inflation 
this increase was offset by the decrease in station operating expenses resulting from the commencement of operations by other parties under tbas on i february  for three of our seven stations in the seattle market  ii february  for one of our four stations in the austin market  and iii february  for one of our seven stations in the portland market 
due to the exit by us from the cincinnati market in  which was a new market for us in  our station operating expenses decreased in as compared to same station considerations station operating expenses for would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations as of january  station operating expenses for would have been lower by million if we had adjusted station operating expenses to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations as of january  depreciation and amortization expenses december  december  dollars in millions depreciation and amortization expenses amount of change percentage change depreciation and amortization expenses increased in the fourth quarter of as we consummated million in acquisitions with certain assets subject to amortization and depreciation 
corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  dollars in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the recognition of certain expenses in of million relating to an investigation by and settlement with the nyag  plus a reserve for an investigation by the fcc  and million from the write off of transaction costs during the first quarter of that were associated with an acquisition that did not materialize 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was partially offset by i legal costs of million associated with the legal proceedings described in part i  item  legal proceedings  ii an increase in non cash compensation expense of million for equity awards we granted in and in due to the acceleration of most unvested out of the money options prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   our non cash compensation expense in and in was not impacted by the expense recognition requirements for most of our options granted prior to january   iii the addition in of several corporate positions  and iv the effects of inflation 
operating income december  december  dollars in millionas operating income amount of change percentage change the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impairment loss totaling million for the year ended december  for further discussion  please see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and an increase in tba fees primarily associated with the cbs transaction 
this decrease in operating income was partially offset by i a decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses for the reasons described under corporate general and administrative expenses  ii an increase in net revenues for the reasons described above under net revenues  net of an increase in station operating expenses for the reasons described above under station operating expenses  and iii a net gain on sale or disposal of assets of million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the year ended december   primarily related to the recovery in of insurance proceeds 
same station considerations operating income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations exclusive of depreciation and amortization expenses and tba fees  where applicable 
operating income in would have been lower by million if we had adjusted operating income to give effect to acquisitions and dispositions of radio stations exclusive of depreciation and amortization expenses and tba fees  where applicable 
interest expense december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding debt under our senior credit agreement used to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the amount of million during the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   quarterly dividend payments that commenced during the first quarter of  and the acquisition of radio station assets in several markets for million during the fourth quarter of and million during the fourth quarter of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in borrowing costs in related to the refinancing of our senior credit agreement during the second quarter of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income loss from continuing operations before income taxes amount of change percentage change the decrease in income loss from continuing operations before income taxes to a loss from continuing operations before income taxes was mainly attributable to a decrease in operating income of million due to the factors described above under operating income  and an increase in interest expense of million for the reasons described above under interest expense 
income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income tax amount of change percentage change the decrease in income taxes is primarily the result of a deferred tax benefit of million that was associated with a goodwill and fcc license impairment loss of million for the year ended december  as described above under operating income 
income tax expense as a percentage of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes was in as compared to in if we were to exclude the impairment loss and discrete items of tax in  our income tax expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations would have been similar to the rate in the income tax rate of on a loss from continuing operations before tax for was negatively impacted by discrete items of tax  such as a million increase in taxes due to the commencement of operations in in states that on average have higher income tax rates than states in which we previously operated and the resulting effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of permanent differences between income subject to income tax for book and tax purposes limits on the deduction of certain compensation expense for select employees  income taxes in certain states where the states current taxable income is dependent on factors other than our consolidated net income  and the effect of recording changes in our fin liabilities for interest and penalties  subsequent to adoption of fin on january  the effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by a deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million from a state income tax credit that resulted from the relocation of certain studio facilities in that state 
including the tax effect of income from discontinued operations  for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were a tax benefit of million and a tax expense of million  respectively  and for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were a tax benefit of million and an income tax expense of million  respectively 
we estimate that our annual tax rate for  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be in the low range 
we estimate that our rate in will be affected primarily by changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  adding facilities in states that on average have higher or lower income tax rates than states in which we currently operate and its effect on previously reported temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities  the effect of recording changes in our fin liabilities  and the limitations on the deduction of cash and certain non cash compensation expense for certain key employees 
our effective tax rate may also be materially impacted by i regulatory changes in certain states in which we operate  ii changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  iii changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and iv changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
our net non current deferred tax liabilities were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we do not amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
since our fcc licenses are amortized for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
due to the impairment loss in  our deferred tax liabilities decreased by million

income tax expense as a percentage of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes was in as compared to in the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of limitations on deductibility for tax purposes of certain expenses associated with a reserve for an investigation by the fcc  the impact of limitations on deductibility for tax purposes of share based compensation for certain key employees  and an increase in our valuation allowances and contingencies 
this increase was partially offset by a changes in apportioned income to the states in which we operate  and b federal income tax credits from the effect of hurricane katrina 
including the tax effect of income from discontinued operations  for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were a tax benefit of million and a tax expense of million  respectively  and for the year ended december   the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were an income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
our net non current deferred tax liabilities were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we do not amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
since our fcc licenses are amortized for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically occur only in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction

liquidity and capital resources since we began our share repurchase initiative in may  we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to repurchase shares of our class a common stock see liquidity and capital resources share repurchase programs below 
generally  our acquisitions  share repurchases  reductions of our outstanding debt  dividends and other capital requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our credit agreement  internally generated cash flow  and the issuance and sale of securities 
we have also used a portion of our capital resources to pay dividends in the aggregate amount of million during the years ended december  and prior to the payment of our first quarterly dividend as a public company in march  we had not declared any dividends on any class of our common stock 
any future dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors based upon the relevant factors at the time of such consideration 
our new credit agreement on june   we entered into a new credit agreement the bank facility with a syndicate of banks for a  million senior secured credit facility that matures on june  and is comprised of million in revolving credit revolver and a million term loan term a 
we used the proceeds of million from term a and million from the revolver to pay all of the outstanding debt under our former senior credit facility and the transaction costs of the bank facility 
we are required to make repayments of the term a beginning september  in quarterly amounts starting at million and increasing to million 
we expect to use the remainder of the revolver to provide for working capital  and provide for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and any or all of the following repurchases of class a common stock  repurchases our senior subordinated notes  dividends and acquisitions 
the bank facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the bank facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which are defined terms within the agreement 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the bank facility 
closing on any future acquisitions is conditioned on compliance under the bank facility at the time of closing 
our former credit agreement our former credit agreement consisted of a five year million as amended senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that matured on august  the facility was secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our owned subsidiaries and required us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which were defined terms within the agreement 
our senior subordinated notes on march   we issued million of senior subordinated notes the notes due march   and we received net proceeds of million 
interest on the notes  which are in denominations of  each  accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september we may redeem the notes at an initial redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to our senior indebtedness 
our senior subordinated notes also require us to comply with certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
the covenants under the senior subordinated notes are  in general  less restrictive than the covenants under the bank facility 
liquidity our liquidity requirements are for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and any one or more of the following repurchases of our class a common stock  repurchases of our senior subordinated notes  dividends and acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we paid million in income taxes that primarily included certain estimated state taxes for in  we expect to benefit from the tax deductions for depreciation and amortization on assets acquired in accordingly  these tax benefits will minimize the amount of quarterly estimated federal if any and certain state income tax payments we expect to make in based upon projected quarterly taxable income 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in and million in we anticipate that capital expenditures in will consist of million incurred during the ordinary course of business  and between million and million primarily for a the consolidation and or relocation of studio and office facilities in certain markets  and b the continued conversion to digital radio 
as of december   we had credit available of up to million under the bank facility  subject to compliance with the covenants at the time of borrowing and after giving effect to our use of the borrowed funds 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we increased our net outstanding debt by million  primarily to acquire radio stations in of million  to help fund our repurchase of shares in the amount of million and to pay dividends of million to shareholders 
as of december   we had outstanding million in senior debt  including million under our bank facility  million in a letter of credit  and million in senior subordinated notes 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank facility  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future  including cash to fund our operations  repurchases of our stock  repurchases of our senior subordinated notes and any declared dividends 
our bank facility requires that we must be in compliance with certain covenants in our credit agreement  and we believe that we will maintain our compliance with these covenants 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending the bank facility  in entering into a new credit agreement or in obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of the bank facility could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income after excluding the effect of a non cash loss on impairment of million  net of a tax benefit of million largely due to an increase in tba fees and interest expense for the reasons described under results of operations  and an increase in working capital of million that was primarily due to a the payment in of the million in accrued expenses as of december  relating to an investigation by and settlement with the nyag plus a reserve for an investigation by the fcc  and b an increase in prepaid and refundable income taxes associated with the loss for tax purposes that will be refundable from a prior year s tax obligations 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in was mainly attributable to a decrease in net income of million net of gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets and non cash stock based compensation expense to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and an increase in working capital requirements of million that was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the commencement of new station operations in several markets 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended december   and reflect i purchases of radio station assets of million  million and million  respectively  and ii additions to property and equipment of million million and million  respectively

credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
recently  we have been downgraded by the rating agencies  but the downgrades have had no effect on our interest expense 
any future significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity by limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future credit agreements  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
share repurchase programs over the past several years  our board of directors authorized several programs to repurchase our class a common stock in amounts not to exceed million for each program 
under these repurchase programs  we repurchased and immediately retired in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  and in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   million remained authorized as available for repurchase under the current program that will expire on may  we expect to use cash available under our bank facility and internally generated cash flow as a source of funds to repurchase shares under the remaining program 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a the maturity on our bank facility  with outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december   could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
a we have obligations of million to acquire the assets of radio stations under a pending asset exchange agreement in the san francisco market 
the obligation under this asset exchange agreement was determined under the provisions of sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
b we have million in liabilities related to i our obligation to provide a letter of credit  ii construction obligations  and iii obligations to increase our interest in a certain partnership 
c in addition to the above  purchase obligations of million include contracts primarily for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and our operating results 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities  including fin liabilities  have been reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we had an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  on january   we entered into an agreement with bonneville to exchange certain radio stations in cincinnati  ohio  and seattle  washington  for certain radio stations in san francisco  california  and million in cash 
concurrently with entering into this asset exchange agreement  we entered into a tba 
the provisions of financial interpretation no 
r as revised  or fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
in connection with this transaction  we determined that fin r was applicable as the buyer  bonneville  had a variable interest in and was the primary beneficiary of our entity that contained the cincinnati radio station assets 
as the primary beneficiary  bonneville could incur the expected losses that could arise from the variability of the fair value of the variable interest entity 
as a result  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of those entities holding our cincinnati assets into a balance sheet classification as an investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries in the amount of million 
the investment in deconsolidated subsidiaries reflects the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity that contain the cincinnati assets that will be disposed of under the asset exchange agreement see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the variable interest entity 
we enter into interest rate contracts collars and swaps to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued pronouncements sfas dig no

 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards on june   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards 
certain stock based compensation arrangements contain provisions that entitle an employee to receive dividends on the unvested portion of the awards 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  such dividend features are factored into the value of the award at the grant date and  to the extent that an award is expected to vest  the dividends are charged to retained earnings 
under us tax law  however  such dividend payments are generally considered additional compensation expense when they are paid to employees  and therefore  are generally deductible by the employer on a current basis for tax purposes 
under eitf no 
 a realized tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for equity classified unvested equity shares  unvested equity share units  and outstanding share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital 
those tax benefits are considered windfall tax benefits under sfas no 
r 
this guidance is effective for us on january  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
fas no 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas no 
permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
such entities are also required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
fas no 
is effective for us as of january  the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption 
subject to any changes to the facts and circumstances used in our evaluation  we believe that the adoption of fas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fas no

fas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
fas no

will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
our historical reserves have averaged less than of our outstanding receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers or markets were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
the effect of a increase in our outstanding accounts receivable allowance as of december   would result in an increase to our net loss of million  net of taxes an increase in net loss per common share diluted of  for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represented of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million for radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of our tax rates we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is increased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities requires us to account for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin on january   we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based upon its technical merits  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions  and review whether any new uncertain tax positions have arisen  on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  historical experience with similar tax matters  guidance from our tax advisors  and new audit activity 
a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which the change occurs 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates  as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
in past years  our estimate of our tax rate has varied from to 
for  if we excluded the discrete items of tax and the impairment loss  then our tax rate would have been in the low percent range 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rate  as of december   would result in an increase in income tax expense of million and an increase in net loss of million net income per common share diluted of for the year ended december  valuation of share based compensation we determine the fair value of restricted stock units with service and market conditions using a monte carlo simulation model 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are subject to renewal every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
subject to delays in processing by the fcc  historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment 
the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank facility 
if the borrowing rates under our libor loans were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank facility would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
we do not have interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes  which have a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had a derivative rate hedging transaction in place for a notional amount of million that effectively fixes libor at and expires in february the fair value of the rate hedging transaction at december   based upon current market rates  is included as derivative instruments in other current liabilities 
our rate hedging transaction is tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the three month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the three month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
our derivative instrument liability as of december  was million  which represented a decrease of million from the balance as of december  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease to less than one year in the remaining term of our outstanding hedge  and an increase in the forward interest rates to maturity 
see note  subsequent events  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent derivative transactions 
our credit exposure under this hedging agreement  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the high percentage of local business  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertisers
