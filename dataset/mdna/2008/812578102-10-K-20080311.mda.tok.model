item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined in item a risk factors and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
many of our agreements contain multiple revenue elements including upfront payments  license fees  milestone payments  royalties  maintenance fees and payments received for the delivery of supplies or services provided 
each agreement may contain some or all of these elements 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of materials occurring or services being rendered  fees being fixed or determinable and collectibility being reasonably assured 
where activities represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and verifiable evidence of the fair value of each element can be established  revenue is recognized as the activities are completed 
when verifiable evidence of fair value cannot be established for each undelivered element  revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered or until verifiable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered element can be determined 
where activities represent substantive continuing obligations and fair value cannot be determined  revenue is recognized over the service period using either a time based or an activity based proportional performance model as appropriate in the circumstance 
nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees and milestone payments we enter into various collaborative agreements that generate nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees  and payments triggered by the achievement of development milestones by the other party or by us 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized using either a time based or proportional performance based approach 
when we cannot estimate the total amount of performance obligations that are to be provided under the arrangement  a time based method is used 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
when we are able to estimate the total amount of performance obligations under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
under this approach  revenue recognition is based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs to be 
table of contents incurred over the performance period as this is considered to be representative of the delivery of service under the arrangement 
changes in estimates of total expected performance costs or service obligation time period are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
under both methods  revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
deferred revenue arises from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 
deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement or when a substantive at risk milestone payment reflecting the culmination of a separate earnings process is received  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone event 
research and development services we may also perform research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners that are paid for by the collaborator 
revenue from research and development services is generally recognized as the service is provided 
however  if the arrangement contains multiple delivery elements for which verifiable and objective evidence of fair value cannot be established for each element  payments for such services are recognized as revenue over the service period 
royalties revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not received significant royalty revenues 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis  or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts earned  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts received in excess of amounts recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses for drug discovery and research  development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trial activities 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial and patient accrual into the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments for clinical trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations  net of reimbursement paid to and received from  are reflected in r d expense 
share based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r effective january  as a result  we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that net deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance will be required on losses reported in future periods 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing monoclonal antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
our business strategy is focused on advancing our portfolio of product candidates in diseases with unmet medical need and significant market potential 
we have a worldwide collaboration agreement with genentech to develop and commercialize our product candidate sgn in addition  we currently have two other proprietary product candidates in ongoing clinical trials  sgn and sgn  as well as several lead preclinical product candidates  including sgn  sgn and an anti cd antibody drug conjugate 
our pipeline of product candidates is based upon two technologies engineered monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibody drug conjugates  or adcs 
these technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill target cells on their own as well as to increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by linking them to a cell killing payload to form an adc 
in addition to our internal pipeline  we have adc license agreements with a number of leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including genentech  bayer  curagen  progenics and medimmune  as well as an adc co development agreement with agensys 

table of contents we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
all of our product candidates are in relatively early stages of development and significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing and move towards commercialization of our product candidates 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds and resources 
our operating expenses will also likely increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional product candidates are selected for clinical development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards commercialization 
we expect that a substantial portion of our revenues for the next several years will be the result of amortization of payments already received and expected to be received from genentech under our sgn collaboration agreement 
our revenues for the foreseeable future will also depend on achieving development and clinical milestones under our existing collaboration and license agreements  particularly our sgn collaboration with genentech  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues in increased by to million from and increased in by to million from our revenues reflect amounts earned under our sgn collaboration agreement in and for all years presented  the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments received under our adc collaborations as well as funded research and material supply fees 
revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenues in thousands annual percentage change genentech medimmune progenics bayer curagen other collaborations total revenue growth in is primarily the result of amounts earned under our sgn collaboration with genentech that was entered into in january revenues in also reflect amounts earned under our adc collaborations with genentech  medimmune and progenics  which when combined with sgn collaboration revenue  represent approximately million  or  of total collaboration and license agreement revenues 
revenues in consist primarily of amounts earned under our genentech  curagen and progenics adc collaborations  which represent approximately million  or  of total collaboration and license agreement revenues 
similarly  revenues in consist primarily of amounts earned under our genentech and curagen adc collaborations  which represent approximately million  or  of total collaboration and license agreement revenues 
these revenues will vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter depending on the development progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates 
we anticipate that revenues in 
table of contents will increase compared to as a result of amounts earned under our sgn collaboration with genentech 
genentech we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with genentech in january for the development and commercialization of sgn under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and are entitled to receive progress dependent milestone payments and royalties on net sales of any resulting products 
in addition  sgn research and development activities that we perform are reimbursed by genentech 
we received milestone payments of million during the fourth quarter of triggered by the initiation of sgn clinical trials 
all amounts billed under the sgn collaboration agreement are deferred and recognized as revenue over the six year development period ending february using a time based method 
we entered into an adc collaboration with genentech in april under which we have received as of december  technology access fees totaling million 
this amount includes a fee of million received in march to exercise exclusive licenses to specific targets and extend the research term under the adc collaboration agreement 
the million payment  along with the remaining deferred portion of the previously received license fees received under the collaboration have been deferred and will be recognized over the extended three year research term of the collaboration using a time based approach which continues until april we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as genentech s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales 
revenues under all agreements with genentech in increased by million  or  primarily due to amounts earned under our sgn collaboration agreement 
revenues received from genentech in decreased by  or  from reflecting lower milestone payments and funded research and supply fees earned during the year 
a substantial portion of our deferred revenue balance  which totaled million as of december   relates to our sgn collaboration with genentech and will be recognized into revenue through february commensurate with our remaining service period commitment pursuant to the collaboration 
medimmune we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with medimmune  a wholly owned subsidiary of astrazeneca  in april which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee was recognized as revenue over the two year research period of the collaboration 
in october  medimmune exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to a second antigen target under the existing adc collaboration 
we received a million payment from medimmune as a result of the option exercise which will be recognized as revenue over a twelve month period commensurate with our remaining service period commitment under the agreement 
revenues increased by  in primarily attributable to increased material supply fees 
revenues increased by  or  in primarily attributable to the earned portion of the upfront technology access fee 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as medimmune s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales

bayer we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with bayer in september which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee was recognized as revenue over the three year research period of the collaboration 
revenues decreased by  or  in  reflecting completion of the recognition of the upfront technology access fee 
revenues increased by  or  in primarily reflecting a full year of recognition of the upfront technology access fee as well as increased funded research and material supply fees 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones and annual maintenance fees as bayer s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
curagen we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with curagen in june which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee  along with additional access fees received  was recognized as revenue over the two year research period 
revenues in decreased by million  or  due to completion  in  of recognition of the upfront technology access fee 
revenues in decreased by  or  from reflecting the partial year recognition of the upfront technology access fee and included a milestone payment resulting from curagen s initiation of clinical testing of its lead adc product candidate utilizing our technology 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as curagen s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales 
other collaborations other collaborations consist of collaborative agreements that have concluded  research agreements established to explore future business relationships and royalty payments from suppliers to which we have granted limited access to our technology under preferred provider agreements 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from and increased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses increased to million in from primarily due to higher personnel expenses  severance costs  license fees  laboratory supply and building related service costs 
research expenses of million in increased from  reflecting slightly higher personnel expenses and lower in license fees paid to gain access to new technologies 

table of contents development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our drug product candidates 
development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from due to increased manufacturing activities  pharmacology toxicology studies and compensation costs related to higher staffing levels 
manufacturing costs increased by million in from reflecting continuing activities with laureate pharma for production of sgn clinical supply 
pharmacology and toxicology study costs for sgn and sgn increased by million in from reflecting increased preclinical study activities 
manufacturing costs decreased for sgn by  in from reflecting the completion of manufacturing activities at laureate pharma 
pharmacology and toxicology costs for sgn decreased by  in from due to the completion of toxicology studies in development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from primarily due to the timing of manufacturing campaigns 
contract manufacturing costs increased million for sgn and increased million for sgn in from primarily reflecting new activities with laureate pharma 
development and contract manufacturing expenses in also include increases in personnel expenses  lab supplies associated with higher staffing levels and depreciation expenses 
manufacturing costs decreased by million for sgn and decreased million for sgn in from  reflecting the substantial completion during of activities with abbott laboratories for sgn and albany molecular for sgn clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical costs increased to million in from due to expanded third party clinical trial costs associated with our sgn  sgn and sgn programs and compensation costs relating to increased staffing levels 
the increases in clinical costs are partially offset by lower sgn program costs in reflecting the substantial completion of company sponsored clinical trials of sgn during clinical costs increased to million in from due to higher personnel expenses and third party costs associated with sgn and sgn  which were partially offset by decreased third party costs due to the discontinuation of our sgn program 
share based compensation expenses reflect the non cash charge relating to the adoption of fas r on january   under which the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the stock option 
share based compensation expense increased to million in from primarily due to an increase in the value of the options granted due to an increase in our stock price 
non cash share based compensation expense in also includes a charge for accelerated vesting of stock options for employee severance 
we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple projects  including our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs 
many of our costs are not directly attributable to a specific project and we have not historically allocated our infrastructure costs or accounted for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we do not report actual total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
we do  however  separately account for significant third party costs of development programs identified as product candidates for further preclinical and clinical development 

table of contents the following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support  contract manufacturing for clinical supplies and clinical trial services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates 
the table also presents unallocated costs  which consist of personnel  facilities and other costs not directly allocable to development programs product candidates in thousands annual percentage change years january  to december  sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn total third party costs unallocated costs and overhead share based compensation expense total research and development our third party costs for sgn in and reflect costs associated with our phase i and ii clinical studies and our manufacturing activities conducted by laureate pharma to perform gmp manufacturing of drug product to support clinical trials 
we expect our third party costs for sgn to increase from amounts incurred in as clinical activities expand and manufacturing activities continue 
sgn costs reflect increased enrollment in our ongoing phase i and ii clinical trials and third party clinical costs in and and contract manufacturing costs incurred at abbott laboratories in under our sgn collaboration agreement  genentech reimburses us for activities that we perform under the agreement  which have increased as we have expanded clinical development activities for sgn expenses that we incur under the sgn collaboration are included in our research and development expense  while reimbursements of those expenses by genentech are recognized as revenues over the term of the agreement 
we expect third party costs associated with clinical trials of sgn to increase as we continue to enroll patients and expand our sgn phase i and ii clinical trials 
our third party costs for sgn in and included activities conducted by laureate pharma to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing of drug product to support clinical trials and increased pharmacology toxicology activities 
we expect third party costs for sgn to decrease from amounts incurred in as manufacturing and pharmacology toxicology activities lessen 
sgn third party costs in are primarily attributable to our phase i clinical trial and contract manufacturing activities 
sgn third party costs in and are primarily attributable to contract manufacturing and preclinical studies necessary to initiate a phase i clinical trial 
we expect third party costs for sgn to increase as we expand our clinical trials and initiate additional contract manufacturing activities 
sgn third party costs are attributable to our phase i and phase ii clinical trials 
during  we made a decision to cease company sponsored clinical trials of sgn the national cancer institute nci continues to conduct limited clinical trials of sgn which we have supported by providing supplies of clinical material 
the majority of the costs for these trials will be incurred by the nci and not reflected in our future financial results 
as a result  we expect third party costs for sgn to decrease from the amounts incurred in the preceding year 

table of contents our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy may include entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities and advance new product candidates into clinical trials 
in particular  we expect that clinical trial and manufacturing costs for sgn  sgn and sgn will increase in compared to expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

share based compensation expense increased to million in from primarily as a result of an increase in the value of the options granted due to an increase in our stock price during we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of increased costs related to adding administrative personnel in support of our growing operations 
investment income  net investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  the increase was primarily due to increasing average interest yields and additional interest income received from investing payments received from genentech under our sgn collaboration 
in  the increase was primarily due to increasing average interest yields and additional interest income received from investing the net proceeds of approximately million from our public offerings of common stock that were completed in april and may although we will increase our invested funds as a result of our public offering completed in january with net proceeds to us of approximately million  we expect investment income in to be below amounts reflecting lower expected average interest yields

to a lesser degree  we have also financed our operations through interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in reflects million received in upfront and milestone payments under our collaboration with genentech and million received from genentech to extend its adc collaboration with us 
in  we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and warrant exercises 
these cash inflows were offset by approximately million used 
table of contents to finance our operations 
the increase in was primarily the result of net proceeds of million from our common stock financings  offset by million used to finance our operations 
our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio to align scheduled maturities of investment securities with our working capital needs 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments and subject to investment guidelines allowing for investments in us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
we currently hold auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  or a sale of the security in a secondary market 
as of december   the failed auction rate securities carry aaa ratings and continue to pay interest according to the stated terms 
based on our available cash  expected operating cash requirements  our belief that our holdings in auction rate securities can be liquidated within one year through a successful auction or redemption at par and our ability and intent to hold such investments until liquidation  we believe that the current illiquidity of these investments is temporary 
however  we will reassess this conclusion in future reporting periods based on several factors  including the continued failure of future auctions  failure of the investment to be redeemed  deterioration of the credit rating of the investment  market risk and other factors 
such a reassessment may change the classification to long term investments or result in a conclusion that these investments are more than temporarily impaired and result in a write down in the fair value of these investments 
included in cash provided by or used in investing activities are capital expenditures of million in including expenditures for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for our additional office space of approximately  square feet which we began occupying in december the increase in also included expenditures for lab equipment and computers to support our expanding research and development activities 
capital expenditures of million in and million in consisted primarily of lab equipment and computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities and in support of employee growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will decrease compared to reflecting lower leasehold improvements 
at our currently planned spending rate  we believe our current financial resources in addition to the expected fees and milestone payments earned under the sgn collaboration agreement with genentech and other existing collaboration and license agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of however  changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses preceding commercialization of a product candidate 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
in  we expect our revenues to range from million to million  which reflects the earned portion of the deferred revenue and milestone payments and funded research payments expected to be received from genentech  as well as revenues earned under our existing adc collaborations 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities and advance new product candidates into clinical trials 
in  we expect our operating expenses to range from million to million 
in particular  we expect that clinical trial costs for sgn  sgn and sgn and manufacturing costs for sgn and sgn will increase in compared to expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial 
we expect that non cash expenses in will be in the million to million range  
table of contents the majority of which relates to share based compensation expense 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of option grants  and may therefore change 
we expect that net cash used to fund our operating activities in will be in the range of million to million 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth below for any given year could be substantially higher if we make certain development progress that requires us to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements tenant improvements  furnishings and other equipment total operating lease obligations do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements primarily represent contractual obligations related to performing scale up and gmp manufacturing for monoclonal antibody and adc products for use in our clinical trials  including our contract manufacturing agreement with laureate pharma 
the minimum payments under tenant improvements  furnishings and other equipment primarily represent obligations in support of our expansion into our new building lease for additional office space 
the above table excludes royalties and payments of up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements for our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable with respect to timing  such contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment has occurred 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have pledged approximately  of our investments and the majority of our property and equipment as collateral under the lease 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
in the event that we fail to meet specific thresholds of market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investment balances  we are obligated to increase our restricted investment balance to approximately million 
at december   we were in compliance with these thresholds
