item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute video game software and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms  including video game consoles such as the sony playstation and playstation  microsoft xbox tm and nintendo wii tm  personal computers  handheld game players such as the playstation portable psp tm and the nintendo ds tm and cellular handsets 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  harry potter and fifa soccer  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims tm  need for speed tm and pogo tm 
our goal is to publish titles with global mass market appeal  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products eg  madden nfl football  ncaa football and fifa soccer  wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims  need for speed and battlefield and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties eg  lord of the rings and harry potter 
special note regarding deferred net revenue the ubiquity of high speed internet access and the integration of network connectivity into new generation game consoles are expected to continue to increase demand for games with online enabled features 
to address this demand  many of our software products are developed with the ability to be connected to  and played via  the internet 
in order for consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet  we either directly or through outsourced arrangements with third parties maintain servers which support an online service we offer to consumers for activities such as matchmaking 
in situations where we do not separately sell this online service  we account for the sale of the software product as a bundle sale  or multiple element arrangement  in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 
through fiscal  for accounting purposes  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe existed for the online service 
accordingly  we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service offered and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately 
however  starting in fiscal  for accounting purposes  the required vendor specific objective evidence of fair value did not exist for the online service related to certain of our online enabled software products 
this prevented us from allocating and separately recognizing revenue related to the software product and the online service 
accordingly  starting in fiscal  we began to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of our online enabled software products for the pc  playstation  playstation  wii and the psp on a deferred basis over an estimated online service period  which we estimate to be six months beginning in the month after shipment 
on a quarterly basis  the deferral amount will vary significantly depending upon the number of titles we release  the timing of their release  sales volume  returns and price protection provided for these online enabled software products 
in addition  we expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions during the period in which the product is delivered rather than on a deferred basis  which inherently creates volatility in our reported gross margin percentages 

table of contents as of march   we had an accumulated balance of million of deferred net revenue related to online enabled packaged goods and digital content  substantially all of which was driven by sales made during the six months ended march  as of march   we had an accumulated balance of million of deferred net revenue related to online enabled packaged goods and digital content 
financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was billion  up percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the impact of deferrals related to packaged goods and digital content for the fiscal year ended march  decreased our reported net revenue and operating income by million 
net revenue was driven by sales of rock band  madden nfl  fifa  need for speed prostreet  and the simpsons tm game 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to diluted income per share of for the fiscal year ended march  net income decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold of million  an increase in sales of online enabled titles for which we were unable to establish vsoe that resulted in the net deferral of million of net revenue out of fiscal and into future periods  an increase of million in acquired in process technology primarily due to our acquisition of vg holding corp  losses on strategic investments of million  an increase of million in personnel related costs  an increase of million in marketing  advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and incremental spending on recurring franchises  and an increase of million in restructuring charges primarily as a result of our fiscal reorganization 
these items were partially offset by an increase in million in net revenue and million lower income tax expense 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during the year ended march   as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses paid resulting from an increase in advertising and marketing costs  external development expenses and personnel related expenses  and a million increase in incentive based cash compensation paid in fiscal which were earned with respect to fiscal performance 
these decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue collected during fiscal as compared to fiscal management s overview of historical and prospective business trends fiscal reorganization 
in fiscal  we reorganized our business into four operating labels ea games  ea sports  the sims and ea casual entertainment and an additional group that works closely with the labels global publishing 
each label is structured to operate globally and includes several key functions including development studios  product marketing  and planning for products and services 
global publishing operates in three regions  north america  europe and asia  and is responsible for strategic planning  field marketing  sales  distribution  operations  product certification  quality assurance  motion capture  art outsourcing and localization 
in october  our board of directors approved a plan of reorganization fiscal reorganization plan 
since the inception of the fiscal reorganization plan through march   we incurred charges associated with the closure of our chertsey  england and chicago  illinois facilities  which included asset impairment and lease termination costs  employee related expenses  and other costs including other contract terminations as well as it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the closure of our chertsey facility and consolidated our local operations and employees into our guildford  england facility 
over the next months  we expect to continue to incur it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions 

table of contents including charges incurred through march   we expect to incur cash and non cash charges between million and million by fiscal related to our fiscal reorganization plan 
these charges will consist primarily of employee related costs approximately million in cash charges  facility exit costs approximately million in cash and non cash charges  as well as other reorganization costs including other contract terminations and it and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business support functions approximately million in cash and non cash charges 
transition to a new generation of consoles 
video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well 
the current cycle began with microsoft s launch of the xbox in  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched their next generation systems  the playstation and the wii  respectively 
during fiscal  the installed base of each of these systems continued to expand and  as a result  sales of our products for these systems have also increased significantly 
at the same time  however  demand for video games for prior generation systems  particularly the original xbox and the nintendo gamecube  has declined significantly 
although we expect to continue developing and marketing new titles for the prior generation playstation in fiscal  we only expect to release one title for the original xbox and no titles for the nintendo gamecube 
as a result  we expect our sales of video games for prior generation systems will continue to decline 
the decline in prior generation product sales  particularly the playstation  may be greater or faster than we anticipate  and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or increase more slowly than we anticipate 
moreover  we expect development costs for the new video game systems continue to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for prior generation video game systems 
we have incurred increased costs during this transition as we have continued to develop and market new titles for certain prior generation video game platforms  while also making significant investments in products for the new generation platforms 
we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute basis in fiscal as compared to fiscal although not necessarily as a percentage of net revenue 
online 
today  we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services  including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand  persistent state world games such as ultima online tm and dark age of camelot  pc based downloadable content and online enabled packaged goods 
in addition  we are anticipating the release of a new massively multiplayer online role playing game  warhammer online 
we intend to make significant investments in online products  infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term 
expansion of mobile platforms 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers 
our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 
we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms for several years 
more recently  the sony psp and the nintendo ds  with their enhanced graphics  deeper gameplay  and online functionality  provide a richer mobile gaming experience for consumers 
we expect sales of games for handhelds and cellular handsets to continue to be an important part of our business worldwide 
acquisitions and investments 
we have engaged in  evaluated  and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions of companies  businesses  intellectual properties  and other assets 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have announced and or completed several acquisitions and investments  including in january  we completed our acquisition of vg holding corp 
vgh  owner of both bioware corp 
and pandemic studios  llc  which create action  adventure  and role playing games 
vgh was headquartered in menlo park  california 
bioware corp 
and pandemic studios are located in edmonton  canada  los angeles  california  austin  texas  and brisbane  australia 

table of contents in may  we entered into a licensing agreement with and made a strategic equity investment in the limited  a leading online game operator in china 
the licensing agreement gives the exclusive publishing rights for ea sports tmfifa online in mainland china 
in april  we expanded our commercial agreements with and made strategic equity investments in neowiz corporation and a related online gaming company  neowiz games we refer to neowiz corporation and neowiz games collectively as neowiz 
based in korea  neowiz is an online media and gaming company with which we partnered in to launch ea sports fifa online in korea 
in october  the remaining outstanding shares of digital illusions ce dice located in sweden  were purchased  thereby completing the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of dice 
in july  we acquired mythic entertainment  inc  located in virginia  as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in the massively multiplayer online role playing market 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of take two interactive software  inc take two  for a total purchase price of approximately billion including fees and expenses 
take two s board of directors has stated that our offer undervalues the company and is not in the best interests of stockholders 
if we were to acquire take two  we expect the acquisition would have a material impact on our future financial position and results of operations and cash flows 
although the offer is not conditional upon any financing arrangements  our board of directors has authorized us to obtain additional financing  a portion of which may be used in part to fund the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that we will acquire take two 
international operations and foreign currency exchange impact 
international sales are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal and approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and  to a much lesser extent  in asia 
year over year  we estimate that foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue of million  or percent  for the year ended march  we believe that in order to succeed internationally  it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and consumers 
stock based compensation 
beginning on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  and applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
during fiscal  we recognized stock based compensation of million  pre tax  and million  net of tax 
during fiscal  we recognized stock based compensation of million  pre tax  and million  net of tax 
stock based compensation expense has been reflected in the respective functional line items on our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  playstation  xbox and wii  pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the psp and nintendo ds  and cellular handsets 
we evaluate the 
table of contents recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products that must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for online game services  delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided 
for digital downloads that do not have an online service component  delivery is considered to occur generally when the download occurs 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
for example  in connection with some of our packaged goods product sales  we offer an online service without an additional fee 
prior to fiscal  we were able to determine vsoe for the online service to be delivered  therefore  we were able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately 
however  starting in fiscal  vsoe does not exist for the online service to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions are recognized over the estimated online service period 
more specifically  starting in fiscal  we began to recognize the revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods on a straight line basis over a six month period beginning in the month after shipment 
accordingly  this relatively small change from having vsoe for the online service to no longer having vsoe has had a significant effect on our reported results 
determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult 
the accounting for these transactions is significantly different 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download occurs assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
revenue from online game services is recognized as the services are rendered 
if the service period is not defined  we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period 
determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product 
the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system products  which allow for the exchange of these products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 

table of contents in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in retail and the video game segment  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation console moves through its lifecycle 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
in addition  if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods products change  the amount of net deferred revenue we recognize in the future would change 
significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion on the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  acquired in process technology and equity instruments granted for services  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset  liability or equity instrument being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 

table of contents while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities assumed and acquired in process technology in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material affect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives and acquired in process technology is expensed upon consummation 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of assets 
current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
for some assets  our estimated fair value is dependent upon our predictions of which of our products we develop will be successful which is dependent upon several things beyond our control  such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill by applying a fair value based test 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
determining the estimated fair value for each reporting unit could be materially affected by changes in estimates and assumptions which could trigger impairment 
stock based compensation 
we are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is determined using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make certain assumptions about the future 
determining the estimated fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the black scholes valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use a combination of historical stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate  which is based on historical data  as well as future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 

table of contents royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
in either case  we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments 
if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate  then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated 
during fiscal and  we recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
we had no impairments during fiscal income taxes we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 in the first quarter of fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these 
table of contents estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves accounting for uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules  regulations and practices 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognize benefits for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition of a benefit or the absence of a liability by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
if it is not  in our judgment  more likely than not that the position will be sustained  then we do not recognize any benefit for the position 
if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained  a second step in the process is required to estimate how much of the benefit we will ultimately receive 
this second step requires that we estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new facts  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an audit  effective settlement of audit issues  and commencement of new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
as a result of the adoption of fin no 
 we expect our tax rate to be more volatile 
we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and  accordingly  no us taxes have been provided thereon 
although we repatriated funds under the american jobs creation act of in fiscal  we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states

table of contents during fiscal and  we recognized total net revenue of  million and  million  respectively 
our total net revenue during fiscal includes million recognized from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for which we were not able to objectively determine the fair value as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles for software sales of a free online service that we provided in connection with the sale 
the deferral of net revenue related to certain of our packaged goods and digital content sales  which will be recognized in future periods  decreased our reported net revenue by million during fiscal  as compared to the same period a year ago 
from a geographical perspective  our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in millions year ended march  increase change north america europe asia international total net revenue north america for fiscal  net revenue in north america was  million  driven by sales of rock band  madden nfl  and ncaa football net revenue for fiscal increased percent as compared to fiscal the deferral of net revenue related to certain of our packaged goods and digital content sales  which will be recognized in future periods  decreased our reported net revenue by million during fiscal from an operational perspective  the increase in net revenue was driven by a million increase in net revenue from co publishing and distribution titles which does not include an additional million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized in future periods  and a million increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the wii which does not include an additional million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized in future periods 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation this decrease will be partially offset  however  by million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized in future periods  and a million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox 
we continue to expect net revenue in north america to increase during fiscal as compared to fiscal europe for fiscal  net revenue in europe was  million  driven by sales of fifa  need for speed prostreet  and the simpsons game

for fiscal  our effective income tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent due to a number of factors  including certain non deductible stock based compensation expenses and additional charges resulting from certain non deductible acquisition related costs 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions for example  we expect to incur significant intercompany tax charges in connection with our acquisition of vgh in fiscal  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  as well as changes in  or termination of  our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
we have not historically  nor do we currently  hedge our short term investment portfolio 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our equity investments 
further  we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses  as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded 
the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reported in each period in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million  included in other current assets 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of less than million  included in other current assets 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses 
table of contents from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in certain cases  the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated asset or liability  in which case our results will be impacted 
as of march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling and million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 
as of march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pounds sterling and million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 
the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and march  the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks  therefore  the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of million in both scenarios 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts used in cash flow hedging of million in both scenarios 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses on our forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of million and million  respectively  as of march   and million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar 
exchange rates do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
however  because short term securities mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
additionally  the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale and  consequently  recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of any tax effects  in 
table of contents stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  us agency securities corporate bonds us treasury securities asset backed securities commercial paper total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio
