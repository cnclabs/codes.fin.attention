item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in the context of the information included elsewhere in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item of this annual report 
overview our company and our corresponding customer relationships are organized along men s and women s product lines 
as a result we have two reportable segments men s accessories  consisting of belts  wallets  gift accessories  small leather accessories  and sporting goods  and women s accessories  consisting of belts  wallets  and gift accessories 
net sales for fiscal were impacted by the overall negative retail environment and general economic conditions  including curtailed replenishment orders by one of our largest customers  which led us to conclude there was a need to reduce the amount of inventory warehoused and to focus on reducing total inventory levels within a shorter time frame than had been our prior practice 
we recorded an million noncash charge to cost of goods sold in order to accelerate liquidation of out of program and slow moving inventory and significantly reduce total inventory levels 
noncash charges also were recorded for the impairment of goodwill million and write off of intangible customer lists million 
for the year  we had a net loss of million  or per share 
in fiscal  we had net income of million  or per diluted share 

table of contents the following presents sales and gross margin data for our reportable segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
decrease net sales men s accessories women s accessories gross margin men s accessories women s accessories gross margin percent of sales men s accessories women s accessories total our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others

increase decrease selling  general and administrative expense men s accessories women s accessories depreciation and amortization men s accessories women s accessories interest expense operationally  the most significant challenge in fiscal was maintaining gross margins and controlling sg a expenses as net sales for fiscal declined from the fiscal level 
a slowdown in replenishment orders from one of our largest customers which impacted our fiscal fourth quarter results  continued to affect our results until the latter part of fiscal the effect of the dramatic rise in gasoline prices on general economic conditions impacting the retail environment also affected our sales and margins as our customers curtailed their purchases and sought price reductions 
to reduce the amount of inventory warehoused and to focus on reducing total inventory levels within a shorter time frame than had been our prior practice  we adopted an accelerated inventory flow program designed to improve turns and reduce out of program and slow moving inventory 
we marked down all out of program and slow moving inventory to our best estimate of the market value we anticipate we will be able to realize based on our experiences selling through inventory liquidation channels 
we expected that reducing the prices for these items would enable us to liquidate much more inventory than we would have under our previous pricing 
although we believe the out of program and slow moving inventory would continue to be saleable over the long term at previously marked down prices  the new philosophy and valuation methodology is driven by decisions to reduce overall inventory levels and sell large quantities of out of program and slow moving inventory as quickly as possible 
in fiscal we had higher than expected margins on initial sales of the marked down inventory  however  we estimate the marked down amounts are in line with our expectations for selling the remaining out of program and slow moving inventory in fiscal actual amounts realized from this marked down inventory may differ from our estimates and such differences could have a material impact on our future results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
compared to net sales and gross margins our million fiscal net sales were lower than the prior year and our gross margin was percentage points lower  of which percentage points is attributable to the inventory write down 
men s accessories segment net sales of million in fiscal were below the million in fiscal as economic conditions slowed retailers sales of belts and small leather goods 
curtailed levels of replenishment orders from one of the largest customers of our men s accessories segment resulted in million fewer men s belt sales during fiscal net sales of small leather goods were million lower this year compared to last year as one of our department store customers shifted to a new private label and away from our rolfs wallet program 
women s accessories segment net sales of million in fiscal were below the million in fiscal the difficult retail environment  competitive market pressures  and continued weakening of women s fashion accessory trends resulted in million fewer sales of belts and million fewer sales of small leather goods 
the lower belt sales include the million effect of a customer discontinuing its fashion belt program 
gross margins for each of our segments generally were lower as the result of lower sales and the million inventory write down 
the margin percentage of net sales for our men s accessories segment in fiscal was 
table of contents percentage points lower than fiscal  including the percentage point effect of the segment s million inventory write down 
the women s accessories segment fiscal margin percentage was percentage points lower than fiscal  including a million inventory write down having a percentage point affect on the segment s margin 
our gross margin percentages also are affected by direct shipments as they have lower gross margins because these goods are shipped from our suppliers to our customers and are not handled in our distribution centers  thereby reducing the general and administrative costs related to the sales 
any material changes in sales mix  such as higher mass merchant accessory sales or direct shipments  could lower our gross margin percentages during a particular season 
operating expenses fiscal sg a expenses were million  or lower  than fiscal due primarily to the women s accessories segment having lower payroll  distribution costs  and royalty expense 
fiscal includes million in restructuring costs closing west bend  wisconsin distribution facility  terminating staff at other locations  remaining rent under a lease for a vacated office  other initiatives 
fiscal sg a expenses included  related to transitioning our yoakum  texas manufacturing operations to overseas suppliers and other severance costs 
the following were the more significant expense reductions in fiscal compared to the prior year in thousands contract labor market value of compensation plans investments distribution costs travel advertising legal increased investor relations expenses  related to our annual meeting and directors share based compensation  partially offset the expense reductions 
the fiscal compensation for our executive officers did not increase significantly as  based on our financial performance  our board of directors determined that for fiscal our president and chief executive officer s salary would remain at the prior year level  salary increases for our other executive officers would be minimal  equity compensation awards would not be granted to our executive officers  and no bonuses would be paid to our executive officers 
fiscal operating expenses include charges of million for the impairment of our men s accessories segment goodwill million and customer lists million as we significantly revised projections of our future operating results in light of changing business conditions and lower fiscal sales 
interest  other income  and taxes interest expense for fiscal includes  of costs related to a debt covenant waiver we received for the first quarter and  related to costs previously capitalized for the credit facility with our previous lenders 
other income includes interest and royalty income and  in fiscal  a  gain from the sale of the rights to use one of our trademarks in mexico 
as a result of the net loss in fiscal  we will receive an estimated million tax refund after filing our tax return 
approximately million of the fiscal loss will be available to reduce taxable income through our effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  the benefit of the federal statutory rate applied to our pretax loss was offset by a deferred tax valuation allowance and goodwill impairment which is not tax deductible 
the valuation allowance was recorded as our operating results over the past three years and revised projections of future operating results do not currently indicate it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was greater than the statutory rate due to state income taxes and expense deduction limitations which accounted for and of the difference  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this difference is due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventories which provided cash of million in fiscal while their increases in fiscal used cash of million 
due to the timing of inventory purchases for the fall and the holiday season  accounts payable decreased million in fiscal and increased million in fiscal to bridge the timing gap between inventory purchases and collection of accounts receivable  our credit facility provides us with funds on a revolving basis 
in fiscal periodic borrowings totaled million and repayments totaled million 
in fiscal  periodic borrowings totaled million and repayments totaled million 
capital expenditures for property and equipment of  were sharply below the million in fiscal which was primarily in support of inventory management  other computer related functions  and sales office remodeling 
the property and equipment expenditures in fiscal were partly offset by  in proceeds from selling the rights to use one of our trademarks in mexico 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility which we believe can provide adequate financial resources for our future working capital needs 
other financing activities in fiscal included  from the sale of common stock to employees through our stock purchase program and the exercise of stock options 
based on the strength of our balance sheet  we increased our quarterly dividend rate from to per share beginning with the fiscal fourth quarter payment 
we paid dividends totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
information about our credit facility is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at june  we had  in outstanding borrowings and could borrow an additional million 
as our borrowings increase for the procurement of fall and holiday season inventory  we may need to request modifications to the eligible inventory and accounts receivable borrowing limitations under our credit facility for part of the first half of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances sales are recognized when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowance for doubtful accounts in thousands except 
table of contents per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in allowance for doubtful accounts inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes the direct cost of purchased products and  for manufactured products  materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor the accumulation of excess inventory at the end of each season 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values at or above the lower of cost or market values at which we carry our inventories 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown is estimated and charged to expense in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
we closely monitor fashion trend items and anticipate additional inventory markdowns if market indications justify further markdowns 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our june  inventory would be in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory markdown uncertain tax positions beginning in fiscal  tax liabilities  together with interest and applicable penalties  are recognized for the benefits of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which more likely than not may not be realized as required by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
 a clarification of the accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we review the appropriateness of items of revenue or expense excluded or included in our tax returns and the requirements for filing returns with jurisdictions which may have laws requiring us to file tax returns 
failure to recognize a tax liability for the benefits of an uncertain tax position which ultimately is not realized could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates and  for performance units  reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
our estimated fair values would be greater if the expected dividend yield was decreased and the other assumptions were increased 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits we may realize
