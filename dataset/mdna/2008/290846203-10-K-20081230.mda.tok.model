our products provide our customers with high frequency and dynamic range  compact form factor  and extreme temperature  shock and vibration tolerance 
photovoltaics we believe our high efficiency compound semiconductor based multi junction solar cell products provide our customers with compelling cost and performance advantages over traditional silicon based solutions 
these advantages include higher solar cell efficiency allowing for greater conversion of light into electricity as well as a superior ability to withstand extreme heat and radiation environments 
these advantages enable a reduction in a customer s solar product footprint by providing more power output with less solar cells  which is an enhanced benefit when our product is used in concentrating photovoltaic cpv systems 
our photovoltaics segment primarily targets the following markets satellite solar power generation we are a leader in providing solar power generation solutions to the global communications satellite industry and us government space programs 
a satellite s operational success and corresponding revenue depend on its available power and its capacity to transmit data 
we provide advanced compound semiconductor based solar cells and solar panel products  which are more resistant to radiation levels in space and generate substantially more power from sunlight than silicon based solutions 
space power systems using our multi junction solar cells weigh less per unit of power than traditional silicon based solar cells 
our products provide our customers with higher conversion efficiency for reduced solar array size and launch costs  higher radiation tolerance  and longer lifetime in harsh space environments 
we design and manufacture multi junction compound semiconductor based solar cells for both commercial and military satellite applications 
we currently manufacture and sell one of the most efficient and reliable  radiation resistant advanced triple junction solar cells in the world  with an average beginning of life efficiency of 
emcore is in the final stages of qualifying the next generation high efficiency multi junction solar cell platform for space applications and this product family will have an average conversion efficiency of  providing our customers with expanded capability 
additionally  we are developing an entirely new class of advanced multi junction solar cell with even higher conversion efficiency 
this new architecture  called inverted metamorphic imm  is being developed in conjunction with the national renewable energy laboratory and the us air force research laboratory and to date has demonstrated conversion efficiency of exceeding on an r d scale 
emcore is also the only manufacturer to supply true monolithic bypass diodes for shadow protection  utilizing several emcore patented methods 
emcore also provides covered interconnect cells cics and solar panel lay down services  giving us the capability to manufacture fully integrated solar panels for space applications 
we can provide satellite manufacturers with proven integrated satellite power solutions that considerably improve satellite economics 
satellite manufacturers and solar array integrators rely on emcore to meet their satellite power needs with our proven flight heritage 
the pictures below represent a solar cell and solar panel used for satellite space power applications 
terrestrial solar power generation solar power generation systems utilize photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight to electricity and have been used in space programs and  to a lesser extent  in terrestrial applications for several decades 
the market for terrestrial solar power generation solutions has grown significantly as solar power generation technologies improve in efficiency  as global prices for non renewable energy sources ie  fossil fuels continue to rise over the long term  and as concern has increased regarding the effect of carbon emissions on global warming 
terrestrial solar power generation has emerged as one of the most rapidly expanding renewable energy sources due to certain advantages solar power holds over other energy sources  including reduced environmental impact  elimination of fuel price risk  installation flexibility  scalability  distributed power generation ie  electric power is generated at the point of use rather than transmitted from a central station to the user  and reliability 
the rapid increase in demand for solar power has created a growing need for highly efficient  reliable  and cost effective concentrating solar power systems 

table of contents emcore has adapted its high efficiency compound semiconductor based multi junction solar cell products for terrestrial applications  which are intended for use with concentrator photovoltaic cpv systems in utility scale installations 
emcore has attained peak conversion efficiency under x illumination on its terrestrial concentrating solar cell products in volume production 
this compares favorably to typical efficiency of on silicon based solar cells and approximately for competing multi junction cells 
we believe that solar concentrator systems assembled using our compound semiconductor based solar cells will be competitive with silicon based solar power generation systems  in certain geographic regions  because they are more efficient and  when combined with the advantages of concentration  we believe will result in a lower cost of power generated 
our multi junction solar cell technology is not subject to silicon shortages  which have led to increasing prices in the raw materials required for silicon based solar cells 
while the terrestrial power generation market is still developing  we are currently shipping production orders of cpv components to several solar concentrator companies  and providing samples to many others  including major system manufacturers in the united states  europe  and asia 
we have finished installations of a total of approximately megawatt mw cpv systems in spain  china  and us with our own gen ii design as shown in the picture above 
emcore has recently responded to several rfps from public utility companies in the us for a total of several hundred mws using its gen iii design 
the gen iii product  with enhanced performance including a module efficiency of approximately and much improved cost structure  is scheduled to be in volume production by the second half of calendar we are committed to the ongoing evaluation of strategic opportunities that can expand our addressable markets and strengthen our competitive position 
where appropriate  we will acquire additional products  technologies  or businesses that are complementary to  or broaden the markets in which we operate 
we plan to pursue strategic acquisitions  investments  and partnerships to increase revenue and allow for higher overhead absorption that will improve our gross margins 
recent acquisitions include on february   emcore acquired telecom related assets of intel corporation s optical platform division opd that included inventory  fixed assets  intellectual property  and technology comprised of tunable lasers  tunable transponders  pin transponders  and integrated tunable laser assemblies 

table of contents on april   emcore acquired the enterprise and storage related assets of intel corporation s opd business  as well as intel s connects cables business 
the assets acquired include inventory  fixed assets  intellectual property  and technology relating to optical transceivers for enterprise and storage customers  as well as optical cable interconnects for high performance computing clusters 
all of these acquired businesses are part of emcore s fiber optics reporting segment 
please refer to risk factors under item a and financial statements and supplemental data under item for further discussion of these transactions 
emcore is committed to achieving profitability by increasing revenue through the introduction of new products  reducing our cost structure and lowering the breakeven points of our product lines 
we have significantly streamlined our manufacturing operations by focusing on core competencies to identify cost efficiencies 
where appropriate  we transferred the manufacturing of certain product lines to low cost contract manufacturers when we can lower costs while maintaining quality and reliability 
emcore s restructuring programs are designed to further reduce the number of manufacturing facilities  in addition to the divesture or exit from selected businesses and product lines that are not strategic and or are not capable of achieving desired revenue or profitability goals 
our results of operations and financial condition have and will continue to be significantly affected by severance  restructuring charges  impairment of long lived assets and idle facility expenses incurred during facility closing activities 
please refer to risk factors under item a and financial statements and supplemental data under item for further discussion of these items 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
management develops estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available 
emcore s reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to significant accounting policies  which are discussed below 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
emcore s most significant estimates relate to accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill  intangibles  other long lived assets  warranty accruals  revenue recognition  and valuation of stock based compensation 
valuation of accounts receivable 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable and accordingly maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk 
the company classifies charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as sg a expense 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate impacting their ability to pay us  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the standard cost method 
the company reserves against inventory once it has been determined that i conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose  ii the inventory s value is determined to be less than cost  or iii the inventory is determined to be obsolete 
the charge related to inventory reserves is recorded as a cost of revenue 
the majority of the inventory write downs are related to estimated allowances for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value and on excess raw material components resulting from finished product obsolescence 
in most cases where the company sells previously written down inventory  it is typically sold as a component part of a finished product 
the finished product is sold at market price at the time resulting in higher average gross margin on such revenue 
the company does not track the selling price of individual raw material components that have been previously written down or written off  since such raw material components usually are only a portion of the resultant finished products and related sales price 
the company evaluates inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part by part basis  in addition to determining its overall inventory risk 
reserves are adjusted to reflect inventory values in excess of forecasted sales  as well as overall inventory risk assessed by management 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  charges to write down our inventory 
while we believe  based on current information  that the amount recorded for inventory is properly reflected on our balance sheet  if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  our future sales mix differs from our forecasted sales mix  or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 

table of contents valuation of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business or assets over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
management has elected december as its annual assessment date 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is attributed 
as of december  and  we tested for impairment of our goodwill and based on that analysis  we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting units did not exceed their fair value  and therefore  no impairment was recognized for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   due to the recent decline in the company s stock price and economic downturn  we tested again for impairment of our goodwill 
based on that analysis  we determined that an impairment of million should be recognized for the period ended september  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we ve experienced further price decline in our common stock 
accordingly  an impairment test will be performed on our annual schedule and further impairment is likely to result 
valuation of long lived assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of our property  plant  and equipment 
other intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property that has been internally developed or purchased 
purchased intangible assets include existing and core technology  trademarks and trade names  and customer contracts 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years 
because all of intangible assets are subject to amortization  the company reviews these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company reviews long lived assets and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset or other intangible asset is considered impaired when its anticipated undiscounted cash flow is less than its carrying value 
in making this determination  the company uses certain assumptions  including  but not limited to a estimates of the fair market value of these assets  and b estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service that assets will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
as of september   due to the recent decline in the company s stock price and economic downturn  we tested for impairment of our long lived assets and other intangible assets and based on that analysis  we determined that no impairment was recognized for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements 
product warranty reserves 
the company provides its customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for certain products 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  the company makes estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates as a percentage of revenue and accrues estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our historical experience of known product failure rates  use of materials to repair or replace defective products and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product issues 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from a customer  the price is fixed  the product meets its specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
in those few instances where a given sale involves post shipment obligations  formal customer acceptance documents  or subjective rights of return  revenue is not recognized until all post shipment conditions have been satisfied and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board fob or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that the company fulfills its delivery obligation when the goods are handed over to the freight carrier at our shipping dock 
this means the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods from that point 
in certain cases  the company ships its products cost insurance and freight cif 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fca shipping point terms  but the company pays and bills the customer for the cost of shipping and insurance to the customer s designated location 
the company accounts for shipping and related transportation costs by recording the charges that are invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in those instances where inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized only when our customer pulls product for its use and title and ownership have transferred to the customer 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
the company also generates service revenue from hardware repairs and calibrations that is recognized as revenue upon completion of the service 
any cost of warranties and remaining obligations that are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized 
distributors the company uses a number of distributors around the world 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to these distributors 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributors upon shipment  and our distributors are contractually obligated to pay the company on standard commercial terms  just like our other direct customers 
the company does not sell to its distributors on consignment and  except in the event of product discontinuance  does not give distributors a right of return 
solar panel and solar power systems contracts the company records revenues from certain solar panel and solar power systems contracts using the percentage of completion method in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized in proportion to actual costs incurred compared to total anticipated costs expected to be incurred for each contract 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made for the total loss anticipated 
the company has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
the company uses all available information in determining dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues  and contract costs 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
due to the fact that the company accounts for these contracts under the percentage of completion method  unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or accounts billed after the period end 
government r d contracts r d contract revenue represents reimbursement by various us government entities  or their contractors  to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that the company may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the us government to practice the inventions for governmental purposes 
the r d contract funding may be based on a cost plus  cost reimbursement  or a firm fixed price arrangement 
the amount of funding under each r d contract is determined based on cost estimates that include both direct and indirect costs 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set margin 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record revenue 
contract costs include material  labor  special tooling and test equipment  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
an r d contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred  milestones have been reached  and any reporting obligations to the customer have been met 
government contract revenue is primarily recognized as service revenue 
the company also has certain cost sharing r d arrangements 
under such arrangements in which the actual costs of performance are divided between the us government and the company on a best efforts basis  no revenue is recorded and the company s r d expense is reduced for the amount of the cost sharing receipts 

table of contents the us government may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience  we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs 
if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default  generally the us government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract items  net of the work accepted from the original contract 
the us government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default 
stock based compensation 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model and the straight line attribution approach to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r  share based payment revised 
the company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r and accordingly prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered beginning on october   the first day of the company s fiscal year the option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
emcore s expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
the expected stock price volatility is based on emcore s historical stock prices

significant customers as a percentage of total consolidated revenue fiber optics related customers customer a customer b customer c customer d photovoltaics related customer customer e as of september   we had an order backlog of approximately million compared to million in the prior year 
our order backlog is defined as purchase orders or supply agreements accepted by the company with expected product delivery and or services to be performed in the future 
the september  order backlog is comprised of million related to our photovoltaics segment of which million is expected to be delivered subsequent to fiscal and million related to our fiber optics segment expected to be delivered in the fiscal on december   emcore announced that it had received a purchase order to supply megawatts of cpv  along with a letter of intent for follow on projects of mw  from di semicon  a south korean semiconductor packaging company  and that it had also executed an agreement with the same company relating to the formation of a joint venture in south ever korea to manufacture cpv systems in south korea 
no amounts from this order were included in emcore s backlog  and  due to di semicon s inability to obtain necessary financing  emcore no longer expects any product orders from  or other arrangements with  di semicon to result in the foreseeable future 
from time to time  our customers may request that we delay shipment of certain orders and our backlog could also be adversely affected if customers unexpectedly cancel purchase orders that we ve previously accepted 
a majority of our fiber optics products typically ship within the same quarter as when the purchase order is received  therefore  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended september  and consolidated revenue emcore s consolidated revenue increased million  or  to million from million  as reported in the prior year 
international sales increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
government contract revenue  which is primarily service revenue  decreased million  or  to million from million  as reported in the prior year 
a comparison of revenue achieved within each of emcore s reporting segments is as follows 
fiber optics over the past several years  communications networks have experienced dramatic growth in data transmission traffic due to worldwide internet access  e mail  and e commerce 
as internet content expands to include full motion video on demand  hdtv  multi channel high quality audio  online video conferencing  image transfer  online multi player gaming  and other broadband applications  the delivery of such data will place a greater demand on available bandwidth and require the support of higher capacity networks 
the bulk of this traffic  which continues to grow at a very high rate  is already routed through the optical networking infrastructure used by local and long distance carriers  as well as internet service providers 
optical fiber offers substantially greater bandwidth capacity  is less error prone  and is easier to administer than older copper wire technologies 
as greater bandwidth capability is delivered closer to the end user  increased demand for higher content  real time  interactive visual and audio content is expected 
we believe that emcore is well positioned to benefit from the continued deployment of these higher capacity fiber optic networks 
major customers for the fiber optics segment include alcatel lucent  aurora networks  bupt guoan broadband  c cor electronics  ciena  cisco  fujitsu  hewlett packard  huawei  ibm  intel  jabil  jdsu  merge optics  motorola  network appliance  sycamore networks  inc  tellabs  and zte

we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal  net loss of million in fiscal  and net income of million in fiscal fiscal results included the sale of our gelcore joint venture that resulted in a net gain  before tax  of million 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will not continue to experience net losses for the foreseeable future 
although our revenue has grown in recent years  we may be unable to sustain such growth rates if there are adverse changes in market or economic conditions 
if we are not able to increase revenue and or reduce our costs  we may not be able to achieve profitability 
at september   cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted cash totaled approximately million 
historically  the company has consumed cash from operations 
during fiscal  we consumed cash from operations of approximately million  with the rate of cash consumption declining in the third and fourth quarters 
historically  we have addressed our liquidity requirements through a series of cost reduction initiatives  capital markets transactions and the sale of assets 
as of september   we had approximately million in working capital 
although we expect our operating performance to improve in future periods  we anticipate that the recession in the united states and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world may create a more challenging business environment for us in the near term 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management actions and plans recently  we have revised the assumptions underlying our operating plans and recognized that additional actions were needed to position our operations to minimize cash usage 
accordingly  we undertook a number of initiatives aimed at conserving or generating cash on an incremental basis through the end of these initiatives included business realignment  structural cost and headcount reductions  reduction of capital spending  a greater emphasis on managing our working capital  and certain asset sales 
in december  we announced an agreement to sell our non core equity interests for approximately million in cash 
in addition to these operational measures  we are actively pursuing a number of capital raising initiatives including the sale of a minority ownership position in the company s photovoltaics business as an initial step towards a potential spin off of the business 
in october  we announced the closing of a million secured credit facility with bank of america and  in november  the company sold million of our auction rate securities at par value with the remaining million in auction rate securities expected to be settled at par value by june these initiatives are intended to conserve or generate cash in response to the deterioration in the global economy so that we can preserve adequate liquidity through december however  the full effect of many of these actions will not be realized until later in  even if they are successfully implemented 
we are committed to exploring all of the initiatives discussed above and there is no assurance that capital markets conditions will improve within that time frame 
our ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent on the successful execution of many of the actions referred to above within the timeline contemplated by our plans 
conclusion if cash generated from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient to satisfy emcore s liquidity requirements  emcore will seek to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
due to the unpredictable nature of the capital markets  additional funding may not be available when needed  or on terms acceptable to emcore 
if emcore is required to raise additional financing and if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  our ability to continue to fund expansion  develop and enhance products and services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be severely limited 
such a limitation could have a material adverse effect on emcore s business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow

due to the fact the company believes that it will receive full value of its remaining million securities  we have not recorded any impairment on these investments as of september  if we are unable to liquidate and settle these auction rate securities on favorable terms and conditions  such liquidity limitations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow

to reduce the impact of these risks on the company s earnings and to increase the predictability of cash flows  the company uses natural offsets in receipts and disbursements within the applicable currency as the primary means of reducing the risk 
some of our foreign suppliers may adjust their prices in us from time to time to reflect currency exchange fluctuations  and such price changes could impact our future financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency exposure 
interest rates
