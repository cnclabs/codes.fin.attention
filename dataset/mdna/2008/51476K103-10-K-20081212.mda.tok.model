critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the majority of the services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly or quarterly that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment and other assets plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  and thirty months to five years for other assets 
landauer assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
landauer capitalizes  as a component of equipment  internal software costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
such costs amounted to   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and in fiscal year  approximately  of the capitalized software costs were related to the company s initiative to re engineer various business processes and replace components of its information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
the new software is replacing certain legacy assets that were either subject to immediate impairment or retirement once the full system implementation has been completed 
in fiscal year  the remainder of the costs was related to legacy assets  some of which were included in the evaluation for immediate impairment or retirement 
information regarding these costs is contained under the footnote impairment and accelerated depreciation charges on page of this annual report on form k 
goodwill and other intangible assets landauer s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents and goodwill  an asset with an indefinite life 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe and sapra landauer as well as other smaller investments 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
under sfas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  generally  must be performed annually and based on fair values 
the company s methodology for testing goodwill for impairment includes a review of potential impairment triggering events  financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by investment  and tests of fair market value 
as a result of applying the impairment provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment loss was required as of september  information regarding the value of goodwill and other intangible assets is presented under the footnote goodwill and other intangible assets on page of this annual report on form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company estimates the income tax provision to record for the current year  and records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences in tax consequences between the financial statements and tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
management exercises significant judgment in its assessment of the probability of realization of and the appropriate value of the deferred items pursuant to fin no 
s more likely than not criteria 
management considers  among other factors  the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  and tax planning strategies 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
the company assesses and updates its tax positions when significant changes in circumstances  which would cause a change in judgment about the likelihood of realizing the deferred items  occur 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes on page of this annual report on form k 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for the company s defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
the weighted average assumed discount rate used to determine the fiscal plan expenses was compared to for fiscal for fiscal expense  the expected long term rate of return of plan assets was  unchanged from fiscal in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
in determining the rate of compensation increase of for fiscal and  management considered historical company increases  market expectations and expected future company increases 
the weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at september  were a discount rate of compared to the fiscal rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september   and a rate of compensation increase of  unchanged from fiscal effective september   the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
the statement requires the recognition of a plan s funded status on the company s balance sheet 
previously unrecognized transactions and events affecting the plan s funded status are recognized as components of the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
these components will continue to be modified as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated statement of income 
the statement also requires that plan measurement dates coincide with the company s fiscal year end 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not impact the company s plan measurement dates  as its plans historically have used a plan measurement date of september an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
information regarding these plans is contained under the footnote employee benefit plans on page of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation effective october   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all stock based awards  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
the fair values of options granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r were estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
key input assumptions used in this model to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected option term  the expected volatility of the company s stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s term and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatility and the expected life of stock options were based on historical experience 
the risk free interest rate was derived from the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term  as of the date of grant  equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield was based on annual dividends and the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
no options have been granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition to stock options  key employees and or non employee directors are eligible to receive performance shares and restricted stock 
the terms of performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is recognized based on management s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis the progress towards achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revised estimate 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of awards to be estimated at the time of grant as stock based compensation cost should be recognized only for those awards expected to vest 
the company uses historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures 
the company recognizes the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the forfeiture rate  or actual forfeitures  as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revision 
if revisions are made to management s assumptions and estimates or if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected  stock based compensation expense could change significantly  impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
further information regarding the company s stock based awards is presented under the footnote stock based compensation on page of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of the company s international subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the functional currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets and markets becomes more volatile 
the company estimates that a and adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased reported net income in fiscal by approximately  and  respectively 
historically  the company believes that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially impacted its financial condition 
the company does not have significant trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
therefore  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non us operations or for trading or speculative purposes
