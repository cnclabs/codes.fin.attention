title to interests as is customary in our industry  a preliminary review of title records is made at the time we acquire properties  which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or counsel 
we believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry  subject only to immaterial exceptions which do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations 
the interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty  overriding royalty  and other outstanding interests including disputes related to such interests customary in the industry 
the interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws  ordinances  rules  regulations  and orders of arbitral or governmental authorities 
in addition  the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments  net profits interests  liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes  development obligations under oil and gas leases  and other encumbrances  easements  and restrictions  none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations 
item a 
risk factors our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks  including those described below 
if any of such events should occur  our business  financial condition  liquidity and or results of operations could be materially harmed  and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future 
our profitability is highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which have historically been very volatile our estimated proved reserves  revenues  profitability  operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and ngls  which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
historically  these prices have been very volatile  and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
a significant and extended downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow  and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and the amounts of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
to the extent that we have not hedged our production with derivative contracts or fixed price contracts  any significant and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely affects our financial position 
our commodity hedging may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
we cannot assure that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in crude oil or natural gas prices 
acquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted  while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors 
therefore  unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones  secondary recovery reserves or tertiary recovery reserves  or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced 
future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis 
furthermore  if oil or gas prices increase  our cost for additional reserves could also increase 
inherent risk in drilling drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including  but not limited to unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing  collisions and hurricanes  other adverse weather conditions  and increase in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment 
certain future drilling activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all drilling  whether developmental or exploratory  involves these risks  exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
risks arising from the failure to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves although we perform a review of the acquired properties that we believe is consistent with industry practices  such reviews are inherently incomplete 
it generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
ordinarily  we will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties and will sample the remainder 
however  even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties  and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results  particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations 
our north american operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations our north american operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 
international operations have uncertain political  economic and other risks our operations outside north america are based primarily in egypt  australia  the united kingdom and argentina 
on a barrel equivalent basis  approximately percent of our production was outside north america and approximately percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december  were located outside north america 
as a result  we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties that are more prevalent than our north american operations 
such factors include  but are not limited to general strikes and civil unrest  the risk of war  acts of terrorism  expropriation  forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts  import and export regulations  taxation policies  including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims  and investment restrictions  price control  transportation regulations and tariffs  constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  devaluation or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds  laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  including trade sanctions  the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate  the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states  and difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations 
foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes 
if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country  our interests could decrease in value or be lost 
even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management s attention from our more significant assets 
various regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability 
this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment 
in an extreme case  such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign owned assets 
this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities may have on the oil and gas industry in general  and on our operations in particular  is not known at this time 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities 
on december   apache entered into a year insurance contract with the overseas private investment corporation opic which provides million of political risk insurance for the company s egyptian operations 
this policy insures us against non payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production 
the company also purchases multi year commercial political risk insurance contracts from highly rated international insurers covering portions of its investments in egypt and argentina 
the insurance provides coverage for confiscation  nationalization  and expropriation risks and currency inconvertibility 
effective march   the company entered into an additional multi year insurance contract with opic to provide million of coverage for egypt in excess of the commercial insurance program 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs 
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects we are involved in several large development projects whose completion may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates 
our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners  timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  weather conditions  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and other unforeseen events 
delays and differences between estimate and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our forward looking statements related to large development projects  and our ability to participate in large scale development projects in the future 
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar with the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the british pound 
our financial statements  presented in us dollars  are affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
volatility in exchanges rates may adversely affect our results of operation  particularly by a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies 
weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity demand for oil and natural gas are  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or cyclones offshore australia  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 
while our planning for normal climatic variation  insurance program  and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather  not all such effects can be predicted  eliminated or insured against 
costs incurred related to environmental matters we  as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  are subject to various federal  provincial  state  local and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean up resulting from operations  subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages  and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
we have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements  which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations  including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business 
we also have established operational procedures and training programs designed to minimize the environmental impact of our field facilities 
apache manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability 
the costs incurred by these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate the expenses related to environmental matters  however  we do not believe any such additional expenses are material to our financial position or results of operations 
the company also conducts periodic reviews  on a company wide basis  to identify changes in its environmental risk profile 
these reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability  its amount  and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred 
the amount of any potential liability is determined by considering  among other matters  incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of our employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time to any possible remediation effort 
our general policy is to limit any reserve additions to incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding  we maintain insurance coverage  which we believe is customary in the industry  although we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
as described in note commitments and contingencies of item  in this form k  on december   we had an accrued liability of million for environmental remediation 
we have not incurred any material environmental remediation costs in any of the periods presented and we are not aware of any future environmental remediation matters that would be material to our financial position or results of operations 
although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry  generally these requirements do not appear to affect us any differently  or to any greater or lesser extent  than other upstream companies in the industry 
we do not believe that compliance with federal  provincial  state  local or foreign country provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of apache or its subsidiaries  however  there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact 
industry competition strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases  properties and reserves  equipment and labor required to explore  develop and operate those properties and the marketing of oil and natural gas production 
higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production  such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geo physicists  engineers and other specialists 
insurance does not cover all risks exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be hazardous  involving unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities  injury to persons  loss of life  or damage to property or the environment 
we maintain insurance against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be prudent  however  insurance is not available to us against all operational risks

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
executive overview apache corporation apache or the company is one of the largest independent non integrated oil and natural gas upstream companies in the united states us at apache  we strive to generate competitive returns and build a profitable oil and gas company for the long term benefit of our shareholders using the following strategy build a balanced portfolio of assets which provides a platform for profitable growth through drilling and acquisitions across the cycles of our dynamic industry  maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet  and maximize cash flow and earnings from each unit of production by controlling administrative  operating and capital costs 
a key part of our strategy is balancing our portfolio through diversity of geological risk  political risk  hydrocarbon mix crude oil versus natural gas and reserve life in order to achieve consistency in results 
our portfolio of geographic locations provides variation of all of these factors and  additionally  in the case of australia and argentina  the potential for increasing the value of our investments through rising natural gas prices 
we currently have operations in the united states central and gulf coast regions  canada  egypt  the united kingdom sector of the north sea  australia and argentina 
we are finalizing contracts for two exploration blocks in chile 
each region has a significant producing asset base as well as large undeveloped acreage positions which provide room for growth 
in  no single region contributed more than percent of our production or reserves 
we seek to maintain diversity of reserve life  which translates into balance in the timing of returns on our investments 
reserve life estimated reserves divided by annual production in our regions ranges from as short as six years to as long as years 
by maintaining a balanced hydrocarbon mix  we are protecting against price deterioration in a given product while retaining upside potential through a significant increase in either commodity price 
for example  in  oil and liquids provided percent of our production  but percent of our total oil and gas revenues 
we were well positioned to realize the benefit of higher oil prices  which significantly outpaced natural gas price increases 
at year end  our estimated proved reserves were also balanced at percent natural gas and percent crude oil and liquids 
additionally  in each region  we have attained a critical mass that supports sustainable lower risk drilling opportunities  balanced by higher risk  higher reward exploration 
in  we drilled  or participated in   gross wells with an overall percent success rate  percent were developmental and percent exploratory 
we believe our balanced portfolio strategy enhances our ability to deliver long term production growth  increase proved reserves at a reasonable economic cost and achieve competitive investment rates of return for the benefit of our shareholders 
our management and incentive systems underscore high cash flow and appropriate risk taking to reach or exceed targeted hurdle rates of return on invested capital 
these are measured monthly  reviewed with management quarterly and utilized to determine annual performance awards 
we review capital allocations  at least quarterly  through a disciplined and focused process of reviewing internally generated drilling prospects  opportunities for tactical acquisitions  land positions with additional drilling prospects or  occasionally  new core areas which could enhance our portfolio 
we continue to deliver strong results with return on capital employed and return on equity of percent and percent  respectively 
also in  we increased reserves for the nd consecutive year and production for the th of the last years  a testament to our balanced portfolio approach 
we periodically evaluate our properties to determine whether sales of certain assets could provide opportunities to redeploy our capital resources to rebalance our portfolio and enhance prospective returns 
as a result of this process  in we sold non strategic oil and gas properties located in northwest louisiana for approximately million and contracted to sell others for approximately million 
the assets under contract are expected to close in the first quarter of preserving financial flexibility is key to our overall business philosophy 
we ended with a year end debt to capitalization ratio of percent  despite current year capital investments of billion  excluding asset retirement costs 
in tightening credit markets  apache s single a debt ratings provide a competitive advantage in accessing capital 
the third critical component of our overall strategy is maximization of earnings and cash flow 
both are significantly impacted by commodity prices  our ability to economically add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  and controlling costs to add and produce reserves 
commodity prices fluctuate and are influenced by factors beyond our control  including worldwide supply and demand  political stability and governmental actions and regulations 
while historically high prices have increased our oil and gas revenues in  they also led to increased industry competition and consequently rising costs 
drilling  operating and administrative costs continue to increase from both inflationary pressures from higher commodity prices and the weakened us dollar 
we have experienced additional cost increases  particularly in the us  with higher demand resulting from activity to repair damage caused by the gulf of mexico hurricanes 
increased demand for producing oil and gas properties has also resulted in higher acquisition prices 
we closely monitor drilling and acquisition cost trends in each of our core areas relative to product prices and  when appropriate  adjust our capital budgets accordingly 
in addition  we actively seek to identify and pursue alternatives to maintain efficient levels of costs and expenses 
despite pressure from rising costs  pre tax margins were our second highest on record 
we calculate pre tax margins as follows pre tax margins in thousands  except margin income before income taxes barrels of oil equivalent produced margin per boe produced operating highlights we made considerable operational progress during the year which we believe adds to our platform for long term profitable growth 
key operational highlights include us central our billion acquisition of producing properties in the permian basin of west texas and a successful drilling program contributed to another year of growth with productions and reserves increasing and percent  respectively 
these acquired properties had an estimated mmboe at the end of and compliment our existing long lived permian basin assets 
us gulf coast in september  we executed a farm in agreement securing exploration and development opportunities in deep rights below the austin chalk on approximately  net acres 
our gulf coast region increased daily equivalent production percent upon restoration of final production outages from hurricanes katrina and rita  successful drilling and recompletion programs and a full year of production from properties acquired in june canada we drilled and tested one horizontal well and conducted long term production tests on two vertical wells in our ootla shale gas play in british columbia 
encouraged by our results  we acquired additional acreage in the play during the year  bringing our total position to  gross  net acres 
egypt we doubled our acreage position with a percent interest in four new concessions  adding million gross acres of exploration potential 
progress is being made on our salam gas plant expansion  which should be completed by the end of  adding approximately to million cubic feet per day mmcf d and  barrels per day b d of capacity net to apache 
we also continued expansion of several waterflood projects with further drilling and increased water injection capacity 
australia in we announced discoveries in the julimar  julimar east and brunello fields on australia s northwest shelf 
the discovery which could potentially be the largest field ever found by apache  will be further appraised in we own a percent working interest in the julimar brunello complex 
the pyrenees development  operated by bhp billiton bhp  was sanctioned in construction will begin in with development drilling to start in early this project is expected to commence production in early at an estimated net rate of  b d 
we executed a contract for a floating production storage and offloading vessel fpso that will be used in the million van gogh development in western australia s exmouth basin 
we own percent of the development  which was sanctioned in production is expected to come online in  adding an estimated  b d to our net production 
we sanctioned the construction of a pipeline and an onshore natural gas processing plant for our reindeer gas project in the field is slated to begin producing in the middle of at an estimated net rate of mmcf d 
in our average realized gas price increased percent  or 
per mcf  with considerable upward pressure on prices of newly contracted gas 
north sea significant investments in platform upgrades continued in with production averaging almost  b d  the forties remains apache s largest value field in terms of production  reserves  and cash flow 
argentina in apache completed  square kilometers of a nearly  square kilometer d seismic mega shoot in tierra del fuego 
the program will be completed in in december  apache announced that the first significant well drilled from a location identified in the three dimensional seismic survey in tierra del fuego began producing at a rate of approximately  b d and mmcf d from the lower cretaceous springhill sandstone 
in our average realized gas price increased percent  up 
per mcf 
chile in november  apache was awarded the exploration rights on two blocks comprising one million net acres in chile at a bid round 
this acreage is adjacent to our  net acres on the argentinean side of tierra del fuego and represents a natural extension of our expanding exploration and production operations 
apache is finalizing the contracts with the chilean government and plans to begin shooting d seismic in financial highlights in  records were achieved in the key financial measures of earnings  cash flow  revenues  production and year end estimated reserves 
financial highlights for relative to include record earnings of billion  up percent 
record cash provided by operating activities of billion  up percent 
record oil and gas revenues of billion  up percent 
record production of  boe per day  up percent 
record oil prices averaged per bbl  up percent  gas prices averaged per mcf  up three percent 
capital expenditures totaled billion  including billion for exploration and development excluding asset retirement obligations  billion for acquisitions and million for gathering  transmission and processing facilities 
record estimated reserves of billion barrels of oil equivalent  up six percent 
results of operations revenues for the year ended december  contribution contribution contribution revenues in thousands oil natural gas natural gas liquids total oil and natural gas prices our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
given the current tightly balanced market  small variations in either supply  demand  or both  can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while other economic factors could impact demand 
while the market price received for crude oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas  crude oil trades in a worldwide market 
generally  price movements for all types and grades of crude oil move in the same direction 
apache manages a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices using financial instruments 
in argentina  we are currently selling our oil in the domestic market 
the government imposed a sliding scale tax on oil exports which effectively limits the amount we are able to receive in the domestic market to a parity price equivalent to the price of exported crude oil after adjusting for export taxes 
effective november   the export tax regulations were further modified and now include a cap of per barrel when wti is or greater 
in tdf  the price cap applies but apache retains the percent value added tax collected from buyers  effectively increasing realized prices 
natural gas  which has a limited global transportation system  is more subject to local supply and demand conditions 
the majority of our gas sales contracts are indexed to prevailing local market prices 
apache uses a variety of strategies to manage our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices including fixed price contracts and derivatives 
apache primarily sells natural gas into four markets north america  which has a common market and where supply and demand are currently tightly balanced  creating a volatile pricing environment where most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices 
egypt  where the majority of our gas is sold to egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc under an industry pricing formula indexed to dated brent crude oil with a maximum price of per mmbtu 
apache has retained the previous gas price formula without a price cap until on up to gross mmcf d 
australia  which has a local market with mostly long term fixed price contracts that are periodically adjusted for changes in australia s consumer price index 
argentina  where we receive low government regulated pricing on a substantial portion of our production 
the volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category 
during the year  we realized an average price of 
per mcf on government regulated sales 
the majority of the remaining volumes were sold at market driven prices  in excess of per mcf at year end

oil revenues gas revenues for the year ended december  for the year ended december  united states canada north america egypt australia north sea argentina other international total year compared to year crude oil revenues apache s consolidated crude oil revenues totaled billion  billion above  with nearly equal contributions from an percent rise in production and a percent increase in our realized oil price 
on the whole  production increased an average  barrels per day b d  driven by the us which was up  b d 
crude oil price realizations averaged per barrel for the year  in the fourth quarter alone 
us oil revenues were up million to billion with million  or two thirds of the increase  attributable to a percent increase in production 
a percent increase in realized prices added the remaining million 
gulf coast production climbed percent to  b d  mainly on production restored from hurricane damaged properties  a full year of production from gulf of mexico properties acquired in june and successful drilling and recompletion activities 
central region production grew percent to  b d  with the addition of permian basin properties acquired from anadarko petroleum corporation anadarko in march and successful drilling and recompletion activities 
in egypt  crude oil revenues rose million  to billion  with increased production generating an additional million of revenues 
the balance of the increase in revenues  million  came from a percent increase in realized prices  which were up to per barrel 
daily production averaged  b d  up seven percent 
production gains were associated with development drilling in the khalda and matruh concessions as well as the east bahariya  umbarka  el diyur and north el diyur concessions 
australia s crude oil revenues of million increased percent  or million 
production was percent higher generating million of the increase 
production growth resulted from an additional interest acquired in the legendre field  completion of west cycad wells  and increased liquids from the bambra  wonnich deep  doric and lee gas wells 
australia s price realizations rose percent to per barrel  the highest in the company  generating an additional million of revenue 
argentina s oil revenues increased million to million  with over percent of the increase associated with percent higher production 
the year benefited from a full year of production from acquisitions made in  as well as successful drilling  workover and recompletion activity during the year 
higher volumes added million to revenues  with price increases adding million 
argentina s realized oil prices averaged per barrel  up seven percent from the prior year 
north sea oil revenues increased million to billion 
oil prices averaged per barrel  up percent  adding million in revenues 
production averaged  b d  down eight percent  reducing revenues by million 
production increases on three of our platforms were more than offset by declines from wells at the alpha and echo platforms while drilling operations were postponed for facility upgrades 
drilling operations on the alpha platform will resume in canada s oil revenues increased million to million  with a percent price increase mostly offset by a nine percent decline in production 
prices averaged per barrel  up from in production dropped in primarily because of natural decline resulting from a percent reduction in exploration and development capital invested in canada compared to china had no crude oil revenues in compared to million in the prior year  a result of our august asset divestiture and exit from china 
natural gas revenues apache s natural gas revenues increased percent  or million  to billion 
higher production contributed million of the additional revenues 
gas production averaged  mmcf d  up percent from natural gas prices increased

costs the table below compares our costs on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production boe basis 
our discussion may reference either expenses on a boe basis or expenses on an absolute dollar basis  or both  depending on their relevance 
year ended december  year ended december  in millions per boe depreciation  depletion and amortization oil and gas property and equipment other assets asset retirement obligation accretion lease operating expenses gathering and transportation severance and other taxes general and administrative expenses financing costs  net total year compared to year depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a the following table details the changes in dd a of oil and gas properties between and dd a in millions volume change rate change full cost dd a expense totaled billion  million more than production growth drove million of the increase  the remainder is a consequence of higher costs 
dd a per boe averaged  higher than as the costs to acquire  find and develop reserves continued to exceed our historical cost basis 
increasing costs also impact our estimates for future development of known reserves and estimates to abandon properties  both of which impact our full cost depletion rate 
dd a on other assets increased million to million with facilities coming online  in canada  egypt and the us a full year of dd a on assets acquired during in argentina also contributed to the year over year increase 
lease operating expenses loe loe is comprised of several components direct operating costs  repair and maintenance  ad valorem taxes  and workover costs 
direct operating costs are generally driven by commodity price levels  the type of commodity produced and the location of properties ie offshore  onshore  remote locations  etc 
rising commodity prices impact operating cost elements directly and indirectly 
they directly impact costs such as power  fuel  and chemicals which are commodity price based 
other items such as labor  boats  helicopters and materials and supplies are indirectly impacted as high prices increase activity and demand and thus  costs 
our operating costs increased percent in and percent in when compared to the prior year driven by increasing commodity prices 
our average realized commodity price per boe for was percent higher than  eight percent higher than  and percent higher than oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas 
oil and liquids were percent of our production in both and a significant portion of our ad valorem taxes are reserve based and increase when prices rise 
repair and maintenance costs are higher on offshore properties and in areas with remote plants and facilities 
all production in australia and the north sea and over percent from the us gulf coast region is from offshore properties 
workovers accelerate production  hence  they generally rise with commodity prices 
in addition  workover activity generally increases after acquisitions 
fluctuations in exchange rates impact the company s loe  with a weakening us dollar adding to per unit costs and a strengthening us dollar lowering per unit costs in our international regions 
in  the us dollar weakened  and two percent relative to the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the british pound  respectively 
the following discussion will focus on per unit costs which we believe to be the most meaningful measure for analyzing loe 
loe averaged per boe  an increase of 
almost two thirds of the increase was from additional workover activity  a weakening us dollar  hurricane repair activity  incentive based compensation 
and ad valorem taxes 
the remaining increase is the result of the inflationary impact of higher commodity prices on all other operating costs  as described above 
the us contributed 
to the 
per boe increase 
driving factors in the increase were additional hurricane repairs  more workover activity  acquired permian basin oil properties which carry a higher rate than our historical average  incremental incentive based compensation with apache s rising stock price  higher ad valorem taxes  and the inflationary impact higher commodity prices have on operating costs 
over two thirds of the increase in workover activity occurred on properties acquired in march  in the permian basin of west texas 
canada added 
per boe to the consolidated rate  
of which was attributed to a decline in relative production 
a weakening us dollar negatively impacted the rate an additional 
the balance of the increase related to higher levels of workover activity  higher ad valorem taxes  lease rentals  company labor 
and generally higher costs 
the north sea increased the consolidated rate 
per boe  the net impact of a 
per boe increase on a decline in production volumes and a reduction of 
on lower costs 
the benefit of decreases in diesel fuel consumption 
and lower turnaround expenses more than offset increases from the impact of the weakening us dollar  higher standby and supply boat costs 
and higher contract labor 
we are seeing the benefits of several years of facility upgrades to reduce the operating costs  including completion of our power generation ring 
australia increased the consolidated rate 
per boe over the increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in legendre  an oil field which carries a higher cost per barrel than our existing blended australian rate  and appreciation of the australian dollar relative to the us dollar two argentine acquisitions  in april and september  lowered the consolidated rate 
per boe 
the loe rate on these properties was lower than our existing consolidated rate 
egypt had no impact on the consolidated rate 
our exit from china increased the consolidated rate 
per boe 
gathering and transportation we generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements  both of which include a transportation charge 
one is a netback arrangement  under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser 
in this case  we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser 
alternatively  we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point  pay our own transportation to a third party carrier and receive a price with no transportation deduction 
in this case  we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs 
in both the us and canada  we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements 
in the north sea  we pay transportation to a third party carrier 
in australia  oil and natural gas are sold under netback arrangements 
in egypt  our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to egpc under netback arrangements  however  we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements 
in argentina  we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements 
the following table presents gathering and transportation costs we paid directly to third party carriers for each of the periods presented for the year ended december  in millions us canada north sea egypt argentina total gathering and transportation total gathering and transportation per boe these costs are primarily related to the portion of natural gas in our us and canadian operations sold under arrangements where we pay transportation directly to third parties  and north sea crude oil sales and our egyptian crude oil exports not sold under netback arrangements 
the million increase was driven primarily by us production growth  an increase in egyptian crude exports not sold under netback arrangements and a full year of transportation costs paid to third parties in argentina 
severance and other taxes severance and other taxes are primarily comprised of severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters in the us and australia  and the united kingdom uk petroleum revenue tax prt 
severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  while the uk prt is assessed on net receipts revenues less qualifying operating costs and capital spending from the forties field in the uk north sea 
we are subject to a variety of other taxes including us franchise taxes  australian petroleum resources rent tax  and various canadian taxes including freehold mineral tax  saskatchewan capital and saskatchewan resources surtax 
we also pay taxes on invoices and bank transactions in argentina 
the table below presents a comparison of these expenses for the year ended december  in millions severance taxes 
uk prt other taxes total severance and other taxes total severance and other taxes per boe severance and other taxes decreased million  or two percent  on an absolute basis 
on a per unit basis they decreased  or percent  reflecting the percent increase in equivalent production 
the increase in severance taxes was driven by higher production and prices on us and australian properties burdened by such taxes 
us prt was percent below  largely driven by lower comparable revenues on less production and slightly higher deductible costs 
deductible costs include capital expenditures  loe  general and administrative expenses g a  and transportation tariffs 
other taxes increased with a full year of taxes on invoice and bank transactions in argentina 
general and administrative expenses g a was million  or 
per boe  higher than incentive based compensation added

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in rate stemming from higher production 
financing costs  net the major components of financing costs  net  include interest expense and capitalized interest 
net financing costs for increased million or

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was billion  million above on both higher taxable income and a higher effective tax rate 
apache s effective tax rate was percent compared to percent in the effective rate was impacted by a non cash charge related to the effect of the weakening us dollar on our foreign deferred taxes 
partially offsetting this charge was an out of period benefit from canadian federal tax rate reductions enacted in the second and fourth quarters of the effective tax rate was impacted by a charge related to retroactive application of a percent increase in the oil and gas company supplemental tax enacted by the u 
k  a benefit from a canadian federal and provincial tax rate reduction enacted in the second quarter of and a gain recognized on the sale of china 
foreign currency fluctuations had a negligible impact on the rate 
year compared to year depreciation  depletion and amortization the following table details changes in dd a of oil and gas properties between and dd a in millions dd a volume change rate change dd a our full cost dd a expense totaled billion  million more than our full cost dd a rate of per boe was per boe more than  reflecting rising acquisition costs  higher abandonment cost estimates  rising industry wide drilling and finding costs  especially in the us and canada  and incremental future development costs associated with recent acquisitions and newly identified development projects 
the increase in costs  including increased estimates of future development costs  is related to increased demand for drilling and associated services  a consequence of both higher oil and gas prices and additional demand resulting from the ongoing need to repair damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in the increase in dd a  relative to was mitigated by a decline in egypt resulting from the january sale of egypt s deepwater acreage 
our full cost dd a expense was million lower because of the production shut in for hurricane damage 
depreciation of other assets increased million in  reflecting ongoing development of infrastructure in canada that began in to accommodate development on the acquired exxonmobil acreage  and the qasr field support facilities in egypt  including completion of the tarek gas plant inter connect 
lease operating expenses loe averaged per boe in  per boe higher than the hurricanes increased our worldwide rate by 
per boe in  a reflection of shut in production and additional expenses in excess of our insurance coverage 
the remainder of the increase was driven by industry wide cost increases  as discussed above  workover activity  a weaker us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound and higher non hurricane related repair costs in our us gulf coast and canadian regions 
the us added 
per boe to the worldwide rate 
the central region added 
per boe  with production growth nearly outpacing increases in costs  while the gulf coast region added 
per boe 
in addition to the impact of industry wide cost increases  activity levels soared in the gulf of mexico as producers continued to repair and restore production following the hurricanes 
this increase in demand on top of an already tight supply market for boats  helicopters  divers  labor  equipment and parts to complete repairs  pushed costs even higher in the region 
the region s loe included approximately million  or 
per boe  for repairs in excess of insurance coverage 
the rate increase was also impacted by additional workover activity  higher insurance rates and more non hurricane repair costs  relative to canada added 
per boe to the worldwide rate 
higher costs added 
per boe  while production growth reduced the rate 
the weakening us dollar accounted for 
per boe of the increase 
the balance related to a higher level of workover activity  higher repair and maintenance costs  reclamation and restoration projects undertaken during and the general rise in costs  including increases in power rates  contract labor and fuel 
egypt added 
to the worldwide rate as a million increase in costs  including increased workover activity  was mostly offset by associated production growth 
australia reduced the worldwide rate 
per boe with production growth more than offsetting associated incremental operating costs 
the north sea added 
per boe to the consolidated rate  with approximately two thirds of the increase in rate related to lower relative production  the strengthening british pound and an increase in pension liabilities 
the balance of the increase in costs related to major turnaround activity  higher fuel rates and usage as major projects were commissioned and higher maintenance and repair activity  relative to argentina reduced the consolidated rate

year ended december  in thousands exploration and development united states canada egypt australia north sea argentina china acquisitions oil and gas properties asset retirement costs capitalized interest gathering  transmission and processing facilities total capital expenditures exploration and development e d increases in our cash flows enabled us to invest larger amounts on e d capital projects during the year 
we invested billion on exploration and development activities in  up percent from our e d capital expenditures were million above in the us  we invested billion on exploration and development activities in our gulf coast region invested approximately billion on drilling  recompletions  and platform and production support facilities  including million of associated hurricane redevelopment capital in excess of insurance coverage 
the region drilled wells in the gulf of mexico and wells onshore  with a percent success rate  despite ongoing hurricane repair activity 
the central region had its most active year ever investing million  including the drilling of wells with a percent success rate 
the region added to its inventory of opportunities to grow production with the addition of permian basin properties from anadarko in the first quarter of canada s drilling program accounted for more than percent of the company s wells drilled 
the region invested million in on exploration and development activities and drilled wells with an percent success rate 
we invested million in the north sea on exploration and development drilling  recompletions and facility upgrades 
five of exploration and development wells drilled during were productive 
egypt had another active and successful exploration and development program investing million  drilling wells at an percent success rate 
in australia  we invested million in exploration and development activities as we participated in drilling wells  exploration wells and development wells 
three of the exploration wells and six of the development wells were productive for a success rate of percent 
in argentina our exploration and development activities increased by million over as we invested million drilling wells  three exploratory and development  with a percent success rate 
acquisitions we completed billion of acquisitions in compared to billion in acquisition capital expenditures occur as attractive opportunities arise and therefore  vary from year to year 
asset retirement costs in  we also recorded million of additional asset retirement costs 
the increase is primarily related to revisions of our cost estimates 
the continued escalation of service costs and the high level of abandonment activities in the gulf coast region have increased our expected obligations 
continued worldwide drilling programs and acquisition activity also contributed to the increased abandonment costs 
gathering  transmission and processing facilities gtp we invested million in gtp facilities in compared to million in in egypt we invested million on the expansion of gas processing facilities to alleviate the processing capacity bottleneck throttling deliverability 
in canada  we invested million in processing plants 
outlook we plan another active year of drilling 
because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions  year to year results and the relative levels of commodity prices and service costs  accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best 
at the end of  we had a fairly active drilling program underway  however  if commodity prices soften and service costs do not decline accordingly  apache will not hesitate to reduce activity until margins are back in line 
conversely  should commodity prices increase we may increase expenditures accordingly 
our preliminary plan includes exploration and development capital of approximately billion and gtp of approximately million 
we generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable 
we continually look for properties in which we believe we can add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise 
debt repayment the million apache finance pty ltd apache finance australia notes matured on december  the notes were repaid using funds borrowed on apache s commercial paper program 
repurchases of common stock on april   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock representing a market value of approximately billion on the date of announcement 
the company may buy shares from time to time on the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  or a combination of both 
the timing and amounts of any purchases will be at the discretion of apache s management 
the company initiated the purchase program on may   after the company s first quarter earnings information was disseminated in the market 
during  the company purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
no stock purchases were made in dividends the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
the company increased its quarterly cash dividend percent  to cents per share from cents per share  effective with the november dividend payment

liquidity at december  millions of dollars except as indicated net cash provided by operating activities total debt shareholders equity percent of total debt to capitalization floating rate debt total debt in recent years  our primary sources of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow 
additionally  we maintain revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow 
other available sources of capital and liquidity include the issuance of equity securities and long term debt 
during  another source of liquidity was the divestiture of our assets in china 
we expect the combination of these sources of capital will be more than adequate to fund costs and expenses necessary to maintain continued operations  future capital expenditures  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  dividends and other contractual obligations as discussed later in this section 
operating cash flow historically  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash provided by operating activities 
sales volume changes have also impacted operating cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices 
apache s long term operating cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each barrel produced must be replaced or the company  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink 
cash investments are continuously required to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves 
see item and  business and properties  risks factors  in this form k 
future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production will be highly dependent upon having adequate capital resources available  success in both exploration and development activities and acquiring additional reserves 
our year end reserve life index indicates an average decline of percent per year

as detailed above  the company currently has billion of syndicated bank credit facilities 
the available borrowing capacity under the credit facilities at december   after netting outstanding commercial paper  was billion 
the financial covenants of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than percent at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the negative covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to create liens and security interests on our assets  with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry  purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law  such as tax and mechanics liens 
the company may incur liens on assets located in the us  canada and australia of up to five percent of the company s consolidated assets  which approximated billion as of december  there are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the us  canada and australia 
there are also restrictions on apache s ability to merge with another entity  unless the company is the surviving entity  and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group 
there are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes mac clauses 
the credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings 
however  the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if apache corporation  or any of its us  canadian and australian subsidiaries  defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of million or has any unpaid  non appealable judgment against it in excess of million 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of december  credit ratings apache s senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated a by moody s  a by standard poor s and a by fitch 
apache s short term debt rating for its commercial paper program is currently p by moody s  a by standard poor s and f by fitch 
the outlook is stable from all three rating agencies 
oil and gas capital expenditures we fund exploration and development activities primarily through net cash provided by operating activities and budget capital expenditures based on projected operating cash flow 
our operating cash flow  both in the short and long term  is impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices  production levels  industry trends impacting operating expenses and our ability to continue to acquire or find high margin reserves at competitive prices 
for these reasons  management primarily relies on annual operating cash flow forecasts 
longer term operating cash flow and capital spending projections are rarely used by management to operate the business 
annual operating cash flow forecasts are revised monthly in response to changing market conditions and production projections 
apache routinely adjusts capital expenditure budgets in response to these adjusted operating cash flow forecasts and market trends in drilling and acquisitions costs 
we use a combination of our operating cash flow  borrowings under the our lines of credit and commercial paper program and  from time to time  issues of public debt or common stock to fund significant acquisitions 
contractual obligations we are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations 
these contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  see note commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further information regarding these obligations

apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur 
the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement  which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity 
such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation 
apache s management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations including approximately million for environmental remediation and approximately million for various legal liabilities 
see note commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s environmental and legal contingencies 
the company also accrued approximately million as of december   for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with oil insurance limited oil 
apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property  pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the company 
as part of its membership  the company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from oil 
apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool  however  the potential termination fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required 
off balance sheet arrangements apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions 
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of apache s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of apache s most critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting 
reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production sharing arrangements utilizing the economic interest method  which excludes the host country s share of reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
as such  our reserve engineers review and revise the company s reserve estimates at least annually 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
costs excluded under the full cost method of accounting  oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized amortization base 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the company s accounting  exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the amortization base upon completion of drilling individual wells 
if geological and geophysical g g costs cannot be associated with specific properties  they are included in the amortization base as incurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the amortization base or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the amortization base increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play 
this evaluation considers among other factors  seismic data  requirements to relinquish acreage  drilling results  remaining time in the commitment period  remaining capital plans  and political  economic  and market conditions 
impairments we assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment on a quarterly basis based on geological trend analysis  dry holes or relinquishment of acreage 
when impairment occurs  costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization 
impairments in international areas without proved reserves are charged to earnings upon determination that impairment has occurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve on a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated 
beginning in  we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from egpc for our egyptian oil and gas sales 
during  we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts 
we have not established a reserve for these egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid  albeit late  and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable 
asset retirement obligation aro the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
apache s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
aro  associated with retiring tangible long lived assets are recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable 
the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset 
the aro is recorded at fair value  and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in six countries 
as a result  we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company regularly assesses and  if required  establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates 
tax reserves have been established  and include any related interest  despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the company s tax returns 
these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits  case law and any new legislation 
the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 
derivatives apache uses derivative contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility 
the company accounts for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the estimated fair values of apache s derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
for foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs 
sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income  rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled 
realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in other under revenues and other of the statement of consolidated operations 
the fair value estimate of apache s derivative contracts requires judgment  however  the company s derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets 
as such  the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data 
option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  commodity risk in this form k for commodity price sensitivity information and the company s policies related to the use of derivatives 
stock based compensation stock compensation awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the required service period 
inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as the company s expected stock price volatility  expected term of the employee option  expected dividend yield  the expected risk free interest rate  the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant 
for option valuations  apache utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
for valuing the share appreciation plan awards  the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation model developed by a third party 
please refer to note capital stock of item of this form k for a detailed description of our stock compensation plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk 
the term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil  gas and ngl prices  interest rates  foreign currency  weather and climate  and governmental risks 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
the forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
commodity risk we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
apache historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions  however  in and  the company s board of directors authorized management to hedge a portion of production generated from the company s drilling program 
approximately percent of natural gas and crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges 
on december   the company had open natural gas derivative hedges in an asset position with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million  while a percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately million 
the company also had open oil derivatives in a liability position with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil prices would increase the liability by approximately million  while a percent decrease in prices would decrease the liability by approximately million 
these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  see note hedging and derivative instruments of item in this form k for notional volumes and terms associated with the company s derivative contracts 
apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy 
the risk management committee  comprising the chief financial officer  general counsel  treasurer and other key members of apache s management  approve and oversee these controls  which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department 
the treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities 
controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit  limits on volume  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
interest rate risk on december   the company s debt with fixed interest rates represented approximately percent of total debt 
as a result  the interest expense on approximately percent of apache s debt will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
a percent change in floating interest rates on year end floating debt balances would change annual interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
in australia  oil production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of the gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts 
over half the costs incurred for australian operations are paid in us dollars 
in canada  the majority of oil and gas production is sold under canadian dollar contracts 
the majority of the costs incurred are paid in canadian dollars 
the north sea production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of costs incurred are paid in uk pounds 
in egypt  all oil and gas production is sold under us dollar contracts and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in us dollars 
argentine revenues and expenditures are largely denominated in us dollars  but converted into argentine pesos at the time of payment 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds  egyptian pounds and argentine pesos are converted to us dollars equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period 
foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month 
currency gains and losses are included as either a component of other under revenues and other  or  as is the case when we re measure our foreign tax liabilities  as a component of the company s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations 
weather and climate risk demand for oil and natural gas are  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or cyclones offshore australia which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 
while our planning for normal climatic variation  insurance program  and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather  not all such effects can be predicted  eliminated or insured against 
governmental risk apache s us and international operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state  local and provincial laws and regulations impacting production levels  taxes  environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential windfall profits tax 
see item a risk factors  for further discussion 
forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  capital expenditure projections  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
