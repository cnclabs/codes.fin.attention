item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products  and metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and pet care markets  and a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations at compounded annual rates of percent and percent  respectively  over the past ten years  largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
acquisitions we acquired the white cap closures operations from amcor in europe in june  in turkey in july and in china and the philippines in december in january  we acquired majority ownership of the white cap closures operations in venezuela from amcor 
the acquisition of the remaining white cap operations in brazil is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
white cap is a leading supplier of an extensive range of vacuum closures to consumer goods packaging companies in the food and beverage industries 
white cap has been recombined with our previously acquired white cap closures operations in the united states to create a global leader in vacuum closures for hot filled and retortable food and beverage products 
at the respective closings  we paid an aggregate of million for white cap  including acquisition fees  net of cash actually acquired of million  financed primarily through euro borrowings under our credit agreement 
as part of the acquisitions  we assumed million of indebtedness 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of cousins currie  a leading manufacturer in canada of larger size custom designed plastic containers 
the purchase price of million was financed primarily with canadian dollar borrowings under our credit agreement 
in february  consistent with our strategy to pursue consolidation opportunities in the international vacuum closures market  we acquired vem  the metal vacuum closures operations of grup vemsa  sl  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  strengthening our position in the growing southern european and asian markets 

table of contents sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container  plastic container and closures businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past twenty years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top easy open ends 
we anticipate that the market will be relatively flat in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top easy open end  representing an increase in unit sales of this value added feature of percent since we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing sevenfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
with our acquisition in march of silgan white cap americas llc  our former closures joint venture with amcor in which we held a minority position  we became a leading manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
prior to our acquisition in march  this business was the north american business of the worldwide white cap business 
with our acquisition of white cap  we reunited these businesses and reestablished it as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  with leadership positions in the north american and european markets 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
in  we announced the closing of two metal food container manufacturing facilities and one plastic container manufacturing facility in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations  reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top easy open ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 

table of contents historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers such as our metal food container supply agreements with our three largest customers  nestl through for approximately percent of our sales to nestl  del monte through and campbell through 
we estimate that in approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales  a majority of our projected plastic container sales and a majority of our projected closures sales in the united sates will be under multi year arrangements 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in recent years  the steel industry in the united states announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher steel costs 
for our non contract customers  we also increased prices to pass through higher steel costs 
resin prices have also increased significantly in the past few years  and we have been able to increase prices to pass through increased resin costs in accordance with our supply arrangements 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
our closures business is also dependent  in part  upon vegetable and fruit harvests 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
in  we retained a significant amount of cash  increasing cash balances at year end to million 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we may use our cash flow to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted uses 
during  we borrowed million and cdn million of term loans under our credit agreement to finance our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie  respectively 
in addition  our credit agreement allows for an incremental loan facility of million  which may be borrowed in the form of term loans or  for up to million  in the form of revolving loans 
from through  we utilized available cash flow to pay down million of borrowings under our credit agreement 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness  or percent of our total outstanding indebtedness  which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to the full year impact from the acquisitions of the international closures operations and cousins currie  higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs  improved volumes in each business and favorable foreign currency translation 
income from operations in increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase in income from operations was due to stronger results across all three businesses and the impact of million lower rationalization charges versus net income in increased million to million

we recorded rationalization charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were the result of million lower rationalization charges in  benefits derived from ongoing cost reduction initiatives including from plant closings completed during the year  slightly higher unit volumes and improved manufacturing performance 
these benefits were partially offset by the negative cost impact in attributable to the reduction of provisional inventory as compared to the benefits of building this inventory in in anticipation of certain union negotiations which were completed in income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin increased primarily as a result of the impact of the cousins currie acquisition  a million reduction in rationalization charges in  improved volumes and the benefits of productivity improvements and cost reductions 
these benefits were partially offset by the negative effect of resin cost increases and the timing of the corresponding customer price pass through and a less favorable mix of products sold 
income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
the increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to the full year effect of the international closures acquisition  improved volumes and continued cost reductions across the closures business 
the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the inclusion for the full year of the international operations which generally incur selling  general and administrative expenses at a higher percentage of sales as compared to the domestic operations 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense for increased million to million as compared to this increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the cumulative prior year benefits of tax initiatives related to research and development tax credits recorded in  partly offset by lower statutory rates associated with the acquired international operations 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to the acquisition of the international closures operations and higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by lower volumes in the metal food and plastic container businesses 
income from operations in increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase in income from operations was primarily due to the acquisition of the international closures operations and strong operating performance in the domestic closures operations  partially offset by the impact of rationalization charges of million and lower unit volumes in the metal food and plastic container businesses 
net income in increased million to million 
our results included a tax benefit net of fees of per diluted share attributable to tax initiatives implemented during the year  as well as rationalization charges of per diluted share  net of tax 
net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of an increase in sales in our closures and metal food container businesses  partially offset by a decrease in sales in our plastic container business 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other inflationary costs  partially offset by lower food can volumes 
these volume declines were primarily due to poor growing conditions in california 
net sales for the plastic container business in decreased million  or percent  as compared to this decrease was principally a result of lower unit volumes  primarily as a result of the shutdown of our valencia  california manufacturing facility and inventory reductions at certain retailers 
this decrease was partially offset by higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
net sales for the closures business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was attributable to the acquisition of the international closures operations and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased percentage points to percent in as compared to percent in  due primarily to the inclusion of the international closures operations which incur such expenses at a higher percentage of its sales than our other operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses included million and million of tax professional fees for research and development and repatriation tax initiatives in and  respectively 
income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to  while operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
we recorded rationalization charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these decreases were principally due to the inclusion of rationalization charges recorded in for the exiting of the st 
paul  minnesota and stockton  california manufacturing facilities  a decline in unit volumes as a result of poor growing conditions in california and inflation in certain other manufacturing costs 

table of contents income from operations of the plastic container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin increased primarily as a result of the benefits of productivity improvements and headcount reductions and the benefit of declining resin costs during the first quarter of due to the timing of raw material cost pass throughs 
these improvements were partially offset by lower unit volumes and the inclusion of rationalization charges recorded in for the shut down of the valencia  california manufacturing facility 
income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were primarily due to the inclusion of seven months of operations of the european portion of the international closures acquisition and continued cost reductions in the domestic closures operations  offset by inflation in certain other manufacturing costs and higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales because the international operations incur such expenses at a higher rate as compared to the domestic operations 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense before the loss on early extinguishment of debt for increased million to million as compared to this increase resulted primarily from higher outstanding borrowings which were used to fund the acquisitions completed in and the effects of higher market interest rates 
in addition  in we incurred a non cash  pre tax charge of million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt primarily as a result of the refinancing of our previous senior secured credit facility in june provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the effective tax rate was impacted by the cumulative prior year benefits of tax initiatives related to research and development credits completed during the year  manufacturing credits available as a result of the american jobs creation act and the overall impact of a lower effective tax rate associated with the international operations 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments  including our credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
on june   we completed the refinancing of our million previous senior secured credit facility by entering into our new billion credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided us with million of a term loans and million of b term loans  and provides us with up to million and cdn million of revolving loans 
under the credit agreement  we may use revolving loans for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
the credit agreement also provides us with an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to an additional million  which may be used to finance acquisitions and for other permitted purposes 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
in  we borrowed cdn million of term loans under the credit agreement primarily to repatriate earnings of our canadian subsidiaries in connection with the american jobs creation act 
in  we borrowed million and cdn million of term loans under the credit agreement to fund our acquisitions of white cap and cousins currie  respectively 
term loans under our credit agreement are repayable in scheduled amounts through june  in addition to our mandatory repayments  we made voluntary prepayments of our term loans of million and million  respectively  in and

in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  the cash payment for this quarterly dividend is expected to be approximately million 
revolving loans under our credit agreement may be used for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed over the life of our credit agreement until their final maturity on june  at december  and  there were no revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
after taking into account letters of credit of million  borrowings available under the revolving loan facility of our credit agreement were million in us dollar equivalents on december  because we sell metal containers used in the fruit and vegetable packing process  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  and  the average amount of revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement  including seasonal borrowings  was million  million and million  respectively  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the highest amount of such borrowings was million  million and million  respectively 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our credit agreement for our peak seasonal working capital requirements  which range could be lower if we use any cash retained at the end of for working capital needs 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of to million  
table of contents principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in each of and and million in cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the notes  and payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which includes the benefits from the recent economic stimulus act of and which may increase annually thereafter 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 
the credit agreement and the indenture with respect to the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  
table of contents purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current tax law  there are no significant minimum required contributions to our pension plans in however  this is subject to change based on a number of factors  including in the event that asset performance is significantly below the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials subject to contractual lag periods for resin costs and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent and receive floating rates of interest based on three month libor or euribor  as required 
these agreements mature as follows million and million in  million and cdn million in  million in and million in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges in february  we approved and announced a plan to exit our valencia  california plastic container manufacturing facility 
the plan included the termination of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs 
this decision resulted in a total charge to earnings during of million  which consisted of million for employee severance and benefits  million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets and million for plant exit costs 
the plant has ceased operations and all cash has been expended 
in june  in an effort to streamline operations and reduce costs  we approved a plan to exit our st 
paul  minnesota metal food container manufacturing facility 
the plan includes the termination of approximately employees  the consolidation of certain operations into existing facilities and the elimination of the remaining operations and the exit of the facility 
we estimate that the total costs for the rationalization of this facility will be million 
these costs include million of non cash pension and postretirement curtailment expense  million of employee severance and benefits  including special termination benefits  million for plant exit costs  million for the acceleration of 
table of contents depreciation to write down the building for sale and equipment for abandonment upon the exit of the facility and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
total charges recognized during were million which consisted of million for non cash pension and postretirement curtailment expense  million for employee severance and special termination benefits and million for the non cash write down and accelerated depreciation of the building and equipment 
rationalization charges recognized during of million were comprised of million for employee severance and benefits which included million of non cash pension curtailment expense  million for plant exit costs and million for the non cash write down and accelerated depreciation of the building and equipment 
the facility is expected to cease operations in the first quarter of additional charges of million are expected through cash expenditures of million are expected primarily in in october  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our stockton  california metal food container manufacturing facility 
the plan includes the termination or relocation of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs 
we estimate total rationalization charges for the plan of million including million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets

in  we ceased operations in this facility 
additional charges of million are expected through for plant exit costs 
cash payments of million are expected in and beyond 
in addition  we expect to sell the stockton building in for estimated proceeds in excess of the net book value of the facility 
under these rationalization plans and other rationalization and acquisition plans initiated in previous years  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional cash spending of approximately million is expected for our plans  primarily in you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities in our business  including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings 
we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect 
table of contents demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we increased our domestic discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent in historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  utilizing the modified prospective transition method  which does not result in the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
therefore  for the year ended december  we recognized compensation expense based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after january  and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that were not vested on january  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position  cash flows or basic and diluted net income per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and  with respect to our international closures operations and our canadian plastic container operations  from foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our average outstanding total debt  respectively 
we manage a significant 
table of contents portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under the credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  we conduct a portion of our manufacturing and sales activity outside the united states  primarily in europe and canada

commodity pricing risk we purchase commodities for our products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during and  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our domestic exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december   we did not have any natural gas swap agreements outstanding 
you should also read notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account our natural gas swap agreements
