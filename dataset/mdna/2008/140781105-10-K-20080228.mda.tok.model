item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company conducts its business within two operating segments proppant and fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the company s principal business  the proppant segment  consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
through its fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment  the company provides fracture mapping and reservoir diagnostic services  sells fracture simulation software and provides engineering services to oil and gas companies worldwide 
these services and software are provided through the company s wholly owned subsidiary pinnacle technologies  inc the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
in recent years  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
in the company constructed its first manufacturing facility located outside the united states in the city of luoyang  china and completed a second production line in that doubled the capacity of that facility 
in  the company also opened a sales office in moscow  russia  and established distribution operations in the country 
in  the company broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the city of kopeysk  russia and completed construction of this new facility during the first half of the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 

table of contents revenue growth in recent years has been driven largely by increases in ceramic proppant sales volume  but fracture and reservoir diagnostic services are becoming an increasingly important part of revenue growth 
because ceramic proppant is used on less than percent of fractures worldwide  the company believes there is significant potential for growth in the future 
as a result  in recent years  the company has added significant new manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated future demand 
the company began producing product from a new manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia in january with the ability to operate at design capacity of million pounds per year 
construction of a second production line at the toomsboro facility was completed during the fourth quarter of and production started in january this second line added an additional million pounds of annual capacity 
the manufacturing facility in russia  completed during the first half of  is designed to have initial production capacity of million pounds per year 
as a result of these changes  the company has expanded its proppant manufacturing capacity by approximately over a three year period 
this expansion will be partially offset by the company s recently announced plans to idle production at its oldest manufacturing facility  located in new iberia  louisiana  during the first half of this facility has a designed production capacity of million pounds per year 
the idling of this plant will reduce production costs and is based on the rising cost of imported raw material and the small scale of that facility 
because the company s ceramic proppants compete in part against lower cost alternatives  the company expects its future revenue growth to be derived from increasing sales volume more so than from an increase in the selling price of ceramic proppant 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant 
as a result  the company has more than tripled its production capacity since although it is not currently constructing any new manufacturing capacity 
while the company has operated near or at full capacity at times during the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
operating profit margin for the company s proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  the company has experienced recent increases in the cost of natural gas  which is used in production by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  and bauxite  which is the primary raw material for production of the company s high strength ceramic proppant 
the cost of natural gas has varied from approximately to of total monthly direct production expense over the last three years due to price volatility of this fuel source 
during  market prices of natural gas increased sharply  peaking during the fourth quarter of that year 
as a result  the average price of natural gas delivered to the company s us manufacturing facilities increased during the fourth quarter of compared to the average price during the first three quarters of that year and remained high during much of in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company contracts in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements 
during the company s long standing contract with its supplier of high strength raw materials  which are imported into the us  expired 
the company has experienced an increase in the cost of high strength raw materials as it seeks alternative suitable suppliers in other parts of the world 
these materials are used to manufacture high strength products  carboprop and carbohsp  at the new iberia  louisiana and mcintyre  georgia facilities 
the delivered cost of bauxite  which represents approximately half of the cost of high strength products  increased during and could increase as much as to in as these costs are expected to continue to increase  management will continue to pursue a long term source of these materials to complement its strong position in lightweight raw material supplies 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices and the cost of high strength raw materials  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by these items  operating margins may decline and changes in net income may not directly correlate to changes in revenue 
as the company has expanded in international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  
table of contents improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  and focusing on new product development the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue  however selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may continue to increase in from levels as the company continues to expand outside of north america 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant or fracture and reservoir diagnostic services is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong from through as a result  the company experienced record demand for its products and services worldwide 
however  the company s ability to sell additional ceramic proppant was limited by its production capacity in and in and  the company benefited from the additional production capacity from its toomsboro  georgia manufacturing facility and established new records for sales volume  revenue and net income 
from through  the number of rigs actively drilling for oil and gas in the united states increased percent 
overseas drilling activity remained strong in and through  and the company saw an increase in sales volume in many regions outside of north america 
however  sales declined in the russian market in and compared to due to an increase in the availability of locally produced ceramic proppant and an increase in tariffs and freight surcharges on imported products 
with the completion of the new manufacturing facility in kopeysk  russia during the first half of  sales volume in the russian market for increased from that of the previous year 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues from both operating segments in  and  respectively 
the company s fracture and reservoir diagnostics business is also impacted by the level of global drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
in and this business benefited from increased acceptance and utilization of the company s fracture mapping services in unconventional natural gas formations and from the developing reservoir monitoring market 
the company believes that the demand for the services provided by its fracture and reservoir diagnostic business will increase as oil and gas production companies develop increasingly complex  unconventional reservoirs in north america and globally 
fracture and reservoir diagnostic services accounted for  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of collectability risk and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectability based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a 
table of contents prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by material amounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangibles  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
results of operations net income percent percent change change in thousands net income for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  a decline of compared to the previous year 
for the company experienced a increase in revenues  which represented the fifth consecutive year the company achieved a new revenue record 
the increase in revenues was offset by a decline in gross profit margin versus the previous year due to a number of factors including increased costs for high strength raw materials imported into the us  continued high manufacturing costs during the start up of the company s manufacturing facility in russia  increased field trial activity in which the company sells its products at a discounted price  and increased pricing pressure in certain international markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased to support higher operating and sales activity in an expanding global market 
in addition  start up costs in  related primarily to the start up of the company s manufacturing facility in russia  increased million from  when the company incurred costs associated with the completion and start up of the first production line in toomsboro  georgia 
interest income  net of interest expense  in declined million due to lower cash balances as a result of capital spending to add proppant manufacturing capacity 
finally  net income in benefitted from incremental gains of million from the appreciation of russian and

for the year ended december   the company reported record net income of million  greater than the million for the year ended december  and was the fourth consecutive year in which the company established a new record for net income 
net income increased mainly due to record revenues from both operating segments 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin versus the previous year primarily due to higher manufacturing costs in the proppant segment 
net income in also benefited somewhat from lower start up costs than experienced in  as the bulk of start up activities for the company s toomsboro manufacturing facility occurred in late individual components of financial results by operating segment are discussed below

proppant segment gross profit for was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for gross profit decreased million despite an increase of million in revenue 
the factors contributing to the decrease in the proppant gross profit from to are increased manufacturing and freight costs associated with the production and sale of high strength proppants  continued high production costs during the start up of the company s manufacturing facility in russia  increased field trial activity in which the company sells its products at a discounted price  and increased pricing pressure in certain international markets 
these increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in natural gas costs in the company s us manufacturing facilities 
although proppant segment gross profit margins as a percent of revenues declined three consecutive years  the company expects that the percentage in will be similar to that of fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment gross profit of million for increased by compared to gross profit of million for primarily due to the increase in revenue for this segment 
gross profit margin for this segment decreased slightly from in to in due to higher direct cost of sales related to long term reservoir monitoring projects and equipment sales 
proppant segment gross profit for was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for while gross profit in exceeded by due to higher sales volume  it decreased as a percentage of revenues due to increases in the costs of manufacturing and distributing finished goods 
the primary factors contributing to higher manufacturing costs were increases in the cost of natural gas consumed by the company s us plants and the cost of raw materials used to manufacture high strength ceramic proppant 
compared to  the company experienced a increase in the average price paid in for natural gas delivered to its us manufacturing facilities 
the cost of natural gas increased in the fourth quarter of when forward purchase contracts covering the company s gas requirements for its us plants expired  subjecting the company to market prices that had increased significantly during the year

the company believes its results will be influenced by the level of natural gas drilling in north america but expects its ability to demonstrate the value of ceramic proppant relative to alternatives will allow it to grow sales volume and revenue at a more rapid pace than the growth rate associated with drilling or fracturing activity 
the company believes its introduction of a new product carbohydroprop tm should help penetrate the market for sand based proppant in slickwater fracturing treatments 
given the levels of natural gas inventories in north america  the company believes there is the possibility of a short term contraction in drilling activity 
from an overseas perspective  the company believes the outlook for drilling and fracturing activity is more optimistic and expects the recent investments made in fixed assets and human resources necessary to expand its international presence to begin to show results
