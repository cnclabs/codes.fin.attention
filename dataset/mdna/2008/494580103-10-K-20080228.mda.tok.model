at december   our hospital division operated ltac hospitals with  licensed beds in states 
our health services division operated nursing centers with  licensed beds in states 
we also operated a contract rehabilitation services business which provides rehabilitative services primarily in long term care settings 
on july   we completed the spin off transaction 
see item business general spin off transaction and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in recent years  we have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations since the respective acquisition dates 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements

index to financial statements favorable settlements of prior year hospital medicare cost reports aggregated million in  million in and million in in addition  we recorded approximately million of income in related to prior year retroactive nursing center medicaid rate increases in indiana 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax credit of approximately million to reflect a change in estimate for hospital medicare in house accounts receivable and a pretax credit of approximately million to adjust certain nursing center medicaid revenues 
a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid private and other eliminations rehabilitation pharmacy collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients and customers 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to accounts receivable for certain hospitals acquired in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million favorable change in estimate related to the provision for doubtful accounts in our former pharmacy division 
allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through a wholly owned limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon management s best available information including third party actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
to the extent that subsequent expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 
provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon third party actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of in each of the last three years 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and ultimate actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect that professional liability costs for may be higher than the costs recorded over the last three years  we believe that our professional liability costs appear to be moderating 
with respect to our discontinued operations  we recorded a pretax charge aggregating million for and favorable pretax adjustments of million and million for and  respectively  resulting from a change in estimate for professional liability reserves related to prior years 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually

accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of annual taxable income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these

index to financial statements deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in november  the irs proposed certain adjustments to our and federal income tax returns which we contested 
the principal proposed adjustment related to the manner of reduction of our tax attributes  primarily our net operating loss carryforwards  in connection with the emergence of our subsidiaries and us from proceedings under the bankruptcy code 
in  we reached a settlement with the irs related to all disputed federal income tax issues for fiscal and in connection with the settlement  we paid approximately million of employer payroll taxes to the irs in at december   we reflected the impact of the settlement in our consolidated balance sheet by increasing certain net deferred tax assets by approximately million  reducing currently payable income taxes by approximately million and increasing stockholders equity by approximately million 
because of fresh start accounting rules related to our reorganization in  the settlement of these pre reorganization income tax matters had no impact on earnings in our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the effective income tax rate in was negatively impacted by million of non deductible expenses associated with the spin off transaction

we adopted the provisions of fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards that could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is uncertain that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we recognized net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  and million at december  after our emergence from bankruptcy  the realization of pre reorganization deferred tax assets and the resolution of certain income tax contingencies eliminated in full the goodwill recorded in connection with fresh start accounting 
after the fresh start accounting goodwill was eliminated in full  the excess of approximately million in  million in and million in was treated as an increase to capital in excess of par value and a reduction in the pre emergence deferred tax valuation allowance and pre emergence income tax liability 
we are subject to various federal and state income tax audits in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test at the end of each year 
no impairment charge was recorded in each of the last three years in connection with our annual impairment test

index to financial statements the year in review fiscal was a year in which we positioned the company for future growth while creating value for our patients and their families  our employees and our shareholders 
our most significant accomplishments in included the following we successfully operated each of our three businesses with a continued emphasis on our employees  patients  residents and their families  we completed agreements with ventas to acquire for resale under performing assets and to eliminate out of market lease provisions related to insurance requirements and facility bed management restrictions  we completed the spin off transaction  creating value for our shareholders on a tax free basis and allowing us to better focus on growth in our retained businesses  we acquired million of our common stock in open market purchases  we amended our revolving credit facility to provide more financial flexibility and better pricing  and we continued our development activities by adding four hospitals  nine nursing centers and a rehabilitation services company to our portfolio 
our hospital division continued to operate under a difficult reimbursement environment in which we were challenged by significant medicare cuts 
in response to these reimbursement reductions  our strategy has focused upon volume growth through managed care including medicare advantage and commercial insurance sources to better leverage our unused capacity 
despite overall same store volume growth of in  hospital operating income declined primarily due to reimbursement rate pressures and growth in wage rates 
in our health services division  fiscal was a year in which our continued investments in quality and customer service began to produce improvements in our operating results 
these investments over the past several years have included  among other things  improved staffing and clinical resource development  reduced contract labor utilization  investments in physical plant and equipment and expansion of services to effectively care for higher acuity medicare and managed care patients 
we also have continued to execute on our risk management initiatives  which have provided a more stable environment to improve our clinical processes and resolve quality issues as they arise 
in addition  these quality investments have enhanced our capabilities to better serve higher acuity patients and residents  many of whom required extensive rehabilitation therapy services 
our operating results in this division were encouraging  with solid growth in revenues  medicare and managed care mix and operating income compared to we believe that there are additional opportunities to improve our nursing center results in the future by continuing to execute our strategy of providing cost effective care to higher acuity patients and residents 
in peoplefirst rehabilitation  we made significant progress in to grow beyond the kindred nursing center and hospital portfolio that currently comprises more than half of its revenues 
peoplefirst has developed an effective therapist recruitment and retention program and its name recognition and reputation for clinical excellence is expanding in the marketplace 
as the labor market for therapists becomes more competitive  peoplefirst is well positioned to grow through a program of external contract development and higher levels of productivity 
over the longer term  we believe that peoplefirst has opportunities to succeed and grow in a regulatory environment that is generally favorable to providing more rehabilitation therapy services in lower cost settings  particularly nursing centers 
in june  we entered into an agreement with ventas under which we purchased for resale under performing facilities for million 
in addition  the out of market lease provisions related to insurance requirements and facility bed management issues were modified to provide more operating flexibility

index to financial statements in july  we completed the spin off transaction 
at the time of the closing  our shareholders received approximately of the common stock of pharmerica on a tax free basis 
we believe that the business prospects underlying the combination of the institutional pharmacy operations of kps and amerisourcebergen  including the operational synergies and economies of scale that can be realized over the long term  will provide additional value to our shareholders 
immediately prior to the spin off transaction  kps incurred million of bank debt  the proceeds of which were distributed to us 
in connection with the spin off transaction  we realigned our corporate and divisional overhead structure to more efficiently support our three remaining businesses 
we also are leveraging our information technology infrastructure by providing information systems support to pharmerica for a five year period 
in connection with the spin off transaction  we successfully amended our revolving credit facility 
among other things  the amendment increased the amount of the credit to million  provided for further increases in the amount of the credit under certain conditions  allowed for higher levels of capital investments and restricted payments such as share repurchases and dividends and reduced borrowing costs by approximately basis points

as we continue to position the company for the future  we see more opportunities to improve the working environment for our employees and the care of our patients and residents 
we believe that the link between taking care of our employees  quality and profitability has never been clearer 
hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
during each of the past two years  revenues have grown through increases in same store volumes  expansion of services  ongoing development of new hospitals and acquisitions 
despite growth in patient volumes and services  revenues have been negatively impacted by significant reductions in medicare reimbursement and pricing pressures from commercial insurance and managed care payors 
see part i item business governmental regulation for a discussion of the reductions in hospital medicare reimbursement

other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress and certain state legislatures have enacted or may enact additional significant cost containment measures limiting our ability to recover our cost increases through increased pricing of our healthcare services 
medicare revenues in ltac hospitals and nursing centers are subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
we believe that our operating margins may continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited 
see part i item business governmental regulation for a detailed discussion of medicare and medicaid reimbursement regulations
