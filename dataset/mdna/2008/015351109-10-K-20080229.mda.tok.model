item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in thousands  except per share data in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this form k 
the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and delivery of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states  including hematologic and neurologic diseases  cancer and autoimmune disorders 
from our inception in january through early  we devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
in march  the us food and drug administration  or fda  granted approval for our lead product soliris eculizumab for the treatment of a rare  life threatening blood disorder known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh 
in june  the european commission  or ec  also approved soliris for the treatment of pnh 
through december   our product sales have been solely attributable to sales of soliris and have been generated from three sources commercial sales in the united states beginning in the second quarter of  named patient sales in certain european countries beginning in the first quarter of and commercial sales in certain european countries beginning in the fourth quarter of 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
we expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flow for additional periods due to costs associated with the commercialization of soliris in the united states and europe  pre commercialization activities and anticipated commercialization activities in other territories  development of our manufacturing plant in rhode island  including engineering and validation runs  product research and development  preclinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  commercial scale manufacturing at our third party contractor and at our own manufacturing plant when that site is approved to manufacture soliris  and other infrastructure support costs 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we expect to continue to finance future cash needs primarily through the use of available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  availability under our credit agreement and to the extent necessary  through proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans and collaborative agreements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition royalties inventories prepaid manufacturing research and development expenses stock based compensation long lived assets income taxes revenue recognition net product sales to date  our product sales have consisted solely of soliris for the treatment of pnh 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in the company s statements of operations  and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
in some cases  we also sell soliris to government agencies 
soliris is generally shipped directly from our third party warehouse to the patients health care provider  who is not typically our direct customer 
revenue is recorded on this transaction upon receipt of the product by the patients health care provider  which is typically a hospital or physician s office 
through december   we have recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs in certain european countries 
the relevant authorities in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received formal approval for commercial sales 
in europe  we have entered into transitional agreements with a distributor to distribute soliris on a named patient basis in specified european countries 
we continue to engage with appropriate authorities on the operational  reimbursement  price approval and funding processes that are separately required by each european country 
we are more complete in those 
table of contents processes in certain countries such as germany  and in earlier stages in other countries such as the united kingdom 
in european countries in which soliris is currently commercially available and will be commercially available in the future  our customers are expected to be primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies and other health care providers  with the exception of the united kingdom  in which our primary product sales will be through a distributor 
sales within europe are recorded upon receipt of product by the health care provider 
to date  actual refunds and returns have been negligible 
because of the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and lack of return rights  soliris customers generally carry limited inventory 
accordingly  we expect that sales related to soliris will be closely tied to patient demand 
we monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether reserves are required related to inventory in our sales channels 
to the extent that our actual experience differs from our estimates  we will revise these estimates resulting in an impact in the period in which the adjustment was made 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid and programs in europe  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates  including estimates of customer mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to nine months 
upon reconciliation of government reporting to our sales records  we will revise our estimates of rebates payable  which will have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment was made 
we also record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue 
these costs are typically known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
contract research revenue we record contract research revenues from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments under collaboration with third parties  and amounts received from various government grants 
we evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered item 
up front  non refundable license fees received in connection with collaboration are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the agreement or period of performance obligations 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 

table of contents royalties we record actual and estimated royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of soliris 
we estimate royalties potentially owed to third parties based on contractual arrangements with certain parties  as well as our assessment of possible royalty amounts owed to other third parties 
these estimates may be influenced by the outcome of current litigation  the results of which are uncertain see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
on a periodic basis and based on events such as changes in the status of litigation  we may reassess these estimates  resulting in adjustments to cost of sales 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
we capitalized inventory costs associated with soliris prior to regulatory approval  but subsequent to the filing of the biologics license application  or bla  when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
a significant portion of product sold during the year ended december  was previously expensed prior to submission of our bla  and therefore is not included in the cost of product revenues during this period 
in the fourth quarter of  we fully exhausted this supply of previously expensed inventory 
beginning in  our cost of sales will reflect the full manufacturing cost of the inventory 
we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may  after a period of time  no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  at which point we would adjust our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to fully realize the carrying value of the soliris inventory 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements  based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
to date  we have not recorded any material adjustments to our inventory related to excess  expired or obsolete inventory 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply may result in write downs  which would be recorded as adjustments to cost of sales 
prepaid manufacturing costs cash advances paid by us to secure future manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs 
these costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method 
the cash advances are subject to forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production 

table of contents we evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value  or nrv 
if estimated nrv were to be negative  all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense 
our calculation of nrv involves estimates of expected sales volumes and sales price of soliris 
if actual volumes and prices are substantially less than our estimates  write downs of the prepaid manufacturing balance to cost of sales may be required 
based on our sales forecasts  we expect the carrying value of the prepaid manufacturing costs to be fully realized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  preclinical  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  manufacturing development and scale up costs  contract services and other outside contractor costs  research license fees  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities  and lab supplies 
these costs are expensed when incurred 
through march   we were involved in a collaboration research agreement with p g in which we shared costs 
we recorded those costs as research and development expenses as incurred 
a portion of those costs were reimbursed by our collaborator and were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
stock based compensation we have one stock based compensation plan known as the incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual 
table of contents volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
other than the integration plan initiated with our subsidiary  alexion antibody technology  inc  we have not experienced a significant triggering event and  therefore  have not recorded any impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
to the extent we were to experience a triggering event  particularly as it relates to our largest long lived asset  the smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility  the resulting analysis may require an impairment charge to our statement of operations 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in order to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
this critical accounting assumption has been historically accurate  as we have not been able to utilize our net deferred tax assets  and we do not expect changes to this assumption until the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets becomes certain 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
the information for the years ended december  and has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere is this form k 
the information for the year ended december  has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per share data revenues during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris related to commercial sales in the united states of  and commercial and named patient sales in the european union of  because our commercial and pre approval sales programs did not begin until  there were no sales of soliris for the year ended december  as additional pnh patients request soliris and obtain reimbursement  we expect that the number of patients taking soliris will increase  resulting in an increase in product sales in the us and europe 
we also expect product sales in europe to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the operational  reimbursement  price approval and funding process in each european country 
we recorded contract research revenues of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
contract research revenues reflect the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from p g under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab and us government funded research grant revenue for our asthma program 
for the year ended december   the increase in contract research revenue  as compared to the year ended december   was due to the termination of our collaborative agreement with p g 
effective march   we and p g agreed to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab 
as the agreement has been terminated  the remaining portion of the  non refundable upfront license fee  or  was recognized as revenue during the three months ended march  due to the termination of the p g agreement  we expect that future contract research revenue will be dependent upon future awards or grants 
for the year ended december   the decrease in us government grants  as compared to the same period in the prior year  was primarily due to the conclusion of the anthrax program in cost of sales cost of sales was  for the year ended december  there were no cost of sales incurred for periods prior to december  cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris  as well as other manufacturing costs 
changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
we expect that the purchase of patents from omrf in february will have a favorable impact on our cost of sales 
product sold during the year ended december  included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our bla  and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period 
during the fourth quarter of  we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory 
beginning in  our cost of sales will increase  reflecting the full manufacturing cost of the inventory 

table of contents research and development expenses during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of  a decrease of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to  and offset  by the following decrease of  in clinical development expense due largely to decreases in spending for pexelizumab program of  the reduction or completion of eculizumab programs  including triumph  shepherd and extension clinical trials and incurrence of costs in association with filing the bla of  these decreases were offset by increases of  related to new programs in  including explore and embrace clinical trials and the pnh registry 
increase of  in product development expenses due to an increase of  related to expenditures for drug development  quality assurance  scientific communications and regulatory affairs due to the regulatory approvals in both the united states march and the european union june 
the increase was offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of  related to the capitalization of inventory costs beginning with filing of the bla in september prior to september  we expensed all manufacturing costs  resulting in lower expenses compared to decrease of  in discovery research was primarily due to the closure of aat operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in as a result of further clinical trials and research related to eculizumab development programs in asthma  myasthenia gravis and multifocal motor neuropathy  as well as the expected initiation of a clinical study of anti cd antibody in chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
for additional information on these programs  please refer to product and development programs in item i of this form k 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial operations teams 
other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive  finance  information technology  human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity 
increase in non labor commercial operations of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   this increase was comprised primarily of increases in advertising and promotion of soliris related to the april commercial launch in the united states and market research related to approval of soliris in the european union  as well as promotion of soliris for commercial launches in certain european countries 
increase in non labor general and administration and information technology of  for the year ended december  related to increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity 

table of contents we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase at a reduced rate in  reflecting the completion of our product launch of soliris in the united states and increased promotion  marketing and other infrastructure costs outside the united states 
other income expense during the year ended december   we recognized  of foreign currency gain 
there was no foreign currency gain loss recorded in as a result of our european operations  we have exposure  primarily from accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily related to the euro 
during the year ended december   investment income and interest expense were consistent with the results recognized during the year ended december  income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the tax benefit was attributable to an increase in the estimated cash exchange of a state incremental research and development tax credit 
we expect a reduced tax benefit in due to a reduction in state research and development credits and the incurrence of state tax liabilities 
we will continue to monitor our deferred tax assets through to determine whether necessary adjustments may be required related to our valuation allowance 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  amounts in thousands  except per share data revenues we earned contract research revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue reflects the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from p g under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab  us government funded research grant revenue related to our research programs  and a nonrefundable fee for exclusive access to our xenotransplantation technologies  a program that was terminated in october research and development expenses during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of  a decrease of  or  versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to and offset by the following a significant decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses costs   and  respectively  related to the termination of the pexelizumab programs 
substantial increases in payroll and benefits costs of  which were primarily impacted by the adoption of sfas r and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants 
table of contents increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities  and research and discovery expenses increased by approximately  primarily related to development activities related to our pnh programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following increased pre commercial activities associated with soliris in the us as well as in europe  increased headcount in support of our operations  and increased expenses related to the closure of alexion antibody technologies  inc other income expenses during the year ended december   we recognized  of investment income  representing an increase  or  versus the  recognized during the year ended december  the increase was a reflection of higher market interest rates and higher cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease resulted from the lower coupon rate on the  principal amount of convertible senior notes  following the redemption of our  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  in march a state tax benefit of and  was recognized for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from our estimated exchange of our december  and incremental research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands  except per share data as of december   our consolidated cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash totaled  a decrease of  from  at december  the reduction in cash held was primarily due to our ongoing expenditures for commercialization efforts related to soliris in the united states and the european union  expenditures on our rhode island manufacturing facility  inventory purchases  and our continuing product research and development efforts 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial  corporate and us government notes in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   of cash was restricted to be used for the construction and other costs related to our rhode island manufacturing facility 
at december   our working capital was  compared to  at december  
table of contents we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
we do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing  development  or sale of soliris or any of our other drug candidates 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect to incur operating losses and negative cash flows for additional future periods due to costs associated with the launch and commercialization of soliris in the united states  pre commercialization activities and anticipated commercialization activities outside of the united states  development of our manufacturing plant in rhode island  including engineering and validation runs  product research and development  preclinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  commercial scale manufacturing at our third party contractor and at our own manufacturing plant when that site is qualified to manufacture soliris  and other infrastructure support costs 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we expect to continue to finance future cash needs primarily through cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  availability under our credit agreement  and to the extent necessary  through proceeds from equity or debt financings  loans and collaborative agreements 
the requirement to obtain additional cash from debt or equity financing will be highly dependent on our sales  and related cash collections  of soliris in the united states and european union 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  versus  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in cash used compared to the same period in the previous year is primarily due to increased commercialization activities as compared to the same period in the components of cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  are as follows net loss of  net of non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of  stock based compensation of  and the recognition of the remaining  of deferred revenue related to the termination of p g agreement net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets of  primarily attributable to increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
due to the payment terms granted to our us and european union customers  a significant portion of our product sales to date have not yet been collected 
these increases were offset by an increase in our accrued expenses for compensation and actual and estimated royalties 
in  changes in cash from operations will be highly dependent on sales levels  and related cash collections  from sales of soliris 
in addition  we expect that cash outflows related to the changes in operating assets will continue to increase related to sales and resulting accounts receivable increases and for purchases of additional inventory from our supply agreement with lonza 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  versus  provided by investing activities for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following  cash inflow from the net sale of marketable securities  which was used to fund our operations 
table of contents  of additions to property  plant and equipment  of which  was attributable to the construction of our rhode island manufacturing facility  with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs  of restricted cash used for costs incurred in connection with the construction and certain operating escrow balances of our rhode island manufacturing facility pursuant to the terms of our mortgage loan 
in july  we acquired a manufacturing plant in smithfield  rhode island for the future commercial production of soliris  for manufacturing development and for manufacturing of future products 
since this date  we have incurred costs related to the construction of the plant to support full scale commercial manufacturing 
we have also capitalized costs related to validation activities  including engineering runs  necessary to obtain approval of the facility from government regulators for the production of a commercially approved drug 
to date  these costs primarily include direct labor  materials and overhead related to the facility 
we will begin depreciating the fixed assets related to the facility when the assets are substantially complete and ready for their intended use 
through december   we have capitalized  related to the facility  which includes all costs associated with construction  renovation and upgrades  engineering runs and capitalized interest 
through december   costs incurred in seeking regulatory approval  including engineering runs  was  and capitalized interest was  cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options of  and  respectively and proceeds from the mortgage loan agreement with istar of  and  respectively 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations include our  convertible senior notes due february  or notes  our  mortgage loan due august with a fixed annual interest rate of  our annual payments of approximately  for operating and capital leases  principally for facilities and equipment  and an open letter of credit of which serves as a security deposit on our facility in cheshire  connecticut 
we also have contractual obligations related to our third party manufacturer and to other third parties 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expecting to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include milestones and assume non termination of agreements 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible notes payable mortgage loan interest expense capital and operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical and manufacturing development licenses total commercial commitments in addition to the above  we acquired from omrf in february certain patents related to complement inhibition technology from oklahoma medical research foundation  or omrf 
we will pay  plus interest  to omrf for the rights to the patents  of which  will be remitted in and the remaining  in the first half of no further amounts  including royalties  will be owed to omrf in respect of sales of soliris or other use of the omrf patents 
convertible notes payable we hold  principal amount of convertible senior notes due february   or the notes 
we pay interest on these notes on a semi annual basis on february and august of each year  beginning august  however  no principal payments are due until february  except under certain circumstances such as liquidation  merger or business combination 
the convertible notes payable do not have covenants related to our financial performance 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share per principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment  at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date of the notes 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 
as of december   the market value of our  convertible notes due february   based on quoted market prices  was estimated at  the  increase from december  is largely attributable to the increase in the price of our common stock during the period 

table of contents mortgage loan in july  we entered into a mortgage loan agreement to borrow  to finance the purchase and construction of our smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility 
in july  we amended our existing mortgage loan agreement with istar financial inc to increase the loan amount by  resulting in an aggregate principal balance of  from the effective date of the amendment  the mortgage loan bears interest at a new fixed annual rate of 
the loan principal is required to be repaid in equal monthly instalments of  starting march and until august  at which time all outstanding balances are due 
the loan is collateralized by the assets of our smithfield  ri manufacturing facility 
the loan may not be prepaid in whole or in part prior to july after that date the loan can be prepaid in whole  but not in part  and must include a prepayment premium as described in the loan agreement 
as a condition of the loan  we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts 
these accounts must be used specifically for the purchase and construction of the manufacturing facility and maintain certain operating escrow balances 
the lender has a first priority security interest and the right to approve all disbursements from the accounts holding restricted cash 
under the agreement  we are required to maintain a balance in the restricted cash accounts sufficient to complete the project 
during  a substantial portion of these disbursements were made  resulting in a restricted cash balance of the mortgage loan does not require covenants related to our financial performance 
working capital loan in february  we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na to provide for an available  revolving credit facility  that can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of alexion pharmaceuticals  inc s assets  including the pledge of the equity interests of certain direct subsidiaries  but excluding intellectual property  assets of foreign subsidiaries and assets related to our manufacturing facility in smithfield  ri 
the borrowing base is limited to of eligible domestic receivables  as defined 
as of february   we have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
we may elect that the loans under the agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to i libor plus to depending on alexion s liquidity as calculated in accordance with the agreement  or ii a base rate equal to the higher of the a prime rate then in effect and b the federal funds rate then in effect plus  plus to depending on alexion s liquidity  as defined 
interest is payable quarterly for base rate loans and  in the case of libor based loans  at the end of the applicable interest period  with the principal due on february   the maturity date 
the revolving credit facility requires that alexion comply with quarterly financial covenants related to liquidity and profitability ratios  as well as revenue 
further  the agreement includes negative covenants  subject to exceptions  restricting or limiting alexion s ability and the ability of alexion s subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  engage in certain investment  acquisition and disposition transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the agreement also contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative covenants and events of default  including payment defaults  breach of representations and warranties  covenant defaults and cross defaults 
if an event of default occurs  the interest rate would increase and the administrative agent would be entitled to take various actions  including the acceleration of amounts due under the loan 

table of contents capital leases we currently lease office equipment under capital lease agreements expiring in the assets and liabilities under capital lease agreements are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset 
the assets are amortized over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated useful lives 
the average interest rates on the above capital leases is and is imputed based on the lower of our incremental borrowing rate at the inception of each lease

commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza sales ag 
lonza agreement we have a supply agreement with lonza sales ag relating to the manufacture of soliris  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured

as a result  the net operating losses and tax credits are expected to significantly reduce cash payable for federal income taxes in the united states for the foreseeable future
