these services include armored car transportation  automated teller machine atm replenishment and servicing  currency deposit processing and cash management services including cash logistics services cash logistics  deploying and servicing safes and safe control devices  including its patented compusafe service  coin sorting and wrapping  integrated check and cash processing services virtual vault services  arranging the secure transportation of valuables global services  transporting  storing and destroying sensitive information secure data solutions and guarding services  including airport security 
brink s home security  inc bhs bhs offers monitored security services in north america for owner occupied  single family residences and  to a lesser extent  commercial properties 
bhs typically installs and owns the on site security systems and charges fees to monitor and service the systems 
management s approach to each of its security businesses is similar  with a focus on quality service  the brand  risk management and a patient and disciplined approach to markets 
management believes each business is a premium provider of services in the markets that it serves 
the company s marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by its brands so the company seeks to protect their value 
since the company s services focus on handling  transporting  protecting  and managing valuables  its employees strive to understand and manage risk 
overlaying management s approach is an understanding that the company must be disciplined and patient enough to charge fair prices that reflect the value provided  the risk assumed and the need for an adequate return for the company s investors 
the business environments in which the company s security businesses operate around the world are constantly changing 
management must continually adapt to changes in the competitive landscapes  economies in different parts of the world and even each customer s level of business 
to be successful  management must be able to balance requirements of local laws and regulations  risk  and the effects of changing demand on the utilization of its resources 
as a result  the company operates largely on a decentralized basis so local management can adjust operations to its unique circumstances 
for the same reasons that the company operates on a decentralized basis  short term forecasts of performance are difficult to make with precision 
as a result  the company does not provide detailed earnings forecasts 
the company measures financial performance on a long term basis 
the key financial factors on which it focuses are creation of value through solid returns on capital growth in revenues and earnings generation of cash flow these and similar measures are critical components of the company s incentive compensation programs and performance evaluations 
on january   the company sold bax global inc bax global  a wholly owned freight transportation subsidiary  for approximately billion in cash and recorded a pretax gain of approximately million 
on august   the company sold brink s united kingdom domestic cash handling operations 
both of these operations have been reported within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see discontinued operations for a description of the transactions and see liquidity and capital resources for a description of how the company used the proceeds 
the company has significant liabilities associated with its former coal operations 
since these liabilities generate ongoing expenses and require significant cash outflows  the company considers liability management and funding to be an important activity 
information about the company s liabilities related to its former businesses is contained in a number of sections of this report  including retained liabilities and assets of former operations application of critical accounting policies disclosures in the first section show five year projections for estimated ongoing payments and expense associated with the retained obligations of the former operations 
the second section discusses critical estimates used and provides a sensitivity analysis for these estimates

the average number of subscribers increased both in over and in over growth in operating profit in over was weaker than in over primarily as a result of selling and advertising expenses increasing more rapidly than revenues 
in addition  higher legal settlement expenses were offset by insurance gains related to hurricane katrina 
former operations expenses related to former operations in were million lower than due to lower pension and postretirement medical expenses

the company s operating profit increased by in versus due to improved performance and lower restructuring charges at brink s and continued subscriber growth at bhs 
these increases were partially offset by higher corporate expenses due to million of share based compensation costs recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas r on january  the company froze the us defined benefit pension plans effective december   and enhanced benefits for its us defined contribution k plan effective january  as a result  net expenses were lower in as follows brink s approximately million bhs approximately million corporate approximately million brink s  incorporated executive overview brink s provides services related to cash and other valuables to the financial community  retailers and other businesses 
these services include securely transporting and handling valuable assets  managing and processing currency and deposits and preparing and transmitting financial information 
the company believes that brink s has significant competitive advantages including brand name recognition reputation for high quality service proprietary cash processing and information systems high quality insurance coverage and general financial strength risk management capabilities the ability to serve a customer in multiple markets through a global network because of brink s emphasis on managing the risks inherent in handling cash and valuables and the high level of service provided  brink s believes it spends more than its competitors on training and retaining people and on the facilities and processes needed to provide quality services to customers 
as a result of management s emphasis on high quality services and risk management  brink s focuses its marketing and selling efforts on customers who appreciate the value and breadth of the services delivered and the information capabilities  risk management and financial strength underlying the brink s approach to business 
in order to earn an adequate return on capital employed in the business  brink s focuses on the effective and efficient use of its resources and the adequacy of pricing 
first  brink s attempts to maximize the amount of business which flows through its branches  vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety  security or service 
second  due to its higher costs of people and processes  brink s generally charges higher prices than competitors that may not provide the same level of service and risk management 
the company believes that brink s operations are capable of generating operating profit margins at or above in the company has established a goal to boost operating margins to by the end of the industries to which brink s provides services have been consolidating 
as a result  the strength of customers in these industries has been increasing 
customers are seeking suppliers  such as brink s  with broad geographic solutions  sophisticated outsourcing capabilities and financial strength 
operationally  brink s performance may vary from period to period 
since revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported  revenues can be affected by both the level of activity in economies and the volume of business for specific customers 
as contracts generally run for one or more years  there are costs which must be incurred to prepare to service a new customer or to transition away from one 
brink s also periodically incurs costs to reduce operations when volumes decline  including costs to reduce the number of employees and close or consolidate branch and administrative facilities 
in addition  safety and security costs can vary from period to period depending on company and industry performance and cost of insurance coverage 
cash logistics is a fully integrated solution that proactively manages the supply chain of cash from point of sale through deposit at a bank 
the process includes cashier balancing and reporting  deposit processing and consolidation  and electronic information exchange 
retail customers use brink s cash logistics services to count and reconcile coins and currency in a brink s secure environment  to prepare bank deposit information and to replenish retail locations coins and currency in proper denominations 
because cash logistics involves a higher level of service and more complex activities  customers are willing to pay prices which result in higher margins 
the ability to offer cash logistics to customers also differentiates brink s from many of its competitors 
as a result  management is committed and focused on continuing to grow cash logistics revenue 
revenues from cash logistics  including coin and note processing  were million for  million for and million for brink s revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter  because of the generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season 
as a result  margins are typically lower in the first half than in the second half of the year

overview revenues at brink s were higher in compared to primarily as a result of a combination of the effects of organic revenue growth  as defined later  and favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
operating profit in was higher than largely as a result of strong performance in latin america  particularly in venezuela  brazil and colombia  improved performance in europe and lower safety and security costs 
supplemental revenue analysis the following table and the similar table for included in the overview provide supplemental information related to organic revenue growth which is not required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company defines organic revenue growth as the change in revenue from the prior year due to factors such as changes in prices for products and services including the effect of fuel surcharges  changes in business volumes and changes in product mix 
estimates of changes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects of new acquisitions are excluded from organic revenue growth 
the supplemental organic revenue growth information presented is non gaap financial information that management uses to evaluate results of existing operations without the effects of acquisitions  dispositions and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that this information may help investors evaluate the performance of the company s operations 
the limitation of this measure is that the effects of acquisitions  dispositions and changes in values of foreign currencies cannot be completely separated from changes in prices including prices increased due to inflation and volume of the base business 
this supplemental non gaap information does not affect net income or any other reported amounts 
this supplemental non gaap information should be viewed in conjunction with the company s consolidated statements of operations 
revenue growth rates for operations outside the us include the effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
on occasion in this report  the change in revenue versus the prior year has been disclosed using constant currency exchange rates in order to provide information about growth rates without the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
growth at constant currency exchange rates equates to growth as measured in local currency 
this measurement of growth using constant currency exchange rates is higher than growth computed using actual currency exchange rates when the us dollar is strengthening and lower when the us dollar is weakening 
changes in currency exchange rates increased segment operating profit by million for compared to  and the impact for compared to was not significant

operating profit in included million of other operating income in the us for final settlement of business interruption claims related to hurricane katrina 
international revenues increased in over in all regions except for asia pacific 
increased revenues in emea and latin america were primarily the result of organic revenue growth and favorable changes in currency exchange rates

the company is highly focused on improving pricing and performance in emea and expects to continue to see operating margin improvements in if operating margins do not improve in the near term  the company may decide to take actions to improve long term performance 
restructuring charges may result from these decisions and could lower margins in latin america 
revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of on a constant currency basis 
this increase was due primarily to price increases in economies with relatively higher levels of inflation and higher volumes 
increases in volume were a reflection of the overall improvement in latin american economies 
operating profit in was higher than in due to the above mentioned price and volume increases  and cost reduction and productivity improvements across the region 
venezuela changed its national currency from the bolivar to the bolivar fuerte on january   and brink s performed additional cash handling services in late to assist in the conversion 
brink s expects increased revenue in venezuela during the first quarter of related to these services 
due to the temporary increase in volume associated with the conversion  there is an increased risk of operational issues 
the company increased resources  training and established special procedures to mitigate the risk 
asia pacific 
revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of on a constant currency basis 
this decrease was primarily due to the loss of australia s largest customer during the second quarter of  partially offset by stronger performance in hong kong  taiwan and japan

emea 
revenues increased to  million in from million in  an increase of million or on a constant currency basis largely as a result of organic revenue growth and acquisitions 
in addition  revenues were affected by competitive pressures 
brink s acquired operations in mauritius in the second quarter of poland  hungary  and the czech republic sold in january in the second quarter of luxembourg  scotland sold with the united kingdom domestic cash handling operations in and ireland in the first quarter of these acquisitions increased revenues by approximately million in over but did not have a significant impact on operating profit

revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of on a constant currency basis 
this increase was due primarily to price increases in economies with relatively higher levels of inflation and higher volumes  particularly in venezuela  brazil  colombia  argentina and chile 
the increase in volumes was a reflection of the overall improvement in latin american economies 
operating profit in was higher than due to the above mentioned volume increases  and cost reduction and productivity improvements across the region 
the increase in operating profit in the region was also bolstered by pricing improvement in brazil 
asia pacific 
revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of on a constant currency basis 
this decrease was primarily due to the loss of a major customer in australia  partially offset by stronger performance of the global service operations in hong kong and japan 
the company took actions to restructure the australian operation in and recorded charges of million 
the charges principally related to paying or accruing employee severance payments and lease obligations for closed branches 
excluding the restructuring charges  operating profit in was about the same as brink s home security executive overview bhs has reported strong growth in revenues and operating profit for several years due to its ability to attract and retain customers through brand reputation and quality service while operating as efficiently as possible consistent with the desired level of service 
in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness  bhs focuses on controlling initial marketing and installation costs by matching sales representative staffing levels with the number of sales opportunities and the size of the technician workforce with available installation volume 
bhs then strives to keep customer service and monitoring costs low without detracting from high quality service levels 
the company believes customer retention is driven by disciplined customer selection practices and high customer service levels 
in order to obtain customers who are less likely to disconnect  the company seeks to attract customers with solid credit scores and the willingness to pay reasonable up front fees 
once there is agreement to install an alarm system  the company provides a high quality installation followed by continuing high quality customer service and alarm monitoring 
bhs believes its disconnect rate benefits from consistently following this strategy 
the company believes that the performance of the us economy may affect the performance of bhs 
however  the company believes this effect is not as significant as it is for industries with close ties to national economic performance 
since more household moves take place during the second and third quarters of each year  the disconnect rate and related expenses are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth quarters

overview operating profit comprises recurring services minus the cost of the investment in new subscribers 
recurring services reflect the monthly monitoring and service earnings generated from the existing subscriber base  including the amortization of deferred revenues 
non cash impairment charges from subscriber disconnects  and depreciation and amortization expenses  including the amortization of deferred subscriber acquisition costs  are also charged to recurring services 
operating profits from recurring services are affected by the size of the subscriber base  the amount of operational costs including depreciation  the level of subscriber disconnect activity and changes in the average monthly monitoring fee per subscriber 
investment in new subscribers is the net expense primarily marketing and selling expenses incurred to add to the subscriber base every year 
the amount of the investment in new subscribers charged to income may be influenced by several factors  including the growth rate of new subscriber installations and the level of costs incurred to attract new subscribers 
as a result  increases in the rate of investment the addition of new subscribers may have a negative effect on current operating profit but a positive impact on long term operating profit  cash flow and economic value 
capital expenditures are primarily for the equipment  labor and overhead costs associated with system installations for new subscribers 
subscriber activity years ended december  change subscriber data in thousands number of subscribers beginning of period installations a disconnects a end of period b average number of subscribers disconnect rate c a customers who move from one location and then initiate a new monitoring agreement at a new location are not included in either installations or disconnects 
dealer accounts cancelled and charged back to the dealer during the specified contract term are also excluded from installations and disconnects 
inactive sites that are returned to service reduce disconnects 
disconnects include  disconnects as a result of hurricane katrina 
b the total number of subscribers at december   includes approximately  commercial customers 
the company considers expansion of bhs commercial customer base a significant growth opportunity 
c the disconnect rate is a ratio  the numerator of which is the number of customer cancellations during the period and the denominator of which is the average number of customers during the period 
the gross number of customer cancellations is reduced for customers who move from one location and then initiate a new monitoring agreement at a new location  accounts charged back to the dealers because the customers cancelled service during the specified contractual term  and inactive sites that are returned to active service during the period 
installation growth slowed to in  as compared to in and double digit growth in prior years 
installation growth is primarily the result of increased traditional branch installation volume as well as increased installations through the growing dealer network 
installation growth was hampered in and due to sluggish real estate activity in the us despite slower installation growth rates in and as compared to historical levels  the average number of subscribers increased during the year 
this is because the number of installations  in continued to substantially exceed the number of disconnects  in 
the annualized disconnect rate for increased to compared to in the increase in the disconnect rate in over primarily resulted from expiring multi family housing agreements of the disconnect rate and technical adjustments during quarterly reconciliations approximately of the disconnect rate 
in the annualized disconnect rate was excluding the effects of hurricane katrina 
bhs has maintained a low disconnect rate in recent years by improving subscriber selection and retention processes 
household moves are a major driver of disconnects 
the disconnect rate may not materially improve in the future since some disconnects are beyond the company s control  including customers moving and canceling service 
bhs has observed a slowing in the rate of household moves in many regions of the country throughout most of and household moves  a primary cause of disconnects  are also a significant contributor to installation volume 
moreover  further instability in the housing and credit markets could affect bhs ability to collect receivables from customers 
in  assuming little or no recovery in housing  bhs believes revenue and operating profit growth should continue to be at least while subscriber growth should be in the high single digit percentage range 
bhs expects to continue to build its commercial alarm installation and monitoring business in  although difficulties are expected to continue in its bht business as a result of lower new home production in the us bhs  however  is seeking to increase market share through expanded relationships with major home builders 
as a result  the investment in new subscribers  on a per new subscriber basis  may grow faster in the future 
the increase in bhs revenues in over was primarily due to the larger subscriber base and higher average monitoring rates  partially offset by a decline in brink s home technologies bht pre wire and trim out revenues 
the larger subscriber base and higher monitoring rates also contributed to a increase in monthly recurring revenues for december as compared to december bhs intends to continue to selectively raise monitoring prices in the future 
operating profit increased million in compared to due to higher profit from recurring services  which was only partially offset by the increased cost of investment in new subscribers 
higher profit from recurring services in was primarily due to increased monitoring and service revenues and cost efficiencies generated from the larger subscriber base 
additionally  bhs recorded million of insurance settlement gains in for final settlement of property damage and business interruption insurance claims related to hurricane katrina  offset by a million increase in legal settlement expenses 
the insurance settlement gains are included in other operating income in the statement of operations  and recurring services in the bhs segment operating profit table 
higher investment in new subscribers was primarily due to increased installation volume and higher marketing expenses incurred in traditional branch operations  partially offset by lower expenses  net of revenues  in bht 
the growth of investment in new subscribers in compared to was greater than in the prior year comparison as a result of increased advertising 
as a result of the continuing slowdown in the new housing market  pre wire activity for homebuilders was down more than in compared to  and monitored activations for completed homes decreased 
the increase in bhs revenues in over was primarily due to the larger subscriber base and slightly higher average monitoring rates 
these factors also contributed to a increase in monthly recurring revenues for december compared to december operating profit increased million in compared to due to higher profit from recurring services  which was only slightly offset by the increased cost of investment in new subscribers 
higher profit from recurring services in was primarily due to incremental revenues and cost efficiencies generated from the larger subscriber base  partially offset by initial costs of starting up and integrating the operations of the new knoxville facility with those of the existing irving  texas  facility 
higher investment in new subscribers was primarily due to increased installation volume 
the growth of investment in new subscribers in compared to was less than in the prior year comparison as a result of slower installation growth 
as a result of the sharp slowdown in the new housing market in the second half of the year  pre wire activity for major homebuilders was down more than for the full year 
however  monitored activations for completed homes increased 
the construction of a second monitoring center in knoxville  tennessee  was completed and the facility began operations in the first quarter of the knoxville monitoring center provides additional service capacity for the existing subscriber base  increases capacity to sustain continued growth  and provides enhanced security and disaster recovery capabilities 
as expected  operating the new facility resulted in additional general and administrative expense during bhs s costs in related to retirement plans were million lower than in the prior year primarily as a result of the company s decision to freeze us defined benefit pension plan benefits at december  fuel costs stabilized and copper prices declined during the second half of from the elevated levels of early  although the costs of both were generally higher throughout than during much of these higher costs have not significantly affected operating profit to date primarily because a large portion of these costs are capitalized as part of the costs of installing new monitoring sites 
reconciliation of non gaap measures monthly recurring revenues the purpose of this table is to reconcile monthly recurring revenues  a non gaap measure  to revenues  its closest gaap counterpart 
years ended december  in millions monthly recurring revenues mrr a amounts excluded from mrr amortization of deferred revenue other revenues b revenues on a gaap basis december january november january december a mrr is calculated based on the number of subscribers at period end multiplied by the average fee per subscriber received in the last month of the period for contracted monitoring and maintenance services 
b revenues that are not pursuant to monthly contractual billings 
the company uses mrr to evaluate bhs performance  and believes the presentation of mrr is useful to investors because the measure is widely used in the industry to assess the amount of recurring revenues from subscriber fees that a home security business produces 
this supplemental non gaap information should be reviewed in conjunction with the company s consolidated statements of operations 
corporate expense the brink s company years ended december  change in millions corporate expense corporate expense in was higher than as a result of professional  legal and advisory fees incurred related to initiatives by certain of the company s shareholders and a proxy contest initiated by mmi investments  lp mmi  one of the company s shareholders  over board of director candidates to be elected at the annual meeting 
the company reached an agreement with mmi on february   agreeing to reimburse up to million of out of pocket expenses incurred by mmi related to the proxy contest 
in addition  the company expects corporate expense in to be higher as a result of professional fees associated with the spin off of bhs and recent shareholder initiatives 
after the spin off expected in the fourth quarter of expenses related to the spin off will be classified within discontinued operations 
corporate expense was higher in compared to due primarily to recording million in of share based compensation costs as a result of adopting a new accounting standard  partially offset by lower professional and consulting fees associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act of as the company outsourced less work during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the adoption of sfas r  share based payment 
former operations for the components of expense from former operations  see expenses in continuing operations within retained liabilities and assets of former operations 
retained liabilities and assets of former operations executive overview the company has obligations which arose as the result of its long history of operating in the coal industry 
since these obligations are complex and potentially financially volatile  management believes it is important to closely monitor and manage these obligations 
some of these obligations reclamation  advance minimum royalties and workers compensation have shorter terms and lesser values 
the company expects the cash payments for these obligations to be concentrated over the next few years and then end or decline significantly 
other obligations retiree medical benefit plan and black lung have longer terms and higher estimated costs 
payments associated with these liabilities are projected to be made over the next years or more 
these liabilities are largely medical benefits related  so medical inflation is an important consideration 
these obligations cover a pool of individuals that is essentially capped since the company no longer operates within the coal industry 
since most of the covered individuals are  for the most part  above or near normal retirement age  these obligations should see a steady decrease in the number of participants and beneficiaries over time 
the net present value of these obligations is a valuable tool for assessing their fair value as of a point in time 
however  such values will fluctuate over time solely due to changes in market interest rates 
as a result  the company believes the critical factor in evaluating each obligation is the cash flow needed to satisfy it 
the company employs a team of employees  along with third parties  to monitor and control these liabilities with a primary goal of reducing future cash outflows 
the primary activities of this group are to verify participant eligibility  design and implement plans that provide the required benefits at the lowest cost  and verify costs charged to the plans 
the company has established a veba to help manage the financial impact of the retiree medical benefit plan obligation 
the veba is used as a tax efficient way to fund this obligation 
a well funded veba should help insulate the company s assets and cash flow from this obligation 
at december   the veba held investments with a fair value of million 
the company elected to begin using the assets of the veba to fund benefit payments beginning january   and paid million of benefits from the veba in the company refers to its various long term liabilities and assets related to its former operations as its legacy liabilities and assets 
the legacy liabilities and assets in the following table are based on a variety of estimates  including actuarial assumptions  as described in the application of critical accounting policies and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimated liabilities and assets will change in the future to reflect payments made  investment returns  annual actuarial revaluations  periodic revaluations of reclamation liabilities and other changes in estimates 
actual amounts could differ materially from the estimated amounts

the company uses various assumptions to estimate its liability to the united mine workers of america umwa combined fund the combined fund for future annual premiums  including the number of beneficiaries in future periods and medical inflation 
c the company has not yet taken deductions in its tax returns for most of the net legacy liabilities associated with the former coal business  and has recorded a deferred tax asset for this future benefit for these temporary differences between book and tax bases 
under the health benefit act  the company and various current and former subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for approximately million of postretirement medical and health benefit act obligations in the above table 
the company is reviewing the alternative means to lessen the impact of joint and several liabilities as allowed by the tax relief and health care act of the act 
the purchasers of the company s bax global and natural resources assets have been indemnified by the company for the related contingent liability

the company may elect at any time to use either these assets or its cash from operations to pay benefits for its retiree medical plans 
the company began paying benefits from the veba in  and expects to continue paying benefits from the veba in and later years

the amounts paid or expensed in the future depend on many factors  including inflation in health care and other costs  the ultimate impact of the medicare reform bill  discount rates  the level of contributions to and the investment performance of the veba  whether the company s assets or veba assets are used to pay benefits  the number of participants in various benefit programs  and the level of administrative costs needed to manage the retained liabilities 
following are comments covering the more significant legacy liabilities in the above tables 
for additional information  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
each of these liabilities and assets is affected by estimates and judgments 
more information is available at application of critical accounting policies later in management s discussion and analysis 
company sponsored retiree medical benefits obligations and veba the company provides postretirement health care benefits to eligible former coal miners and their dependents 
with the assistance of actuaries  the company annually reevaluates the estimated future cash flows  expenses and current values of the obligations 
projected payments are expected to increase each year for the next five years as a result of medical inflation and as eligible participants attain retirement age 
this increase will be partially offset by reductions in the number of participants through mortality 
the net liability decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the increase in the discount rate by basis points to 
a veba has been established by the company under internal revenue code section c 
in general  a contribution made to the veba becomes deductible for federal income tax purposes in the year in which it is made 
investment earnings within the veba and distributions from the veba to pay designated benefits or to reimburse the company for designated benefit payments have no federal income tax effect on the company 
the company can determine the timing and size of any payment from the veba to cover expenses of eligible participants 
the following table summarizes the activity in the veba for the last three years balance at benefit balance at in millions january  contributions earnings payments december  the veba s assets are allocated among active investment managers of equities and fixed income securities 
as of december   approximately of the veba assets are invested in equities and are invested in fixed income securities 
the veba s assets are being invested in a similar fashion to the company s primary us pension plan and the company has estimated the same expected long term rate of return of per year 
black lung obligations the company makes payments to former miners who have been determined to have pneumoconiosis black lung disease 
such payments primarily cover disability payments and condition related medical expenses 
these payments stretch out over many years and have been discounted to a net present value 
actuarial gains and losses are deferred 
accumulated unrecognized gains and losses in excess of of the funded status are amortized into continuing expense over the average remaining life expectancy of all participants approximately years 
the black lung obligation increased to million in from million in largely due to several inactive miners filing new claims in  partially offset by the effect of increasing the discount rate by basis points to as of december  future cash payments are expected to gradually decline as the number of participants declines through mortality 
future expense levels are also expected to decline as the remaining value of the obligation declines 
primary us pension plan the company has a us defined benefit pension plan for which benefit levels were frozen effective december  as a result  participants in the plan ceased earning additional benefits at december  participants who have not met requirements for vesting are continuing to accrue vesting service in accordance with terms of the plans 
using actuarial assumptions as of december   the plan had an accumulated benefit obligation abo of approximately million 
the abo represents the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted to december  at 
the company changed its method of estimating its discount rate in as of december   the discount rate used to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations was derived using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on the citigroup pension discount curve and the mercer yield curve 
the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and a discount rate is determined for each curve  the average of the two discount rates is selected and is rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
as market interest rates fluctuate  the net present value of the company s obligation will change 
the impact of a one percentage point basis points change in the discount rate used at december   would have been as follows discount rates increased decreased in millions by by increase decrease in abo at december  expense at december   the fair value of the plan s assets was approximately million 
the company uses a long term rate of return assumption to determine expected annual income from plan assets 
this expected annual income reduces future plan expense 
the company s expected long term rate of return in is 
if the company were to use a different long term rate of return assumption  annual pension expense would be different 
the historical and projected benefit payments and expense for the us plan are set out in the table below 
the projected benefit payments and expense reflect assumptions used in the valuation at december  these assumptions are reviewed annually  and it is likely that they will change in future years 
in millions actual projected years ending december  payment of benefits paid from plan trust expense income as can be noted from the above table  freezing the plan significantly reduced pension expense in the level of expense decreased slightly in primarily as a result of higher plan assets 
the above expense amounts were charged to the business segments in approximately the following proportions brink s  bhs  corporate  former operations 
the amount of cash the company may have to contribute in the future for the company s primary us pension plan is determined using a different set of assumptions which are generally more conservative than the market based assumptions used under gaap for financial accounting purposes 
the company voluntarily contributed million to the primary us pension plan in the company currently projects million of contributions to be made to the primary us pension plan over the next five years  but this projection could change 
these estimated future contributions are higher than that projected last year as a result of the impact of the pension protection act of which increased the minimum funding requirements for plan years beginning in actual investment returns and interest rates are likely to differ from those assumed at december   this could result in a change in projected contributions 
voluntary contributions have the effect of reducing and potentially delaying later required contributions 
the pension plan s benefits will be paid out over an extended period of time 
accordingly  the company takes a long term approach to funding levels and contribution policies 
historically  long term returns on assets invested have significantly exceeded the discount rate for pension liabilities so it is expected that a portion of the future liability will be funded by investment returns 
on a gaap basis  the plan was funded at december  other operating income  net other operating income  net  is a component of the operating segments previously discussed operating profits

the company does not expect to receive significant dividends on its real estate investment in the company made a million make whole payment associated with the prepayment of the senior notes in income taxes provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate years ended december  in millions in percentages continuing operations discontinued operations overview the company s effective tax rate has varied in the past three years from the statutory us federal rate due to various factors  including changes in valuation allowances changes in the geographical mix of earnings timing of benefit recognition for uncertain tax positions state income taxes repatriation of earnings in the initial recognition of a net deferred tax benefit in recorded as a result of the decision to sell the stock of bax global the company establishes or reverses valuation allowances for deferred tax assets depending on all available information including historical and expected future operating performance of its subsidiaries 
changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances 
based on the company s historical and future expected taxable earnings  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the company currently believes its effective income tax rate in will be approximately to 
the actual tax rate could be materially different from the company s estimate 
continuing operations the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to a million net increase in the state tax expense and a million increase related to a net increase in the valuation allowance for non us deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to million of state income tax expense and a million net increase in the valuation allowance for non us deferred tax assets  primarily related to european operations 
the effective income tax rate on continuing operations in was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily as a result of new valuation allowances in various countries in south america and europe  the effects of losses in tax jurisdictions for which the company does not record a tax benefit for such losses and million of tax expense related to the repatriation of non us earnings 
this was partially offset by the favorable resolution of contingent state income tax matters 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the tax provision or benefit associated with the company s bax global and other former businesses  and the resolution of associated contingent tax matters 
the income tax benefit on the pretax loss from discontinued operations in was lower than the us statutory tax rate due to tax benefits not recognized related to losses at brink s united kingdom domestic cash handling operations 
the effective tax rate in approximated the us statutory tax rate 
the effective tax rate in was lower than the us statutory tax rate primarily as a result of an income tax benefit of million recorded upon the resolution of income tax matters with the internal revenue service related to the former natural resource business 
in addition  the company recognized a million net deferred tax benefit for the excess of the tax basis over the carrying value of the company s investment in bax global as a result of the company s decision to sell bax global s stock 
other as of december   the company has not recorded us federal deferred income taxes on the majority of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for income taxes special areas  as amended 
it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested in operations outside the us it is not practical to compute the estimated deferred tax liability on these earnings 
minority interest years ended december  change in millions minority interest the increase in minority interest in the last two years is primarily due to increases in the earnings of brink s venezuelan and colombian subsidiaries  which are not wholly owned

the company expects to recognize up to million of additional income in discontinued operations during future periods as the assumption of remaining contractual obligations by the buyer is completed 
these operations recorded a million impairment charge in  primarily related to writing down leasehold improvements and vehicles to estimated fair value due to the loss of customers 
these operations have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
bax global on january   the company sold bax global  a wholly owned freight transportation subsidiary  for approximately billion in cash  resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million million after tax 
the operating results of bax global s operations through the date of sale have been classified as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
adjustments to contingent assets and liabilities of former operations health benefit act liabilities 
the company s obligations under the health benefit act  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  was reduced by million in  primarily due to the act 
the law significantly reduced the company s future estimated payments to the combined fund 
withdrawal liabilities 
the company withdrew from the umwa and pension plans in june as the last employees working under umwa labor agreements left the company 
as a result of the withdrawal from these coal related plans  the company settled its liabilities and made final payments to the plans amounting to million in july a pretax benefit of million related to this settlement was recorded in prior to the settlement payment  the company estimated the obligation based on the funded status of the multi employer plans at the most recent measurement date 
the change in the company s liability in was due to changes in the umwa plans unfunded liabilities 
federal black lung excise tax 
in  the us district court of the eastern district of virginia entered a final judgment in favor of the company  ruling that the federal black lung excise tax fblet is unconstitutional as applied to export coal sales 
in december  the company reached a final settlement agreement related to all claims for fblet refunds and recorded a pretax gain of million 
other 
the company recorded expenses of million in and million in to reflect an increase in the estimated cost of reclamation at its former coal mines 
income of million was recorded during to reflect a decrease in estimated costs 
the estimate of the cost of reclamation may change in the future 
foreign operations the company operates in approximately countries outside the us  each with a local currency other than the us dollar 
because the financial results of the company are reported in us dollars  they are affected by changes in the value of various foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the diversity of foreign operations helps to mitigate a portion of the impact that foreign currency fluctuations in any one country may have on the translated results 
the company  from time to time  uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies  as discussed in item a below 
brink s venezuelan subsidiaries brink s venezuela were considered to be operating in a highly inflationary economy in since then  venezuela s economy has not been considered to be highly inflationary 
it is possible that venezuela s economy may be considered highly inflationary again at some time in the future 
the company is exposed to certain risks when it operates in highly inflationary economies  including the risk that the rate of price increases for services will not keep pace with cost inflation adverse economic conditions in the highly inflationary country may discourage business growth which could affect demand for the company s services the devaluation of the currency may exceed the rate of inflation and reported us dollar revenues and profits may decline brink s venezuela is also subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted 
it is possible that brink s venezuela may be subject to less favorable exchange rates on dividend remittances in the future 
the company s reported us dollar revenues  earnings and equity would be adversely affected if revenues and operating profits of brink s venezuela were to be reported using a less favorable currency exchange rate 
the company is also subject to other risks customarily associated with doing business in foreign countries  including labor and economic conditions  political instability  controls on repatriation of earnings and capital  nationalization  expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments 
the future effects  if any  of these risks on the company cannot be predicted

see note for operating leases that have residual value guarantees or other terms that cause the agreement to be considered a variable interest 
the company uses operating leases to lower its cost of financings 
the company believes operating leases are an important component of its capital structure

the expected timing of the cash settlement for the remaining million is currently not reasonably estimable 
surety bonds and letters of credit the company is required by various state and federal laws to provide security with regard to its obligations to pay workers compensation benefits  reclaim lands used for mining by the company s former coal operations and satisfy other obligations 
as of december   the company had outstanding surety bonds with third parties totaling approximately million that it has arranged in order to satisfy various security requirements 
most of these bonds provide financial security for obligations which have already been recorded as liabilities 
surety bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis  however  there can be no assurance the bonds will be renewed or that premiums in the future will not increase 
the company believes that it has adequate available borrowing capacity under its letter of credit facility and its revolving facility to provide letters of credit or other collateral to secure its obligations if the remaining surety bonds are not renewed 
the company has issued letters of credit of million under its million letter of credit facility  described in debt above 
at december   all of these issued letters of credit were being used to secure various obligations 
contingent matters income tax the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
the company has accrued approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits at december  the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits has been measured in accordance with fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin 
the amount of tax benefits ultimately recognized for open tax periods at december   will depend on the final outcome of the various issues that may arise during an examination  and the tax benefit recognized may be materially different from that amount as measured under fin former operations the company has recorded estimated liabilities for contingent obligations  including those for premiums to the combined fund  coal related workers compensation claims and reclamation obligations

bax global  a former business unit of the company  is defending a claim related to the apparent diversion by a third party of goods being transported for a customer 
although bax global is defending this claim vigorously and believes that its defenses have merit  it is possible that this claim ultimately may be decided in favor of the claimant 
if so  the company expects that the ultimate amount of reasonably possible unaccrued losses could range from to million 
the company has contractually indemnified the purchaser of bax global for this contingency 
value added taxes vat and customs duties during  the company determined that one of its non us brink s business units had not paid customs duties and vat with respect to the importation of certain goods and services 
the company was advised that civil and criminal penalties could be asserted for the non payment of these customs duties and vat 
although no penalties have been asserted to date  they could be asserted at any time 
the business unit has provided the appropriate government authorities with an accounting of unpaid customs duties and vat and has made payments covering its calculated unpaid vat 
the company believes that the range of reasonably possible losses is between million and million for potential penalties on unpaid vat and has accrued million 
the company believes that the range of possible losses for unpaid customs duties and associated penalties  none of which has been accrued  is between and million 
the company believes that the assertion of the penalties on unpaid customs duties would be excessive and would vigorously defend against any such assertion 
the company does not expect to be assessed interest charges in connection with any penalties that may be asserted 
the company continues to diligently pursue the timely resolution of this matter and  accordingly  the company s estimate of the potential losses could change materially in future periods 
the assertion of potential penalties may be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the application of accounting principles requires the use of assumptions  estimates and judgments which are the responsibility of management 
management makes estimates and judgments based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes  similarly situated businesses and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with relevant knowledge and experience 
many assumptions  estimates and judgments are straightforward  others are not 
reported results could have been materially different had management used a different set of assumptions  estimates and judgments 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance it is common for companies to record expenses and accruals before the related payments are actually made 
in the us  and most other countries and tax jurisdictions  many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are paid 
similarly  some tax credits and tax loss carry forwards cannot be used until future periods when sufficient taxable income is generated 
in these circumstances  under gaap  companies accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that the company will receive the tax benefits 
these benefits deferred tax assets are often offset  in whole or in part  by the effects of deferred tax liabilities which relate primarily to deductions available for tax return purposes under existing tax laws and regulations before such costs are reported as expenses under gaap 
as of december   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
a significant amount of the company s deferred tax assets relates to expected future tax deductions arising from retiree medical and other coal related expenses the company has already recorded in its financial statements 
for more details associated with this net balance  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
since there is no absolute assurance that these assets will be ultimately realized  management reviews the company s deferred tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
periodic reviews include  among other things  the nature and amount of the taxable income and expense items  the expected timing when assets will be used or liabilities will be required to be reported and the reliability of historical profitability of businesses expected to provide future earnings 
furthermore  management considers tax planning strategies it can use to increase the likelihood that the tax assets will be realized 
if after conducting the periodic review  management determines that the realization of the tax asset does not meet the more likely than not criteria  an offsetting valuation allowance is recorded thereby reducing net earnings and the deferred tax asset in that period 
for these reasons and since changes in estimates can materially affect net earnings  management believes the accounting estimate related to deferred tax asset valuation allowances is a critical accounting estimate 
due to its expectation that the historical profitability of the company s us portion of the brink s and bhs operations will continue and the lengthy period over which coal related liabilities will become available for deduction on tax returns  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that these us federal net deferred tax assets will be realized 
for us state jurisdictions and us jurisdictions  the company has evaluated its ability to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets on an individual jurisdiction basis 
due to a recent history of losses in some non us jurisdictions and doubts about whether future operating performance will be sufficiently profitable to realize deferred tax assets  the company has approximately million of valuation allowances at december  among other things  should tax statutes  the timing of deductibility of expenses or expectations for future performance change  the company could decide to adjust its valuation allowances  which would increase or decrease tax expense  possibly materially 
goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment valuations accounting policies at december   the company had property and equipment of  million  goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the company reviews these assets for possible impairment using the guidance in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  for goodwill and sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  for other intangible assets and property and equipment 
the review for impairment requires the use of significant judgments about the future performance of the company s operating subsidiaries and  as such  the company believes they represent critical accounting estimates 
application of accounting policies goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the company estimates the fair value of brink s  the only reporting unit that has goodwill  primarily using estimates of future cash flows 
the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated 
to date  no impairment has been identified 
due to a history of profitability and cash flow generation  the carrying value of goodwill of brink s is believed to be appropriate 
other intangible assets and property and equipment to determine if an impairment exists related to long lived assets besides goodwill  the company compares estimates of the future undiscounted net cash flows of groups of assets to their carrying value when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for purposes of assessing impairment  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
prior to selling a portion of its united kingdom operation  brink s recognized in a million impairment charge 
besides this  brink s has had no other significant impairments of property and equipment in the last three years 
each quarter  when bhs customers disconnect their monitoring service  bhs records an impairment charge based on the carrying value of the related security systems determined to be permanently disconnected which takes into account future expected reconnections 
future expected reconnections are estimated using historical data 
should the estimate of future reconnection experience change  bhs s impairment charges would be affected 
employee and retiree benefit obligations the company provides its employees and retirees benefits through company sponsored plans  including defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical benefit plans and under statutory requirements eg  black lung and workers compensation obligations 
the primary benefits which require the company to make cash payments over an extended period of years are pension obligation retiree medical obligation black lung obligation workers compensation obligation accounting policy the company accounts for its pension plans under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended 
the company accounts for its retiree medical obligations and black lung obligations under sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as amended 
following annual remeasurements  the company records changes in liabilities and associated expenses as required under these accounting standards 
as is normal for these benefits  cash payments will be made for periods ranging from the current year to over seventy years from now for some of these benefits 
the amount of the cash payments and related expenses will be affected over time by inflation  salary increases  investment returns and market interest rates  changes in the numbers of plan participants and changes in the benefit obligations and or laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of these items and because the obligations are significant  the company believes these represent critical accounting estimates 
the critical accounting estimates that determine the carrying values of liabilities and the resulting annual expense are discussed below 
the plans that are affected by the assumptions discussed are identified parenthetically in the relevant title 
application of accounting policy discount rate pension  retiree medical and black lung a discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the rate should reflect returns expected from high quality bonds and will fluctuate over time with market interest rates 
in general  the company s liability changes in an inverse relationship to interest rates  ie the lower the discount rate  the higher the associated plan obligation 
the company changed its method of estimating its discount rate in as of december   the discount rate used to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations was derived using the cash flow matching method 
under this method  the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yields on the citigroup pension discount curve and the mercer yield curve 
the cash flows are then discounted to their present value and a discount rate is determined for each curve  the average of the two discount rates is selected and is rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point 
as of december   the company selected a discount rate of for the us pension plans and retiree medical plans  and a discount rate of for the black lung obligations 
prior to  the company selected a discount rate for its plan obligations after reviewing published long term yield information for a small number of high quality fixed income securities eg moody s aa bond yields 
the company s advisors also calculated yields for the broader range of long term high quality securities with maturities in line with expected payments 
after considering these factors  the company selected a discount rate of as of december  sensitivity analysis the discount rate selected at year end affects the valuations of plan obligations at year end and calculations of net periodic expenses for the following year 
the tables below compare hypothetical plan obligation valuations as of december   and estimated expenses for if the company had used discount rates that were basis points lower or higher 
plan obligations at december  hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions primary us pension plan accumulated benefit obligation coal related retiree medical accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions black lung apbo projected expense benefit hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions primary us pension plan coal related retiree medical hypothetical actual hypothetical in millions black lung return on assets pension and retiree medical the company s primary us defined benefit pension plan had assets at december   valued at approximately million 
this pension plan s assets are invested primarily using actively managed accounts with asset allocation targets of domestic equities and international equities  both of which include a broad array of market capitalization sizes and investment styles  and fixed income securities 
the company s policy does not permit certain investments  including investments in the brink s company common stock  unless part of a commingled fund 
fixed income investments must have an investment grade rating at the time of purchase 
assets are rebalanced on a quarterly basis if actual allocations of assets are outside predetermined ranges 
among other factors  the performance of asset groups and investment managers will affect the long term rate of return 
the company sponsored retiree medical plan had assets in a veba at december   valued at approximately million 
the assets in the veba are invested and managed on a similar basis to the pension plan 
accordingly  the same long term rate of return assumption is used for the veba 
pension accounting principles require companies to use estimates of expected asset returns over long periods of time 
the company selects the expected long term rate of return assumption using advice from its investment advisor and its actuary considering the plan s asset allocation targets and expected overall investment manager performance and a review of its most recent ten year and twenty year historical average compounded rate of return 
after following the above process  the company selected as its expected long term rate of return as of december  and it is unlikely that in any given year the actual rate of return will be the same as the assumed long term rate of return 
in general  if actual returns exceed the expected long term rate of return  future levels of expense will go down and vice versa 
over the last ten years  the annual returns of the company s primary pension plan have fluctuated from a high of a gain to a low of a loss and averaged  on a compounded basis   net of fees  per annum over the period 
during that time period  there were six years in which returns exceeded the assumed long term rate of return and four years  the three years ended december  and the year ended december   with returns below the assumed long term rate of return 
if the company were to use a different long term rate of return assumption  it would affect annual pension expense but would have no immediate effect on funding requirements 
for every hypothetical change of basis points in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets  the company s us annual pension plan expense in would have increased or decreased by approximately million before tax 
similarly  the benefit of investment income in the veba would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
the reduction or credit to pension expense associated with the assumed investment return fluctuates based on the level of plan assets over time  the higher the level of assets  the higher the credit and vice versa and the assumed rate of return the higher the rate  the higher the credit and vice versa 
for the pension plan  the company calculates expected investment returns by applying the expected long term rate of return to the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of the plan assets is different from the actual or fair market value of the assets 
the actual or fair market value is the value of the assets at a point in time that is available to make payments to pensioners and to cover any transaction costs 
the market related value recognizes changes in fair value on a straight line basis over five years 
this recognition method spreads the effects of year over year volatility in the financial markets over several years 
the company has elected to calculate expected investment returns on assets in the veba by applying the expected long term rate of return to the fair market value of the assets at year end 
this method is likely to cause the credit to earnings from the veba s expected return to fluctuate more than the similar credit in the pension plan 
salary inflation pension historically  pension expense and liabilities varied with the expected rate of salary increases the higher or lower the annual increase  the higher or lower the liability and expense 
since the company has frozen benefits under the us defined benefit pension plan  this assumption will no longer affect future pension expense and liability for that plan 
medical inflation retiree medical changes in medical inflation will affect liability and expense amounts differently for the company s plans 
there is a direct link between medical inflation and expected spending for postretirement medical benefits under the company sponsored plan for and for later years 
for the company sponsored retiree medical plan  the company assumed an inflation rate of for  and projects this rate to decline to by the average annual increase for medical inflation in the plan for the last five years has been below 
because of the volatility of medical inflation it is likely that there will be future adjustments to these estimates  although the direction and extent of these adjustments cannot be predicted at the present time 
if the company had assumed that the health care cost trend rates would be basis points higher in each future year  the apbo for the coal related retiree medical benefit plan would have been approximately million higher at december   and the expense for would have been million higher 
if the company had assumed that the future health care cost trend rate would be basis points lower  the apbo would have been approximately million lower at december   and the related expenses would have been million lower 
workers compensation besides the effects of changes in medical costs  worker s compensation costs are affected by the severity and types of injuries  changes in state and federal regulations and their application and the quality of programs which assist an employee s return to work 
the company s liability for future payments for workers compensation claims is evaluated annually with the assistance of its actuary 
numbers of participants all plans the valuations of all of these benefit plans are affected by the life expectancy of the participants 
accordingly  the company relies on actuarial information to predict the number and life expectancy of participants 
the company uses the following mortality table for its major plans 
plan mortality table retiree medical rp employee  annuitant and combined healthy blue collar black lung group annuity mortality primary us pension rp combined healthy blue collar the number of participants by major plan is as follows plan number of participants coal related all other total retiree medical black lung primary us pension since the company is no longer operating in the coal industry  it anticipates that the number of participants in the coal related postretirement medical plan and the number of participants receiving benefits under black lung regulations will decline over time due to mortality 
since the us pension plan has been frozen  the number of its participants should also decline over time 
changes in laws all plans the company s valuations of its liabilities are determined under existing laws and regulations 
changes in laws and regulations which affect the ultimate level of liabilities and expense are reflected once the changes are final and their impact can be reasonably estimated 
recent changes in laws that provide government subsidies for amounts paid for pharmaceuticals for medicare eligible medical plan participants have reduced the company s liability 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted standards the company adopted fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas  effective january  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the adoption of this interpretation increased retained earnings at january   by million 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas r  share based payment  effective january  prior to adopting sfas r  the company accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the predecessor to sfas r 
under the intrinsic value method no share based compensation cost was recognized as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the fair value of those awards 
in addition  sfas r requires additional accounting and disclosures for the income tax and cash flow effects of share based payment arrangements 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  the company began recognizing share based compensation costs on january   but did not restate prior periods 
the amount of compensation cost recognized was computed based on the requirements of sfas r for share based awards granted  modified or settled in  and based on the requirements of sfas for the unvested portion of awards granted prior to under sfas r  cash flows from the benefit of tax deductions for stock options in excess of compensation cost are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
under sfas  these cash flows were included in operating activities and the prior year amounts have not been reclassified 
in addition  under sfas r  the company no longer separately reports the brink s company employee benefits trust the employee benefits trust in its consolidated statement of shareholders equity and consolidated balance sheet  it is now offset with capital in excess of par value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information and for the required pro forma disclosures under sfas for periods prior to the company adopted sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  effective december  prior to the adoption of sfas  the company accounted for its pension plans under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as previously amended  and for its company sponsored retiree medical plans and black lung obligations under sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as previously amended 
sfas requires companies to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multi employer plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in funded status through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
the adoption of sfas reduced the amount of consolidated equity reported by the company as of december   by million 
in addition  sfas requires current liability classification when the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months exceeds the fair value of plan assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  effective december   which is codified as sab topic n  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach dual method approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
prior to the adoption of sab  the company evaluated errors using only the income statement approach 
the company had previously identified that it had been incorrectly applying its accounting policy for recording impairment charges upon subscriber disconnects at bhs 
prior to the adoption of sab  the company determined this incorrect application was not material to the financial statements using the income statement approach 
the correction of this application was considered material using the dual method approach due to the impact on the trend of segment operating profit of bhs 
upon adoption of sab  to correctly apply its accounting policy to subscriber disconnects  the company recorded a million million after tax increase to retained earnings in in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas  asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas includes a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset in which the timing and or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated  even if conditional on a future event 
the company has conditional asset retirement obligations primarily associated with leased facilities 
the company adopted fin on december   and recognized the following in millions adjustment at december  increase in assets leasehold improvements noncurrent deferred income tax asset increase in liabilities asset retirement obligations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax a a includes million of cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  related to bax global and million related to brink s united kingdom domestic cash handling operations 
standards not yet adopted in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosure of fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of  however  in february  the fasb issued fsp  partial deferral of the effective date of sfas  which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the company does not expect that the implementation of sfas  as it relates to the company s financial assets and financial liabilities  will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  as it relates to the company s nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
unrealized gains and losses  arising subsequent to the election of the fair value option  are reported in earnings 
the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of the company does not expect that the implementation sfas will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r establishes requirements for an acquirer to record the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any related noncontrolling interest related to the acquisition of a controlled subsidiary  measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
the company is required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas r on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  as well as for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specificially  sfas clarifies that noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of the company has million at december   and million at december   of minority interest classified as noncurrent liabilities  upon adoption of sfas  these amounts will be classified as part of shareholders equity 
accordingly  the adoption of this standard will increase equity and decrease liabilities  however  the company does not currently expect that the implementation of sfas will have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations have activities in approximately countries 
these operations expose the company to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial and commodity exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company periodically uses various derivative and non derivative financial instruments  as discussed below  to hedge its interest rate  commodity prices and foreign currency exposures when appropriate 
the risk that counterparties to these instruments may be unable to perform is minimized by limiting the counterparties used to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings 
the company does not expect to incur a loss from the failure of any counterparty to perform under the agreements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than hedging underlying financial or commercial exposures 
the sensitivity analyses discussed below for the market risk exposures were based on the facts and circumstances in effect at december  actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under management s control and could vary materially from those disclosed 
interest rate risk the company uses both fixed and floating rate debt and leases to finance its operations 
floating rate obligations  including the company s revolving facility  expose the company to fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
fixed rate obligations  including the company s dominion terminal associates debt  are subject to fluctuations in fair values as a result of changes in interest rates 
based on the contractual interest rates on the floating rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in rates would increase cash outflows by approximately million over a twelve month period 
in other words  the company s weighted average interest rate on its floating rate instruments was per annum at december  if that average rate were to increase by percentage points to  the cash outflows associated with these instruments would increase by million annually 
the effect on the fair value of the company s dominion terminal associates debt for a hypothetical decrease in the yield curve from year end levels would result in a million increase in the fair value of this debt 
foreign currency risk the company  primarily through its brink s operations  has exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the results of all of its foreign operations 
the company s foreign operations generally use local currencies to conduct business but their results are reported in us dollars 
the company is exposed periodically to the foreign currency rate fluctuations that affect transactions not denominated in the functional currency of domestic and foreign operations 
to mitigate these exposures  the company  from time to time  enters into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries since such investments are long term in nature 
the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous appreciation in the us dollar from year end levels against all other currencies of countries in which the company has continuing operations are as follows hypothetical effects in millions increase decrease translation of earnings into us dollars transactional exposures translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries the hypothetical foreign currency effects above detail the consolidated impact of a simultaneous change in the value of a large number of foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar 
the foreign currency exposure impact related to a change in an individual currency could be significantly different
