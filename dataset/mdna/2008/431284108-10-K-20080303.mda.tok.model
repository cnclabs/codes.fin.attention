we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed equity reit that provides leasing  management  development  construction and other customer related services for our properties and for third parties 
as of december   we owned or had an interest in in service office  industrial and retail properties  encompassing approximately million square feet and rental residential units 
as of that date  we also owned development land and other properties under development as described under business and properties above 
we are based in raleigh  north carolina  and our properties and development land are located in florida  georgia  iowa  kansas  maryland  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
results of operations approximately of our rental and other revenue from continuing operations in was derived from our office properties 
as a result  while we own and operate a limited number of industrial  retail and residential properties  our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing and operating our office properties 
furthermore  since approximately of our annualized revenues from office properties come from properties located in florida  georgia  north carolina and tennessee  economic growth in those states is and will continue to be an important determinative factor in predicting our future operating results 
the key components affecting our rental revenue stream are dispositions  acquisitions  new developments placed in service  average occupancy and rental rates 
average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth  as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases 
average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth  when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space 
asset acquisitions  dispositions and new developments placed in service directly impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy  depending upon the occupancy rate of the properties that are acquired  sold or placed in service 
a further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio 
as a result  in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space  we also must concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing leases on expiring space 
for more information regarding our lease expirations  see properties lease expirations 
whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether rents under new leases signed are higher or lower than the rents under the previous leases 
the average rental rate per square foot on second generation renewal and relet leases signed in our wholly owned properties compared to the rent under the previous leases based on straight line rental rates was higher in  higher in and lower in the annualized rental revenues from second generation leases signed during any particular year is generally less than of our total annual rental revenues 
our expenses primarily consist of rental property expenses  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operation of rental properties and include expenses that vary somewhat proportionately to occupancy levels  such as common area maintenance and utilities  and expenses that do not vary based on occupancy  such as property taxes and insurance 
depreciation and amortization is a non cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year  unless we buy  place in service  or sell assets  since we depreciate our properties and related building and tenant improvement assets on a straight line basis over a fixed life 
general and administrative expenses  net of amounts capitalized  consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs  corporate overhead and long term incentive compensation 
interest expense depends upon the amount of our borrowings  the weighted average interest rates on our debt and the amount of interest capitalized on development projects 
liquidity and capital resources we incur capital expenditures to lease space to our customers and to maintain the quality of our properties to successfully compete against other properties 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize the space for the specific needs of the customer 
lease commissions are costs incurred to find the customer for the space 
lease incentives are costs paid to or on behalf of tenants to induce them to enter into leases and that do not relate to customizing the space for the tenant s specific needs 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a customer to maintain the buildings 
as leases expire  we either attempt to relet the space to an existing customer or attract a new customer to occupy the space 
generally  customer renewals require lower leasing capital expenditures than reletting to new customers 
however  market conditions such as supply of available space on the market  as well as demand for space  drive not only customer rental rates but also tenant improvement costs 
leasing capital expenditures are amortized over the term of the lease  and building improvements are depreciated over the appropriate useful life of the assets acquired 
both are included in depreciation and amortization in results of operations 
because we are a reit  we are required under the federal tax laws to pay dividends to our stockholders equal to at least of our annual reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
we generally use rents received from customers and proceeds from sales of non core development land to fund our operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures and stockholder dividends 
to fund property acquisitions  development activity or building renovations  we may sell other assets and may incur debt from time to time 
as of december   we had million of secured debt outstanding and million of unsecured debt outstanding 
our debt generally consists of mortgage debt  unsecured debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december  and february   we had approximately million and million  respectively  of additional borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility  and we had approximately million and million  respectively  of additional borrowing availability under our secured revolving construction loan facilities 
our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding long term unsecured debt securities require us to satisfy various operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
as a result  to ensure that we do not violate the provisions of these debt instruments  we may from time to time be limited in undertaking certain activities that may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders  such as repurchasing capital stock  acquiring additional assets  increasing the total amount of our debt or increasing stockholder dividends 
we review our current and expected operating results  financial condition and planned strategic actions on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring our continued compliance with these covenants and ratios 
any unwaived event of default could result in an acceleration of some or all of our debt  severely restrict our ability to incur additional debt to fund short and long term cash needs or result in higher interest expense 
to generate additional capital to fund our growth and other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property  we may sell some of our properties or contribute them to joint ventures 
when we create a joint venture with a partner  we usually contribute cash or wholly owned assets to a newly formed entity in which we retain an equal or minority interest 
the joint venture itself will frequently borrow money on its own behalf to finance the acquisition of  and or leverage the return upon  the properties being acquired by the joint venture or to build or acquire additional buildings 
such borrowings are typically on a non recourse or limited recourse basis 
we generally are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our partners are required to agree to customary exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain debt guarantees 
we have historically also sold additional common stock or preferred stock or issued common units to fund additional growth or to reduce our debt  but we have limited those efforts since because funds generated from our capital recycling program in recent years have provided sufficient funds to satisfy our liquidity needs 
in addition  we have recently used funds from our capital recycling program to redeem or repurchase common units and preferred stock for cash 
in the future  we may from time to time retire some or all of our remaining outstanding preferred stock through redemptions  open market repurchases  privately negotiated acquisitions or otherwise 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in february we paid off the million of unsecured notes that matured on february   and we obtained a new million three year unsecured term loan from a group of banks with interest at libor plus basis points  the proceeds were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for short term investments 
we have no further debt maturities in  other than normal principal amortization on certain of secured loans 
as noted above  as of february   we have million of availability combined under our revolving credit and revolving construction facilities 
results of operations comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions 
as noted above and as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as required by sfas no 
 results for the year ended december  were reclassified from previously reported amounts to reflect in discontinued operations the operations for those properties sold in which qualified for discontinued operations presentation 
year ended december  to change of change rental and other revenues operating expenses rental property and other expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of assets held for use general and administrative total operating expenses interest expenses contractual amortization of deferred financing costs financing obligations other income expense interest and other income settlement of bankruptcy claim loss on debt extinguishments income before disposition of property  insurance gain  minority interest and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates gains on disposition of property  net gain from property insurance settlement minority interest equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest net gains on sales of discontinued operations  net of minority interest release of fasb fin tax liability net income dividends on preferred stock excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value net income available for common stockholders rental and other revenues the increase in rental and other revenues from continuing operations was primarily the result of the contribution from development properties placed in service in the latter part of and in  higher average occupancy in as compared to  and higher average rental rates in compared to there was modest but steady positive absorption of office space in most of our markets during also  we expect to deliver approximately million of new office and industrial development properties by the end of  which are pre leased 
we expect to sell additional non core properties in that will probably be classified as discontinued operations 
rental property and other expenses the increase in rental and other operating expenses primarily was a result of general inflationary increases in certain operating expenses  which include utility costs  insurance  real estate taxes  salaries  and benefits  and from expenses of development properties placed in service in and operating margin  defined as rental and other revenues less rental property and other expenses expressed as a percentage of rental and other revenues  increased from in to in this increase in margin was primarily attributed to higher average occupancy combined with certain operating expenses  such as taxes and insurance  being relatively fixed in the short term 
we expect rental and other operating expenses to increase in as compared to from anticipated inflationary increases in certain operating expenses  particularly higher real estate taxes and utility costs  and by operating expenses of the development properties placed in service during and the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily results from development properties placed in service in and in in  a land parcel had indicators of impairment where the carrying value exceeded the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
therefore  impairment of assets held for use aggregating million was recorded in the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher write offs of deferred development costs on projects that did not proceed or are deemed unlikely to occur in the future  higher annual and long term incentive compensation costs  higher salary and fringe benefit costs from annual employee wage and salary increases  and inflationary effects on other general and administrative expenses 
interest expense contractual interest expense is shown net of amounts capitalized to development projects 
the net decrease in contractual interest was primarily due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   partly offset by an increase in average borrowings from  million in the year ended december  to  million in the year ended december  in addition  capitalized interest in was approximately million higher compared to due to increased development activity and higher average construction and development costs 
interest allocated to discontinued operations was million in total interest expense is expected to increase in primarily from higher average borrowings compared to due to expected borrowings to fund existing and future development projects 
if proceeds from property dispositions exceed cash requirements for our development and other investing activities  average debt balances in may not exceed those of average interest rates are expected to be lower in due to a projected decline in floating rates and to the retirement of million of bonds in early february through the use of less expensive floating rate debt 
settlement of bankruptcy claim in  we received a settlement of a bankruptcy claim in the amount of million related to leases with a former tenant that were terminated in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
loss on debt extinguishments in  we had million from losses on early extinguishments of debt  including our prior revolving credit facility and bank term loan  which were paid off in the second quarter of upon the closing of our current revolving credit facility 
gains on disposition of property  gain from property insurance settlement  minority interest  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net gains on dispositions of properties not classified as discontinued operations were million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   the components of net gains are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
gains are dependent on the specific assets sold  their historical cost basis and other factors  and can vary significantly from period to period 
in  we recorded a million gain from finalization of a prior year insurance claim 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
minority interest changed from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to significantly higher net income in of the operating partnership  after preferred unit distributions  compared to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million from to the increase primarily resulted from the following transactions 
in  the weston lakeside joint venture sold rental residential units  recognizing a gain of approximately million  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
five properties owned by our dlf i joint venture dlf i were sold and the joint venture recognized a gain of approximately million  resulting in an increase of approximately million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in additionally  in  dlf i received a lease termination  of which the net effect was million  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to these transactions 
these increases are offset by million of adjustments to depreciation expense related to certain of our unconsolidated affiliates 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 we classified income of million and million as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts relate to million square feet of office and industrial properties and residential units sold during and these amounts include net gains on the sale of these properties of million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded million in income from the release of a liability recorded in accordance with the adoption of fasb interpretation no

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
preferred stock dividends and excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value the decrease in preferred stock dividends and increase in excess of preferred stock redemption costs over carrying value were due to the retirement of million of preferred stock in as compared to the retirement of million of preferred stock in net income and net income available for common stockholders we recorded net income of million in compared to million in  and net income available for common stockholders of million in compared to million in  these changes resulted from the various factors described above 
comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions

these increases were partly offset by a decrease in lease termination fees from to and the recognition of eastshore as a completed sale which occurred in the third quarter of rental property and other expenses the increase in rental and other operating expenses primarily was a result of general inflationary increases in certain operating expenses  such as salaries  benefits  utility costs and real estate taxes  expenses of development properties placed in service in the latter part of and and the consolidation of the markel joint venture effective january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a result of the recognition of eastshore as a completed sale which occurred in the third quarter of operating margin  defined as rental and other revenues less rental property and other expenses expressed as a percentage of rental and other revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease in margin was primarily caused by operating expenses increasing from inflationary pressures at a higher rate than our rental revenues and operating cost recoveries 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily a result of the contribution from development properties placed in service in the latter part of and in and the consolidation of the markel joint venture effective january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease related to the recognition of eastshore as a completed sale which occurred in the third quarter of for  one land parcel had indicators of impairment where the carrying value exceeded the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
therefore  impairment of assets held for use of million was recorded in the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to higher annual and long term incentive compensation costs and from deferred compensation  a portion of which is recognized based on increases in the total return on our common stock  which was in  higher salary and fringe benefit costs from annual employee wage and salary increases  inflationary effects on other general and administrative expenses and costs related to the retirement of a certain officer at june  interest expense the decrease in contractual interest was primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings from  million in the year ended december  to  million in the year ended december   partially offset by an increase in weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  in addition  capitalized interest in was approximately million higher compared to due to increased development activity and higher average construction and development costs 
interest allocated to discontinued operations was million in compared to million in the decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs was primarily related to obtaining the new revolving credit facility in may  as discussed further in the note to the consolidated financial statements  resulting in a reduction of amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million from to the decrease in interest from financing obligations was primarily a result of the completed sale of three buildings in richmond  virginia the eastshore transaction in the third quarter of and the elimination of the related financing obligation 
partly offsetting this decrease was an increase in related to sf hiw harborview plaza lp primarily from amortization of the option discount  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
settlement of bankruptcy claim in  we received a settlement of a bankruptcy claim in the amount of million related to leases with a former tenant that were terminated in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
loss on debt extinguishments in  we had million from losses on early extinguishments of debt  including our prior revolving credit facility and bank term loan  which were paid off in the second quarter of upon the closing of our current revolving credit facility 
the million of loss in relates to loans that were paid off early in from proceeds raised from disposition activities

gains are dependent on the specific assets sold  their historical cost basis and other factors  and can vary significantly from period to period 
minority interest changed from million of income in the year ended december  to million of expense in the year ended december  in  the operating partnership had a loss from continuing operations after preferred unit distributions which caused minority interest income 
in  the operating partnership had income from continuing operations after preferred unit distributions  resulting in minority interest expense related to the operating partnership 
in addition  minority interest in includes million from the consolidation of the markel joint venture  the accounting for which changed from equity method to consolidation effective january   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primarily resulted from the consolidation of the markel joint venture in  and from million of our share of a loss on early debt extinguishment from refinancing of loans in the des moines joint ventures in the third quarter of the markel joint venture contributed million to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december  in addition  capitalization of interest ceased and full depreciation commenced beginning december for the office property in the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture which caused an approximate million reduction in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in compared to discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no

liquidity and capital resources statement of cash flows as required by gaap  we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
the following table sets forth the changes in our cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows in calculating cash flow from operating activities  depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses  are added back to net income 
as a result  we have historically generated a significant positive amount of cash from operating activities 
from period to period  cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income  as discussed more fully above under results of operations  changes in receivables and payables  and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio  which affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash provided by or used in investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements and our acquisition  development  disposition and joint venture activity 
during periods of significant net acquisition and or development activity  our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities  which typically consists of cash received upon the sale of properties and distributions of capital from our joint ventures 
cash used in financing activities generally relates to stockholder dividends  distributions on common units  incurrence and repayment of debt and sales  repurchases or redemptions of common stock  common units and preferred stock 
as discussed previously  we use a significant amount of our cash to fund stockholder dividends and common unit distributions 
whether or not we have increases in the outstanding balances of debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition  disposition  development and joint venture activity 
we use our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes  which means that during any given period  in order to minimize interest expense  we will likely record significant repayments and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities in compared to the same period in was primarily the result of higher cash flows from net income as adjusted for changes in gains on disposition of properties  a gain from a property insurance settlement  minority interest  and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
in addition  the net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in an million increase in cash provided by operating activities from to the decrease of million in cash provided by investing activities in compared to the same period in was primarily a result of a million decrease in proceeds from dispositions of real estate assets and a million increase in additions to real estate assets and deferred leasing costs 
in addition  changes in restricted cash and other investing activities resulted in a decrease of million primarily due to cash received from escrow during relating to a collateral substitution on an existing secured loan and outflows of cash in related to proceeds from dispositions which were set aside and designated for potential future tax deferred real estate transactions and for the short term purchase of tax increment financing bonds related to an office building and garage constructed by us 
partly offsetting these decreases were proceeds of million which were received in for a property insurance settlement 
the decrease of million in cash used in financing activities in compared to the same period in was primarily a result of a million increase in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility and mortgages and notes payable and an increase of million due to contributions from our minority interest partners see note to the consolidated financial statements for compared to these decreases were partly offset by a million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock  an increase of million of cash used for the redemption and repurchase of preferred stock and an increase of million for cash used in connection with the repurchase of common units from to during  we expect to have positive cash flows from operating activities 
the net cash flows from investing activities in are expected to be negative as cash inflows from property dispositions and joint ventures are expected to be less than cash used for development  capitalized leasing and tenant improvement costs 
net cash flows from operating and investing activities combined in are expected to be positive and  together with positive financing cash flows from new debt borrowings or other sources  will be used to pay stockholder and unitholder distributions  scheduled debt maturities  principal amortization payments and any other reductions of debt and preferred stock balances see note to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   our outstanding mortgages and notes payable and financing obligations were secured by real estate assets with an aggregate undepreciated book value of approximately billion 
we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured debt upon maturity

this liability represents a financing obligation to our joint venture partner as a result of accounting for this transaction as a financing arrangement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in connection with tax increment financing for construction of a public garage related to an office building constructed by us  we are obligated to pay fixed special assessments over a year period 
the net present value of these assessments  discounted at  which represents the interest rate of the underlying bond  is shown as a financing obligation in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also receive special tax revenues and property tax rebates recorded in interest and other income which are intended  but not guaranteed  to provide funds to pay the special assessments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion included in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
represents a fixed obligation we owe our partner in highwoods dlf  lp 
this obligation arose from an excess contribution from our partner at the formation of the joint venture  and the net present value of the fixed obligation discounted at which represents the interest rate derived from the agreement  is recorded in other liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this amount represents our estimate of contractual obligations as of december  related to various construction projects 
preferred stock transactions on may   we redeemed million of our outstanding series b preferred shares  aggregating million plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
in connection with this redemption  the million excess of the redemption cost over the net carrying amount of the redeemed shares was recorded as a reduction to net income available for common shareholders in the second quarter of on august   we repurchased and retired  of our outstanding series a preferred shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with this repurchase  the million excess of the purchase cost over the net carrying amount of the repurchased shares was recorded as a reduction to net income available for common shareholders in the third quarter of debt financing activity our million unsecured revolving credit facility is initially scheduled to mature on may  assuming no default exists  we have an option to extend the maturity date by one additional year and  at any time prior to may   may request increases in the borrowing availability under the credit facility by up to an additional million 
the interest rate is libor plus basis points and the annual base facility fee is basis points 
as of december  and february   we had million and million  respectively  borrowed on this revolving credit facility 
on march   the operating partnership issued million aggregate principal amount of notes due march   net of original issue discount of million 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay borrowings outstanding under an unsecured non revolving credit facility that was obtained on january  which was subsequently terminated and under the revolving credit facility 
on december   we closed a million secured revolving construction facility 
the loan matures on december  the interest rate is based on libor plus basis points 
at december  and february   there were no amounts outstanding on this revolving facility 
on february   we paid off at maturity million of unsecured notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we closed a million three year term loan that bears interest at libor plus basis points 
proceeds from this loan were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for short term investments 
our revolving credit facility and the indenture that governs our outstanding notes require us to comply with customary operating covenants and various financial and operating ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all such requirements 
although we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants and ratios for at least the next year  depending upon our future operating performance  property and financing transactions and general economic conditions  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance 
if any of our lenders ever accelerated outstanding debt due to an event of default  we would not be able to borrow any further amounts under our revolving credit facility  which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations 
if our debt cannot be paid  refinanced or extended at maturity or upon acceleration  in addition to our failure to repay our debt  we may not be able to make distributions to stockholders at expected levels or at all 
furthermore  if any refinancing is done at higher interest rates  the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flows and ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that would restrict our ability to take actions that would otherwise be in our stockholders best interest  such as funding new development activity  making opportunistic acquisitions  repurchasing our securities or paying dividends 
on june   two three year secured construction loans totaling million with interest at basis points over libor were obtained by rees  a consolidated joint venture see note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsequently  on july   rees obtained an additional million  three year secured construction loan with interest at basis points over libor 
in october  we paid off one of the original secured construction loans  which had accounted for million of the original million 
at december  and february   million and million  respectively  was outstanding under the two remaining loans 
during  we also paid off million  excluding any normal debt amortization  of secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
approximately million of real estate assets based on undepreciated cost basis became unencumbered after paying off the secured debt 
current and future cash needs rental and other revenues are our principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements  which primarily consist of operating expenses  debt service  stockholder dividends  any guarantee obligations and recurring capital expenditures 
in addition  we could incur tenant improvement costs and lease commissions related to any releasing of vacant space 
as of the date of this filing  other than principal amortization on certain secured loans  we have no outstanding debt that matures prior to the end of we expect to fund our short term liquidity needs through a combination of available working capital  cash flows from operations and the following the selective disposition of non core land and other assets  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and revolving construction facilities which have million and million of availability  respectively  as of february   the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which would have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  the issuance of secured debt  and the issuance of unsecured debt 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of capital expenditures to lease space to our customers  maintain the quality of our existing properties and build new properties 
capital expenditures include tenant improvements  building improvements  new building completion costs and land infrastructure costs 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize space for the specific needs of first generation and second generation customers 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a specific customer to maintain existing buildings 
new building completion costs relate to the construction of new buildings 
land infrastructure costs are incurred to prepare development land for future development activity that is not specifically related to a single building 
excluding recurring capital expenditures for leasing costs and tenant improvements and for normal building improvements  our expected future capital expenditures for started and or committed new development projects were approximately million at december  a significant portion of these future expenditures are currently subject to binding contractual arrangements 
our long term liquidity needs also include the funding of development commitments  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and long term unsecured debt 
our goal is to maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities and partnership interests by the company and the operating partnership  borrowings under other secured construction loans that we may enter into  as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as mentioned above  we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities or from proceeds from sales of properties 
notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global credit markets  such as widening credit spreads and tightening underwriting standards which have negatively impacted the availability of capital across many industries  we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
stockholder dividends to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must pay dividends to stockholders that are at least of our annual reit taxable income  excluding capital gains 
reit taxable income  the calculation of which is determined by the federal tax laws  does not equal net income under gaap 
the minimum dividend per share of common stock required for the company to maintain its reit status excluding any net capital gains was per share in aggregate dividends paid on preferred stock exceeded reit taxable income excluding capital gains in  which resulted in no required dividend on common stock in for reit qualification purposes 
we generally expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for dividends to stockholders and for payment of recurring capital expenditures 
future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors 
the following factors will affect our cash flows and  accordingly  influence decisions of the board of directors regarding dividends debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  operating expenses and capital replacement needs  including tenant improvements and leasing costs  and sales of properties and non core land 
off balance sheet arrangements we have several off balance sheet joint venture and guarantee arrangements 
the joint ventures were formed with unrelated investors to generate additional capital to fund property acquisitions  repay outstanding debt  fund other strategic initiatives and lessen the risks typically associated with owning of a property 
when we create a joint venture with a partner  we usually contribute cash or wholly owned assets to a newly formed entity in which we retain an equal or minority interest 
for financial reporting purposes  certain assets we sold have been accounted for as financing arrangements 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we generally account for our investments in less than majority owned joint ventures  partnerships and limited liability companies under the equity method of accounting 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet and the results of operations of these joint ventures are not included on our income statement  other than as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates

financing arrangements the following summarizes significant sale transactions in and that were or continue to be accounted for as financing arrangements under paragraphs through of sfas no 
during the years ended december   and sf hiw harborview plaza  lp on september   we contributed harborview plaza  an office building in tampa  florida  to sf hiw harborview plaza  lp harborview lp  a newly formed entity  in exchange for a limited partnership interest and million in cash 
the other partner contributed million of cash and a new loan was obtained by the partnership for million 
in connection with this disposition  we entered into a master lease agreement with harborview lp for five years on the then vacant space in the building approximately of the building  occupancy was at december  we also guaranteed to harborview lp the payment of tenant improvements and lease commissions of million 
our maximum exposure to loss under the master lease agreement was million at september   this guarantee expired on september  additionally  our partner in harborview lp was granted the right to put its equity interest in harborview lp to us in exchange for cash at any time during the one year period commencing september  the value of the equity interest will be determined at the time that such partner elects to exercise its put right  if ever  based upon the then fair market value of harborview lp s assets and liabilities  less  which amount was intended to cover the normal costs of a sale transaction 
because of the put option  this transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction as described in note accordingly  the assets  liabilities and operations related to harborview plaza  the property owned by harborview lp  including any new financing by the partnership  remain in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have established a financing obligation equal to the net equity contributed by the other partner 
at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the financing obligation is adjusted to equal the greater of the original financing obligation or the current fair value of the put option discussed above 
the estimated fair value of the put option was million at december  this amount is adjusted by a related valuation allowance account  which is being amortized prospectively through september as interest expense on financing obligation 
the amount of the financing obligation together with the valuation allowance was million at december  additionally  the net income from the operations before depreciation of harborview plaza allocable to the partner is recorded as interest expense on financing obligation 
we continue to depreciate the property and record all of the depreciation on our books 
any payments made under the master lease agreement were expensed as incurred million  million and million was expensed during the years ended december   and  respectively and any amounts paid under the tenant improvement and lease commission guarantee are capitalized and amortized to expense over the remaining lease term 
at such time as the put option expires or is otherwise terminated  we will record the transaction as a sale and recognize gain on sale 
eastshore on november   we sold three buildings located in richmond  virginia the eastshore transaction for a total price of million in cash 
each of the properties was leased on a triple net basis to capital one services  inc  a subsidiary of capital one financial services  inc in connection with the sale  we guaranteed any shortfalls that may be incurred in the payment of rent and re tenanting costs for a five year period from the date of sale through november 
our maximum exposure to loss under the rental guarantee agreements was million at the date of sale 
payments made under this guarantee were as follows and none  million  million  million  and through the guarantee termination date million 
these rent guarantees were a form of continuing involvement as discussed in paragraph of sfas no 
because the guarantees covered the entire space occupied by a single tenant under a triple net lease arrangement  our guarantees were considered a guaranteed return on the buyer s investment for an extended period of time 
therefore  the transaction had been accounted for as a financing transaction following the accounting method described in note to the consolidated financial statements through july accordingly  through july  the assets  liabilities and operations were included in the consolidated financial statements  and a financing obligation of million was recorded  which represented the amount received from the buyer  adjusted for subsequent activity 
the income from the operations of the properties  other than depreciation  was allocated to the owner as interest expense on financing obligations 
payments made under the rent guarantees were charged to expense as incurred 
this transaction was recorded as a completed sale transaction in july when the maximum exposure to loss under the guarantees became less than the related deferred gain  accordingly  million in gain was recognized in the last six months of  million in gain was recognized in and million in gain was recognized in as the maximum exposure under the guarantees was reduced 
payments made under rent guarantees after july were recorded as a reduction of the deferred gain 
interest rate hedging activities to meet  in part  our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these interest rate hedge contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
during  we entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swaps for a one year period with respect to an aggregate of million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
these swaps fix the underlying day libor rate under which interest on such borrowings is based at 
these swaps were not designated as hedges as of december  under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the swaps were accounted for as non hedge derivatives as of december   and an aggregate unrealized loss of million was recognized in for these two swaps 
in january  we entered into two additional floating to fixed interest rate swaps for a one year period with respect to an aggregate of million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt 
these swaps fix the underlying libor rate under which interest on such borrowings is based at for million of borrowings and for million of borrowings 
these swaps were designated as hedges under sfas no 
accordingly  the swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  however  certain of our significant accounting policies contain an increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following real estate and related assets  sales of real estate  allowance for doubtful accounts  and property operating expense recoveries 
real estate and related assets real estate and related assets are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
renovations  replacements and other expenditures that improve or extend the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and depreciable land infrastructure costs  years for building improvements and five to seven years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized using the straight line method over initial fixed terms of the respective leases  which generally are from three to years 
expenditures directly related to the development and construction of real estate assets are included in net real estate assets and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
our capitalization policy on development properties is in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties  sfas no 
 capitalization of interest costs  and sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
development expenditures include pre construction costs essential to the development of properties  development and construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
interest and other carrying costs are capitalized until the building is ready for its intended use 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and ready for its intended use upon the completion of tenant improvements 
interest and other carrying costs are capitalized until the building is ready for its intended use  but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion that is substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
expenditures directly related to the leasing of properties are included in deferred leasing costs and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
we capitalize initial direct costs related to our leasing efforts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
internal leasing costs include primarily compensation  benefits and other costs such as legal fees related to leasing activities that are incurred in connection with successfully securing leases on the properties 
capitalized leasing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the initial fixed terms of the respective leases  which generally are from three to years 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful activities are expensed as incurred 
changes in our estimates regarding the successful efforts of leasing could result in changes that impact earnings 
we record liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin for the performance of asset retirement activities when the obligation to perform such activities is unconditional  whether or not the timing or method of settlement of the obligation may be conditional on a future event 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets such as land  buildings and tenant improvements  intangible assets such as above and below market leases  acquired in place leases and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates as well as available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above and below market leases acquired are recorded in other assets at their fair value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and any below market option periods 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance is adjusted through rental revenue 
in place leases acquired are recorded at their fair value in real estate and related assets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective lease 
the value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider tenant improvements  leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance of its related asset is expensed 
the value of a tenant relationship is based on our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered include the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of a tenant relationship is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the initial term and any renewal periods defined in the respective leases 
based on our acquisitions since the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we have deemed tenant relationships to be immaterial and have not allocated any amounts to this intangible asset 
we will evaluate these items in future transactions 
real estate and leasehold improvements are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held for use 
real estate is classified as held for sale when the criteria set forth in sfas no 
are satisfied  this determination requires us to make estimates and assumptions  including assessing the probability that potential sales transactions may or may not occur 
actual results could differ from those assumptions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value 
fair value of assets held for sale is equal to the estimated or contracted sales price with a potential buyer less costs to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
with respect to assets classified as held for use  if events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decline in occupancy and change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  an impairment analysis is performed 
such analysis consists of determining whether the asset s carrying amount will be recovered from its undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows  including estimated residual cash flows 
these cash flows are estimated based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property 
if the carrying amount of a held for use asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between estimated fair value of the asset and the net carrying amount 
we generally estimate the fair value of assets held for use by using discounted cash flow analysis  in some instances  appraisal information may be available and is used in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis 
as the factors used in generating these cash flows are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the discounted and or undiscounted future operating and residual cash flows estimated by us in our impairment analyses or those established by appraisal may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties held for sale and held for use 
sales of real estate we account for sales of real estate in accordance with sfas no 
for sales transactions meeting the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition  the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resultant gain or loss is recorded in the period the transaction closes 
for sales transactions that do not meet the criteria for full profit recognition  we account for the transactions in accordance with the methods specified in sfas no 
for sales transactions with continuing involvement after the sale  if the continuing involvement with the property is limited by the terms of the sales contract  profit is recognized at the time of sale and is reduced by the maximum exposure to loss related to the nature of the continuing involvement 
sales to entities in which we have or receive an interest are accounted for in accordance with partial sale accounting provisions as set forth in sfas no 
for sales transactions that do not meet sale criteria as set forth in sfas no 
 we evaluate the nature of the continuing involvement  including put and call provisions  if present  and account for the transaction as a financing arrangement  profit sharing arrangement  leasing arrangement or other alternate method of accounting  rather than as a sale  based on the nature and extent of the continuing involvement 
some transactions may have numerous forms of continuing involvement 
in those cases  we determine which method is most appropriate based on the substance of the transaction 
if we have an obligation to repurchase the property at a higher price or at a future indeterminable value such as fair market value  or we guarantee the return of the buyer s investment or a return on that investment for an extended period  we account for such transaction as a financing transaction 
if we have an option to repurchase the property at a higher price and it is likely we will exercise this option  the transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction 
for transactions treated as financings  we record the amounts received from the buyer as a financing obligation and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  are reflected as interest expense on the financing obligation 
if the transaction includes an obligation or option to repurchase the asset at a higher price  additional interest is recorded to accrete the liability to the repurchase price 
for options or obligations to repurchase the asset at fair market value at the end of each reporting period  the balance of the liability is adjusted to equal the current fair value to the extent fair value exceeds the original financing obligation 
the corresponding debit or credit will be recorded to a related discount account and the revised debt discount is amortized over the expected term until termination of the option or obligation 
if it is unlikely such option will be exercised  the transaction is accounted for under the deposit method or profit sharing method 
if we have an obligation or option to repurchase at a lower price  the transaction is accounted for as a leasing arrangement 
at such time as these repurchase obligations expire  a sale will be recorded and gain recognized 
if we retain an interest in the buyer and provide certain rent guarantees or other forms of support where the maximum exposure to loss exceeds the gain  we account for such transaction as a profit sharing arrangement 
for transactions treated as profit sharing arrangements  we record a profit sharing obligation for the amount of equity contributed by the other partner and continue to keep the property and related accounts recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations of the property  net of expenses other than depreciation net operating income  are allocated to the other partner for their percentage interest and reflected as co venture expense in our consolidated financial statements 
in future periods  a sale is recorded and profit is recognized when the remaining maximum exposure to loss is reduced below the amount of gain deferred 
discontinued operations properties that are sold or classified as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 applying the conditions of paragraph of fasb statement no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations  effective beginning in provided that the operations and cash flows of the property will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property after it is sold 
interest expense is included in discontinued operations if the related loan securing the sold property is paid off or assumed by the buyer in connection with the sale 
if the property is sold to a joint venture in which we retain an interest  the property will not be accounted for as a discontinued operation due to our significant ongoing interest in the operations through our joint venture interest 
if we are retained to provide property management  leasing and or other services for the property owner after the sale  the property generally will be accounted for as a discontinued operation because the expected cash flows related to these management and leasing activities will generally not be significant in comparison to the cash flows from the property prior to sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants as well as accrued straight line rents receivable 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenant  historical trends of the tenant and or other debtor  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
additionally  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we estimate the expected recovery through bankruptcy claims and increase the allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable and accrued straight line rents receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
property operating expense recoveries property operating cost recoveries from tenants or cost reimbursements are determined on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance cam and real estate taxes  where the tenant pays its pro rata share of operating and administrative expenses and real estate taxes 
the computation of property operating cost recovery income from tenants is complex and involves numerous judgments  including the interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation 
many tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items 
we record these payments as income each month 
we make adjustments  positive or negative  to cost recovery income to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each tenant s final cost reimbursements and  after considering amounts paid by the tenants during the year  issue a bill or credit for the appropriate amount to the tenant 
the differences between the amounts billed less previously received payments and the accrual adjustment are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  usually beginning in march and completed by mid year 
funds from operations we believe that ffo and ffo per share are beneficial to management and investors and are important indicators of the performance of any equity reit 
because ffo and ffo per share calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  management believes that the use of ffo and ffo per share  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing and investing activities 
ffo and ffo per share as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo and ffo per share as described below 
however  you should be aware that ffo and ffo per share are non gaap financial measures and therefore do not represent net income or net income per share as defined by gaap 
net income and net income per share as defined by gaap are the most relevant measures in determining our operating performance because ffo and ffo per share include adjustments that investors may deem subjective  such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
furthermore  ffo per share does not depict the amount that accrues directly to the stockholders benefit 
accordingly  ffo and ffo per share should never be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per share as indicators of our operating performance 
our calculation of ffo  which we believe is consistent with the calculation of ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and which appropriately excludes the cost of capital improvements and related capitalized interest  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  less dividends to holders of preferred stock and less excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  less gains  or plus losses  from sales of depreciable operating properties but excluding impairment losses and excluding items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis  and plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization and gains losses on sales and minority interest related to discontinued operations 
further  in calculating ffo  we add back minority interest in the income from our operating partnership  which we believe is consistent with standard industry practice for reits that operate through an upreit structure 
we believe that it is important to present ffo on an as converted basis since all of the common units not owned by the company are redeemable on a one for one basis for shares of our common stock 
other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo and ffo per share for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts amount per share amount per share amount per share funds from operations net income dividends to preferred stockholders excess of preferred stock redemption cost over carrying value net income available for common stockholders add deduct depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from operations unconsolidated affiliates depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties discontinued operations depreciation and amortization of real estate assets gains on disposition of depreciable properties minority interest from the operating partnership in income from discontinued operations release of fasb fin tax liability funds from operations weighted average shares outstanding includes assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future effects  but only indicators of reasonably possible effects 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates although some loans bear interest at variable rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the estimated aggregate fair market value of this debt at december  was  million 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of our fixed rate debt as of december  would increase by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense relating to this debt would be increased or decreased approximately million 
for a discussion of the million of interest rate swaps in effect at december   see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources interest rate hedging activities 
if libor interest rates increase or decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of these swaps as of december  would decrease or increase  respectively  by approximately million 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the swaps 
we expect the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under the swaps 
however  if a counterparty defaults on its obligations under a swap  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
