item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking disclaimer please keep in mind the forward looking disclaimer on page as you review the following discussion and analysis 
overview competitive  economic and industry factors we are an energy company 
we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own power generating plants 
we own five mines  which supply power plants 
several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines  and we sell virtually all our coal under multi year contracts 
due to the generally longer duration and terms of our contracts  we enjoy relatively stable demand and margins compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market and under shorter term contracts 
we also sell under shorter term contracts a small amount of coal produced by others 
we own the rova power project 
rova consists of two coal fired units with a total generating capacity of megawatts  or mw 
rova supplies power pursuant to long term contracts 
according to the annual energy outlook prepared by the eia  approximately of all electricity generated in the united states in was produced by coal fired units 
the eia projects that the demand for coal used to generate electricity will increase approximately per year from through consequently  we believe that the demand for coal will grow  in part because coal is the lowest cost fossil fuel used for generating electric power 
revenues and expenses in  we had an operating loss of million  of which million came from our heritage segment and million from our corporate segment  offset by million of income from our coal operations and million of income from our power operations 
challenges we believe that our principal challenges today include the following obtaining adequate capital for our on going operations  renegotiating sales prices to reflect higher market prices and fully recover increased commodity and production costs  continuing to fund high heritage health benefit expenses which continue to be adversely affected by inflation in medical costs  longer life expectancies for retirees  and the failure of the umwa retirement fund trustees to manage medical costs  maintaining and collateralizing  where necessary  our coal act and reclamation bonds  funding required contributions to pension plans that are underfunded  complying with new environmental regulations  which have the potential to significantly reduce sales from our mines  and defending against claims for potential taxes and royalties assessed by various governmental entities  most of which we believe are subject to reimbursement by our customers 
we discuss these issues  as well as the other challenges we face  elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and under risk factors 

table of contents internal control over financial reporting we are committed to maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
our accounting personnel report regularly to our audit committee on all accounting and financial matters 
in addition  our audit committee actively communicates with and oversees the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm 
we believe we remediated five of the six material weaknesses that were identified in and  in connection with the preparation of the form k and amendment no 
to our form k 
subsequent to december   we plan to remediate the material weaknesses identified with the filing of our amendment no 
to our form k 
we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
see item a  risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and related matters our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  require that we make estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have made significant judgments and estimates in connection with the following accounting matters 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the section below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in connection with our discussion of these critical accounting matters  we also use this section to present information related to these judgments and estimates 
postretirement benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligations are the obligations to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for more information about the assumptions and estimates associated with these obligations 
we estimate the total amount of these obligations with the help of third party actuaries using actuarial assumptions and information 
our estimates are sensitive to judgments we make about the discount rate  about the rate of inflation in medical costs  about mortality rates  and about the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  or the medicare reform act  on the benefits payable 
we review these estimates and the obligations at least annually 
actuarial valuations project that our heritage health benefit payments for retirees will increase annually until and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines at a rate sufficient to overcome the rate of medical cost inflation for those remaining 
beginning in  we began receiving medicare part d prescription drug reimbursements 
we expect that these reimbursements will reduce our cash payments by approximately million in in order to estimate the total cost of our obligation to provide medical benefits  we must make a judgment about the rate of inflation in medical costs 
as our estimate of the rate of inflation of medical costs increases  our calculation of the total cost of providing these benefits increases 
we have assumed that health care costs would increase by in and that this rate of increase would decrease to per year in and beyond 

table of contents the effect of a one percent change on our health care cost trend rate on our postretirement medical periodic costs and benefit obligations is summarized in the table below postretirement benefits increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation one of the estimates we have made relates to the implementation of the medicare reform act 
as provided for under that act  we recognized a benefit to our anticipated future prescription drug costs for retirees and their dependents in based on a coordinated implementation of the medicare reform act and our existing benefit programs  including the umwa plan 
we adopted the subsidy approach in and continued using that approach in the subsidy approach limits our annual benefit to to a maximum of  per participant of actual costs 
we do not pay pension or black lung benefits directly 
these benefits are paid from trusts that we established and funded 
as of december   our pension trusts were underfunded  and we expect to contribute approximately million to these trusts in as of december   our black lung trust was overfunded by million 
asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and the reclamation of land upon cessation of mining 
we account for reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
asset retirement obligations  or sfas this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which we incur that obligation 
we capitalize the present value of our estimated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
certain of the company s customers have either agreed to reimburse the company for reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
these funds will serve as sources for use in final reclamation activities 
the liability asset retirement obligations on our consolidated balance sheet represents our estimate of the present value of the cost of closing our mines and reclaiming land disturbed by mining 
this liability increases as land is mined and decreases as reclamation work is performed and cash expended 
the asset  property  plant and equipment capitalized asset retirement costs  remains constant until new liabilities are incurred or old liabilities are re estimated 
we estimate the future costs of reclamation using standards for mine reclamation that have been established by the government agencies that regulate our operations as well as our own experience in performing reclamation activities 
these estimates can and do change 
developments in our mining program also affect this estimate by influencing the timing of reclamation expenditures 
we amortize our development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs  and some plant and equipment using the units of production method based on estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for current information about these obligations and costs 
income taxes and deferred income taxes as of january   we adopted interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the 
table of contents financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
upon adoption of fin  we did not identify any uncertain tax positions and no tax reserve was recorded as of january  we have elected under fin to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses  or nols  alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we have reduced our deferred income tax assets by a full valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is primarily an estimate of the deferred tax assets that will more likely than not expire before they can be realized in the future by our current operations existing as of december  these estimates and judgments are reviewed annually and when new  material events  such as an acquisition  take place within the company 
the company believes it will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by its mining operations 
as a result  the company has determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of its regular federal net operating loss carryforwards  since they are not available to reduce amt income in the future 
the company has also determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all its amt credit carryforwards  since they are only available to offset future regular income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has determined that since its net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and the company is unable to forecast that it will have taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets 
the company has also therefore recorded a full valuation allowance for its state net operating losses  since it believes that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
amt nols reduce our current income tax expense each year until the amt nols have been fully used 
at december   we had fully used all of our amt nols 
the amt credits that we accumulate do not expire 
however  their value has not been recognized  and will not be recognized  until we can forecast paying regular income taxes and are therefore able to use the credits 
this will not occur until all of our regular nols are used or expire and our regular income tax exceeds our amt 
in august  the energy policy act of was enacted 
among other provisions  it contains a tax credit for the production of coal owned by indian tribes 
the credit is per ton beginning through and per ton from through  with both amounts escalating for inflation 
the credit may be used against regular corporate income tax for all years and against amt for the initial period 
the company s absaloka mine  which produces coal under a lease with the crow tribe  produces about million tons per year 
the savings are expected to be shared with the crow tribe when they are realized 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the amounts below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period after total in thousands of dollars westmoreland mining long term debt rova term debt rova acquisition debt wri term debt other debt interest on debt capital leases operating leases workers compensation combined benefit fund postretirement medical qualified pension benefits serp benefits black lung benefits reclamation costs rova coal supply agreement totals at december   westmoreland mining had deposited million in two restricted accounts as collateral for these obligations 
at december   rova had deposited million in a restricted account as collateral for these obligations 
in calculating the amount of interest on debt  we have assumed that the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt would not increase or decrease from the rates in effect at december  we have not accrued the present value of this obligation  because this plan is a multiemployer plan 
we expense our premium payments when due 
the table presents our estimate of the undiscounted benefit payments  net of the estimated medicare subsidiaries we will receive 
the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
the obligations shown above are our expected contributions to the plan assets 
the table presents our estimate of the undiscounted benefit payments 
the table presents our estimate of the undiscounted cost for final reclamation 
the accrued liability of million as of december   is on a discounted basis and will increase in present value as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability does not consider the contractual obligations at december   of our customers to perform reclamation 
the accrued liability also does not reflect million held in escrow as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of the rosebud mine 
we estimate that the present value of our net obligation for final reclamation of our mines that is  the costs of final reclamation that are not the contractual responsibilities of others is million at december  
table of contents rova has two coal supply agreements with teco coal corporation 
the amounts shown in this table assume that rova continues to purchase coal under these contracts at the current volume and does not extend these contracts and that the price per ton payable under these contracts does not increase 
financial implications of the rova acquisition in june  we acquired the interest in rova that we did not previously own 
rova sells electric power under two power sales agreements  one that expires in and one that expires in capacity charges are calculated based on a rate for each mw hour of electricity produced 
the rova i per mw hour capacity charge is fixed through and then steps down to a new lower rate in may through the end of the power sales agreement in the rova ii per mw hour capacity charge is fixed through and then steps down to a new lower rate in june through the end of the power sales agreement in rova s indebtedness was structured so that rova s principal and interest payments are relatively higher through and relatively lower thereafter 
rova s power sales agreements are structured to provide rova sufficient cash to repay its lenders and thus the capacity charges are relatively higher through and relatively lower thereafter 
rova s historical accounting policy for revenue recognition of these capacity charges prior to july  had been to record them as revenue as amounts were invoiced pursuant to the provisions of the power sales agreements 
as discussed below  revenue recognition rules required the company to record these capacity charges after july  ratably over the remaining term of the power sales agreements  irrespective of when the amounts are billed and collected 
this change  while having no effect on cash flow or total revenue recognized over the remaining term of the power sales agreements  had a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of revenue and income at rova 
these two power sales agreements were entered into prior to the effective date of emerging issues task force  or eitf   revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts and eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 
accordingly  rova s power sales agreements were not subject to the accounting requirements of these pronouncements 
the completion of the rova acquisition triggered the two power sales agreements to be within the scope of eitf under eitf  each of the power sales agreements is considered to contain a lease within the scope of sfas  accounting for leases 
each such lease is classified as an operating lease 
as a result  we must recognize revenue for future capacity charges ratably over the remaining term of the power sales agreements 
in our historical financial statements  earnings from our original interest in rova appeared as independent power projects equity in earnings because rova was an equity method affiliate 
because we now own of rova  it is now fully consolidated in our financial statements 
substantial debt was incurred to finance rova s development 
we incurred million of indebtedness to fund the rova acquisition 
for more information about this indebtedness  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on march   westmoreland partners  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  completed a refinancing with the prudential insurance company of america and prudential investment management  inc of the rova energy project units i ii 
the refinancing provides for approximately million of fixed rate term debt with interest rates varying from to 
the required payments for the fixed rate term debt are million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the term debt is to be fully repaid before the end of the refinancing also provides for approximately million in floating rate debt with a final maturity no later than january  the refinancing paid off all outstanding bank borrowings  bond borrowings  and the rova acquisition loan and eliminated the need for the irrevocable letters of credit  which supported the bond borrowings 
the company received a million cash distribution from rova as part of the refinancing 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources westmoreland coal company is an energy company 
the company s current principal activities  all conducted within the united states  are the production and sale of coal from its mines in montana  north dakota and texas  and the ownership of power plants 
the company s activities are primarily conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries  which generally have obtained separate financing 
the major factors impacting the company s liquidity are payments due on the term loan it entered into to acquire various operations and assets from montana power and knife river in may see note and subsequent borrowings at wml  which owns four of our mines  payments due on the project debt payable by the partnership which owns the mw rova power plant see note  payments due on the term loan and revolving credit facility used to acquire the minority interest in wri and to repay certain then existing debt of wcc  cash collateral requirements for additional reclamation bonds in new mining areas  payments for the company s heritage health benefit costs  and ongoing reclamation costs 
at december   the current maturities of the company s long term debt are approximately million  of which approximately million relates to rova debt  which was refinanced subsequent to december  see note 
unforeseen changes in the company s ongoing business requirements could also impact its liquidity 
the principal sources of cash flow to wcc are distributions from wri  rova  and from wml  all of which are subject to the restrictions contained in their respective debt agreements 
on march   the company completed the sale of million in senior secured convertible notes to an existing shareholder 
the notes mature five years from date of issuance  carry a interest rate and are convertible into the company s common stock at the noteholders option at an initial conversion price of per share 
on march   the company completed the refinancing of the rova project with an institutional lender 
the refinancing included the loan used to acquire the additional interest in the rova project in and all of the term loans outstanding at rova 
the refinancing allowed rova to make a distribution to the company of million when the refinancing closed 
as of march   the company believes that it has capital resources or committed financing arrangements in place to provide adequate liquidity to meet all of its currently projected cash requirements through august based on its most recent forecast 
the company is considering several alternatives for raising additional capital during the company has also engaged a large bank to assist the company in refinancing its existing debt at wml  with the goal of better matching debt amortization with cash flow from the mining operations 
the refinancing would be designed to provide for additional availability to finance future capital requirements of the mines  and provide for an increase in the amounts allowed to be distributed to wcc 
while the company has had initial discussions with the bank and potential lenders about the refinancing  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain the refinancing on terms acceptable to it  or at all 
depending upon the size and terms of that potential refinancing  the company will evaluate the need to raise additional capital 
the company continues to believe that one of the other alternatives available to it is the sale of one or more of the company s assets 
there can be no assurance that any sale could be completed on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to the company 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding the company s ability to raise additional capital  refinance its debt obligations or sell some of its assets to meet its obligations 

table of contents nrgt long term contract on september   our subsidiary twcc  which operates the jewett mine  entered into a new lignite supply agreement with nrg texas power llc  or nrg texas 
the new agreement commenced on january   and runs through december  as part of the agreement  nrg texas has the right to terminate the supply agreement on december st of any year prior to the th day of that year 
nrg texas also has the option to extend the agreement through december   provided the mine still has coal reserves 
under the terms of the agreement  nrg texas shall reimburse twcc for all mining costs actually incurred in mining previously agreed volumes for each year 
in addition  nrg texas will pay twcc management fees based on the volume of lignite delivered per year 
additionally  under the terms of the agreement  nrg texas is responsible for the payment of final reclamation at the jewett mine  and will pay twcc for all costs of final reclamation plus a profit component for work performed by twcc 
as a result of this agreement on final reclamation  twcc increased its contractual third party reclamation receivable to reflect the fact that effective january  all costs incurred by twcc towards fulfilling its asset retirement obligation will be reimbursed by nrg texas 
the increase to twcc s contractual third party reclamation receivable was offset by a corresponding decrease in twcc s capitalized asset retirement costs 
factors affecting our liquidity our health benefit costs consist primarily of payments for postretirement medical and workers compensation benefits 
we are also obligated for employee pension cbf  and pneumoconiosis benefits 
it is important to note that retiree health benefit costs are directly affected by increases in medical service costs  prescription drug costs and mortality rates 
the most recent actuarial valuations of our postretirement medical benefit obligations  which pertain primarily to former employees who worked in our eastern mines and are guaranteed life time benefits under the federal coal act  indicated that our postretirement medical benefit payments would increase annually through and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
the following table shows the payments we made and the medicare part d subsidies we received in  and the expected payments and subsidies for actual expected payments payments and receipts and receipts in millions postretirement medical benefits pension contributions cbf premiums workers compensation benefits medicare d subsidies received the financing obtained in conjunction with the wml acquisitions requires quarterly interest and principal payments of approximately million during the first three quarters of  and a million final principal and interest payment in the fourth quarter of this debt financing also requires that of the excess cash flow  as defined  be set aside to fund the fourth quarter debt payment  which is due in december therefore  only of wml s excess cash flow is available to the company until this debt is paid off in wml also entered into the add on debt facility in  which requires the use of approximately million of cash each quarter for debt service 
the add on facility permitted wml to undertake significant capital projects  without adversely affecting cash available to westmoreland coal company 
the terms of the add on facility permitted wml to distribute million to westmoreland coal company 
in when wml entered into the add on facility  it also extended its revolving credit facility to and reduced the amount of the facility to million 
in december  wml amended the revolving 
table of contents facility to increase the borrowing base to million and to extend its maturity to april to better align with its operating needs 
the increase includes the ability to issue letters of credit up to million  which wml expects to use for reclamation bond collateral requirements 
as of december   a letter of credit for million was supported by wml s revolving credit facility  wml had borrowed million against the facility and million was available as of that date 
in june  we acquired the interest in rova that we did not previously own 
this acquisition was funded with million in acquisition debt as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we extended the term of the acquisition debt to four years 
at december   the outstanding balance of the rova acquisition debt was million net of million of debt discount 
rova also has project level debt  which funded the original development of the power plants 
the project level debt requires semi annual principal payments as also described in note to the financial statements as well as ongoing interest payments 
until that debt is paid in full  all cash distributions generated by rova were to be applied to the acquisition debt  with the minimum semi annual principal payment being approximately million 
on march   we completed a refinancing  which paid off all of rova s outstanding acquisition loan  bank borrowings  and bond borrowings and eliminated the need for the irrevocable letters of credit  which supported the bond borrowings 
the payments required for the refinanced fixed rate term debt are million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the term debt will be fully paid off before the end of on march   we assumed operations of our absaloka mine from wgi  and additionally purchased from wgi mining and office equipment for million and tools  spare parts and supplies  and coal inventory for million 
as part of the transaction  wgi released the million reclamation escrow account to wri  and wri released wgi from its financial obligation to complete final reclamation of the mine 
wri made significant additional capital expenditures during and we expect we will need to make further investments in mine development projects  mining equipment and to support bonding requirements in the future 
on september   wri entered into a day term loan agreement with first interstate bank in the amount of million 
the proceeds from the term loan were used to help fund wri s redemption of wgi s ownership in wri for million 
the redemption left the company as the sole shareholder in wri 
the term loan was repaid and the loan agreement expired on october  on october   wri executed a business loan agreement  or agreement  with first interstate bank 
the agreement provides wri with term debt of million and a revolving credit facility of million 
the term debt requires sixteen quarterly payments of principal and interest with the final payment due september  the revolving credit facilities mature october  interest on both notes is payable at the prime rate per annum at december  
the two notes are collaterized by wri s inventory  chattel paper  accounts receivable and equipment 
the agreement requires wri to comply with certain covenants and minimum financial ratio requirements related to debt service coverage  tangible net worth and capital expenditures 
wcc is guarantor of the notes 
the agreement replaces the revolving lines of credit of million to wcc 
the outstanding balance of million on the wcc line of credit facility was fully repaid to first interstate bank on october  our ongoing and future business needs may also affect liquidity 
we do not anticipate that our revenues will diminish materially as a result of any future downturn in economic conditions because rova produces relatively low cost  power and most of our coal production is sold under long term contracts  which help insulate us from unfavorable market developments 
however  contract price reopeners  contract renegotiations  contract expirations or terminations and market competition could affect future coal revenues and our liquidity 

table of contents cash balances and available credit consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled in thousands rova westmoreland risk management westmoreland mining westmoreland resources  inc other total consolidated cash and cash equivalents the cash at wml is available to the company through quarterly distributions  subject to the restrictions described above 
the cash at westmoreland risk management  our captive insurance subsidiary  is available to the company through dividends 
under the provisions of the rova acquisition loan  all cash distributions from rova subsequent to december   are to be applied to the principal balance of the loan and related interest and will therefore not be available to the company through distributions until the loan has been repaid 
the company has also engaged a large bank to assist the company in refinancing its existing debt at wml  with the goal of better matching debt amortization with cash flow from the mining operations 
the refinancing would be designed to provide for additional availability to finance future capital requirements of the mines  and provide for an increase in the amounts allowed to be distributed to wcc 
while the company has had initial discussions with the bank and potential lenders about the refinancing  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain the refinancing on terms acceptable to it  or at all 
as of december   wml had million of its million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
as of december   wri had million of its million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
restricted investments we had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of million at december  compared to million at december  the restricted cash at december  included million in rova s debt service accounts and prepayment accounts and million in westmoreland mining s debt service reserve  long term prepayment and reclamation escrow accounts  million of which we have classified as non current assets and million of which we have classified as current assets 
at december  our wri reclamation  workers compensation and postretirement medical benefit cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of million 
in addition  we had accumulated reclamation deposits of million at december   representing cash received from customers of the rosebud mine to pay for reclamation  plus interest earned on the investments 
preferred stock during  we exchanged a total of  depositary shares at an exchange ratio of shares of common stock for each depositary share  compared to the conversion ratio of provided for under the terms of the certificate of designation governing the preferred stock 
as a result of these preferred stock exchanges  million of premium on the exchange of preferred stock for common stock was recorded in  as an increase in net loss applicable to common shareholders 
this premium on the exchange of preferred stock for common stock represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred to the preferred stock holders over the value of consideration that would have been exchanged under the original conversion terms 
while we can redeem preferred shares for cash at any time for the redemption value of plus accumulated dividends  we agreed to these negotiated exchanges as a cash conservation measure and because they reduced the number of outstanding depositary shares  thereby eliminating million of accumulated dividends and associated future dividend requirements 

table of contents historical sources and uses of cash cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million for the increase in noncash charges to income  which includes depreciation  amortization  share based compensation  provision for obsolete inventory  minority interest and gains on sales of assets  in increased cash provided by operating activities by million 
the majority of this increase related to depreciation resulting from the consolidation of rova and increased capital expenditures and million of restructuring charges recorded in this increase was partially offset by the increase in net loss 
net loss was million for compared to million for cash provided by operating activities in also reflects million of revenue deferred under rova s long term sales agreements compared to million for changes in working capital increased cash provided by operating activities in by million compared to an increase in cash from changes in working capital of million in the increase in related primarily to favorable changes of million  million and million in accounts receivable  asset retirement obligation and deferred revenue accounts  respectively  partially offset by an unfavorable change of million in accounts payable 
cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million for the increase in net loss in reduced cash provided by operating activities by million  which was offset by million of increases in non cash charges to income 
cash provided by operating activities includes million invoiced under our power sales agreements  which has been recorded as deferred revenue 
cash distributions from independent power projects decreased million in  primarily because our rova distributions received after the acquisition were consolidated 
changes in working capital increased cash provided by operating activities in by million compared to an increase in cash provided from changes in working capital of million in our working capital deficit was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in our working capital deficit resulted primarily from a million increase in our current debt obligations 
decreases of million for cash and cash equivalents and million of accounts receivables also contributed to the increase in working capital deficit  partially offset by a million increase in the current portion of restricted cash and bond collateral 
our working capital deficit was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in our working capital deficit resulted primarily from the million short term rova financing  the consolidation of rova  which had million of negative working capital and the elimination of million in deferred overburden removal costs as the result of a change in accounting principle discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this accounting change had no effect on cash flows 
we used million of cash in investing activities in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by the million paid in connection with the acquisition of wgi s minority interest in our absaloka mining operations and our assumption of the mine s operations 
additions to property  plant and equipment in of million compared to million of additions in  also contributed to the increase in cash in investing activities 
these increases were partially offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of our royalty interest at the caballo mine in wyoming in february 
cash used in investing activities in was partially offset by the million received from the sale of mineral interests in colorado 
we make capital expenditures primarily to improve and replace existing mining equipment and improve the overall efficiency of mining operations 
we anticipate that capital expenditures during will range from approximately million to million 
we anticipate that we will fund these capital expenditures with available cash  cash generated from operations  and existing credit facilities 
we used million of cash in investing activities in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by our million investment for our rova acquisition net of cash acquired 
cash provided by investing activities in included million received from the sale of mineral interests 
cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment

cash flows from investing activities in also included a million increase in our restricted cash accounts  pursuant to westmoreland mining s term loan agreement and as collateral for our surety bonds 
additions to property  mine equipment  development projects and investment in a new company wide software system were million in increases in restricted cash accounts  bond collateral  and reclamation deposits were million in we used million of cash from our financing activities in compared to million provided from financing activities in in  we made million of payments on our long term debt 
in  we received million to finance the rova acquisition  which was offset by the repayment of million of our long term debt 
we received million of cash from our financing activities in this increase was primarily a result of million of borrowings to finance the rova acquisition and was offset by the repayment of million of long term debt 
cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily the result of million in borrowings under our long term debt and revolving lines of credit offset by million used for the repayment of long term debt 
severance benefits payable to former ceo in may  christopher k 
seglem was terminated as chairman  ceo and president of the company 
mr 
seglem asserts that he is entitled to payment of severance benefits under an executive severance policy dated december  the total amount of the severance benefits payable to mr 
seglem has not been determined because the executive severance policy is subject to different interpretations in regard to certain important terms 
the company and mr 
seglem have been attempting to resolve the differences in interpretation in the executive severance policy through discussions but no assurances can be given that the differences will be resolved 
if mr 
seglem were to bring litigation against the company to enforce what he believes are his rights under the executive severance policy  the company would be required to pay his attorney s fees under the terms of the policy  unless a court were to determine that under the circumstances  recovery of all or a part of any such fees would be unjust 
if mr 
seglem s interpretation of the severance policy were to be upheld by a court  he would be entitled to severance payments of approximately million plus reimbursement of his attorney s fees 
the company has recorded a reserve of million for this matter

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells commodities principally coal and electric power and purchases commodities principally diesel fuel  steel and electricity 
the company produces and sells coal through its subsidiaries  wri  wml  and westmoreland coal sales company  and the company produces and sells electricity and steam through its subsidiary wellc 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts reduce the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices 
these contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators  such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices  such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
contracts may also contain periodic price reopeners or renewal provisions  which give us the opportunity to adjust the price of our coal to reflect developments in the marketplace 
from time to time  the company enters into derivative instruments on the notional amount of the contract to manage a portion of its exposure to the price volatility of diesel fuel used in its operations 
in a typical commodity swap agreement like those to which the company was party  the company receives the difference between a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is greater than the fixed price 
if the fixed price is greater than the index price  the company pays the difference on the notional amount of the contract 
in october  the company entered into a derivative instrument to manage a portion of its exposure to the price volatility of diesel fuel to be used in its operations in the swap contract covered million gallons of diesel fuel at a weighted average fixed price of per gallon  which was settled monthly during in january  the company entered into an additional derivative instrument to be used in its operations in the swap contract covered million gallons of diesel fuel at a weighted average fixed price of per gallon  which was settled monthly during the company accounts for these derivative instruments on a mark to market basis through earnings 
the consolidated financial statements as of december  do not reflect any cumulative unrealized gains or losses on these contracts since they were fully settled during interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
the debt obligations shown in the table below are indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
based on balances outstanding as of december   a change of one percentage point in the prime interest rate or libor would increase or decrease interest expense on an annual basis by the amount shown below in thousands effect of increase or decrease company s revolving lines of credit wml s series d notes wri s term debt rova s project debt rova acquisition debt the carrying value and estimated fair value of the company s long term debt with fixed interest rates at december  were million and million  respectively 
the company s heritage health benefit expenses are also impacted by interest rate changes because its workers compensation  pension  pneumoconiosis  and postretirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
