item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle  as well as tradesmen and small businesses 
our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise equine  pet and animal products  including items necessary for their health  care  growth and containment maintenance products for agricultural and rural use hardware and tool products seasonal products  including lawn and garden power equipment truck and towing products  and work recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family 
tractor supply company stores typically range in size from  to  square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside selling space 
we are developing stores using one of five standard prototypes as well as existing building structures 
our wholly owned subsidiary  del s farm supply  llc del s  operates stores  primarily in the pacific northwest  that offer a wide selection of products primarily in the equine  pet and animal category tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle 
del s stores currently range in size from approximately  to  square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered sheltered selling space 
our current and long term growth strategy is to expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores  enhance financial performance through same store sales increases  achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an everyday low prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service  enhance product margin through assortment management  vendor management  sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs  leverage operating costs  especially occupancy  advertising and distribution  expand market opportunities via internet sales  and expand through selective acquisition  as such opportunities arise  to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth 
we have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years  with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
we plan to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in our unit count of approximately 
this growth has expanded our market presence to stores in states 
we believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future growth 
the acquisition of del s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest  primarily in washington  with three additional stores in hawaii 
we operated retail farm and ranch stores as of december  and have plans to open to stores including eight to del s stores in fiscal we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over potential additional markets for new tractor supply stores excluding del s in the united states 
we have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs  evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews  review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings 
these efforts  coupled with a strong marketing program and in depth product knowledge training of our store employees  have enhanced our sales and financial performance 
seasonality and weather our business is highly seasonal 
historically  our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products 
unseasonable weather  excessive precipitation  natural disasters  drought  and early or late frosts may also affect our sales 
we believe  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores 
we experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 

table of contents inflation although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations  we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by inflation 
we are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services  which include  among other items  steel  grain  petroleum  corn  soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services 
moreover  in the last few years  energy prices have risen dramatically  which has resulted in increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores 
we have been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation  principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation in the future 
significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our financial position and or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
description revenue recognition and sales returns we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
if we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our layaway program  the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete 
revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption 
judgments and uncertainties we estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one year rolling average of historical return trends and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales 
our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  refunds activity may vary from estimated amounts 
we recognize a benefit for gift cards when i the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer  or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote referred to as breakage or iii the unredeemed merchandise returns cards expire one year from issuance 
the gift card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card breakage 
however  if actual consumer return or gift card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our sales return reserve at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately  in fiscal a change in our assumptions regarding gift card breakage would have affected net earnings by approximately  in fiscal 
table of contents effect if actual results differ from description judgments and uncertainties assumptions inventory valuation impairment risk we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventory by evaluating turn rates  sales trends  age of merchandise  overall inventory levels and other benchmarks 
the estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value ie  an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies 
we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term 
however  changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves 
our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  overall aging  the promotional environment  historical results and current inventory loss trends 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize impairment reserves in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment 
however  if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our impairment reserve at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately  in fiscal shrinkage our stores perform physical inventories at least once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts 
this is done by assessing the chain wide average shrinkage experience rate  applied to the related periods sales volumes 
such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences 
the estimated shrink rate is based on historical experience 
we believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends 
our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical trends  loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies 
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve 
however  if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our shrinkage reserve at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately  in fiscal 
table of contents effect if actual results differ from description judgments and uncertainties assumptions vendor support we receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements  including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs 
the amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements  which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to several years 
many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product 
vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold  which is in compliance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments  as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors 
the estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels  sales trends and expected customer demand  as well as planned new store openings and relocations 
although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from estimated amounts 
our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding purchasing activity  target thresholds and vendor attrition 
at the end of each fiscal year  the estimated support is reconciled to the actual amounts earned based upon actual purchase activity 
we do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if such a reduction were to occur  the company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales 
if a reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of december   net earnings would have been affected by approximately million 
freight we incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases 
such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold 
we allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories 
this assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented 
if a increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance  net earnings would have been affected by approximately million 

table of contents effect if actual results differ from description judgments and uncertainties assumptions stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan  which includes incentive and non qualified stock options  nonvested share awards  and an employee stock purchase plan
