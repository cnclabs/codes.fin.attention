item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion of the company s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview middlesex water company has operated as a water utility in new jersey since  and in delaware  through our wholly owned subsidiary  tidewater  since we are in the business of collecting  treating  distributing and selling water for domestic  commercial  municipal  industrial and fire protection purposes 
we also operate a new jersey municipal water and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in new jersey and delaware through our subsidiaries 
we are regulated as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services  as to the quality of water service we provide and as to certain other matters in new jersey and in delaware 
only our usa  usa pa and white marsh subsidiaries are not regulated utilities 
our new jersey water utility system the middlesex system provides water services to approximately  retail customers  primarily in central new jersey 
the middlesex system also provides water service under contract to municipalities in central new jersey with a total population of approximately  in partnership with our subsidiary  usa pa  we operate the water supply system and wastewater system for the city of perth amboy  new jersey 
our other new jersey subsidiaries  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater  provide water and wastewater services to residents in southampton township  new jersey 
our delaware subsidiaries  tidewater and southern shores  provide water services to approximately  retail customers in new castle  kent and sussex counties  delaware 
our tesi subsidiary provides wastewater services to approximately  residential retail customers 
our other delaware subsidiary  white marsh  services an additional  customers in kent and sussex counties through operations and maintenance contracts 
the majority of our revenue is generated from retail and contract water services to customers in our service areas 
we record water service revenue as such service is rendered and include estimates for amounts unbilled at the end of the period for services provided after the last billing cycle 
fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary  tidewater  and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided 
we expect the growth of our regulated wastewater business in delaware will eventually become a more significant component of our operations 
our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate relief  effective cost management  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
operating results by segment the company has two operating segments  regulated and non regulated 
our regulated segment contributed  and of total revenues  and  and of net income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discussion of the company s results of operations is on a consolidated basis  and includes significant factors by subsidiary 
the segments in the tables included below are comprised of the following companies regulated middlesex  tidewater  pinelands  southern shores  and tesi  non regulated usa  usa pa  and white marsh 
results of operations in compared to millions of dollars years ended december  regulated non regulated total regulated non regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income expense interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in revenues improved by million in our tidewater system  of which million was a result of a base rate increase that was granted to tidewater 
the rate increase was implemented in two parts  a interim rate increase in june and an additional final increase on february  customer growth and higher consumption contributed million of increased revenues 
our tidewater system experienced record water production and consumption billed due to extended favorable weather during the spring and summer 
fees charged to new customers for initial connection to our delaware water systems were lower by million as new residential and commercial development has slowed in our delaware service territories 
revenues in our middlesex system increased by million as a result of a base rate increase implemented on october  middlesex revenues also increased by million due to increased sales to our contract customers 
tesi revenues increased by million  as we connected new customers to our existing and new wastewater systems in delaware 
while we anticipate continued organic customer and consumption growth among our delaware systems  such growth and increased consumption cannot be guaranteed 
our water systems are highly dependent on the effects of weather  which may adversely impact future consumption despite customer growth 
appreciable organic customer and consumption growth is less likely in our new jersey systems due to the extent to which our service territory is developed 
the company expects its operating revenues to reflect the full effect of the october middlesex million rate increase 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or 
labor costs were million higher due to wage increases and increased headcount to meet the needs of the growing delaware customer base  risk management  training and safety 
as expected  electric generation costs for our middlesex system increased due to the renewal in late of our contract with the power purveyor 
that factor accounted for most of the million in additional power costs 
pumping and water treatment costs increased a combined million due to higher costs for chemicals and disposal of residuals 
costs for water main breaks in our new jersey system and transportation fuel were million higher than the same period in due to the number and size of the breaks and higher gasoline prices

all other operating costs increased by million 
electric generation costs for our middlesex system are expected to increase in due to the renewal in late of our power contract that reflects an increase 
payroll and related employee benefit costs are expected to be higher in due to headcount increase 
however  the unit cost for our employee s health benefits will not increase until december depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
as our investments in utility plant and operating expenses increase  we continue to seek timely rate relief through base rate filings as discussed above 
other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
other income increased million  primarily due to a gain of million on the sale of non utility real property in new jersey and a gain of million on the sale of certain water service rights in delaware 
interest expense decreased by million  or  as a result of a lower level of average short term debt outstanding when compared to income tax expense based on our current year operating results was million higher than and reflects the increased revenues due to higher water rates in new jersey and delaware  the record customer usage in delaware and the sale of non essential assets 
this was partially offset by million of solar tax credits recorded during net income increased to million from million in the prior year  and basic earnings per share increased from to 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
results of operations in compared to millions of dollars years ended december  regulated non regulated total regulated non regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income expense interest expense income taxes net income operating revenues for the year rose million  or over the same period in water sales improved by million in our middlesex system  of which million was a result of base rate increase that was granted to middlesex on december  this increase was somewhat offset by lower consumption revenues of million due to unfavorable weather from mid july through the late fall of as compared to the prior year 
customer growth of in delaware provided additional water consumption sales  facility charges and connection fees of million  higher base rates provided million and increased consumption for existing customers provided an additional million 
new unregulated wastewater contracts in delaware provided million in additional revenues

usa had increased revenues for its linecaresm maintenance program of million 
tesi revenues increased by million  as we connected new customers to our wastewater systems in delaware 
all other operations contributed million of additional revenues 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million or as compared to the same period in continued growth of our delaware water and wastewater operations led to higher costs of million 
despite lower water production volume of for our middlesex system  costs increased by million due to increased unit costs for electricity  chemicals and residuals removal 
costs for providing services under our contract with the city of perth amboy increased by million and costs for providing services under our contracts in delaware increased by million

labor and benefits expenses fell by million due to vacant positions and improved performance on investments 
all other operating costs increased by million 
depreciation expense for increased by million  or  due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
as our investments in utility plant and operating expenses increase  we continue to seek timely rate relief through base rate filings as discussed above 
other taxes increased by million generally reflecting additional taxes on higher taxable gross revenues  payroll and real estate 
other income decreased million  primarily due to higher allowance for funds used during construction afudc as capital spending increased compared to the prior year

net income increased to million from million in the prior year  and basic earnings per share increased from to 
diluted earnings per share increased from to 
outlook in addition to factors previously discussed under results of operations in compared to  our revenues are expected to increase in from anticipated customer growth in delaware for our regulated water operations and  to a lesser degree  from growth in our regulated wastewater operations in delaware 
we also expect revenues to increase as a result of the settlement of our middlesex rate case effective october  the approved increase of is expected to generate million of revenues on an annual basis assuming actual market conditions are consistent with our projections 
revenues and earnings will also be influenced by weather 
changes in these factors  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs are the primary factors that determine the need for rate increase filings 
we continue to explore viable plans to streamline operations and reduce costs in all aspects of our business 
we expect our interest expense to increase during as a result of higher expected average borrowings against the short term credit facilities in order to finance a portion of our capital expenditures during the coming year see liquidity and capital resources 
our strategy includes continued revenue growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  contract operations and when necessary  rate relief 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that are financially sound  complement existing operations and increase shareholder value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on three factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in results of operations 
for  cash flows from operating activities increased million to million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher net income and depreciation 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures for the period internally  with the remainder funded with proceeds from equity issued under our dividend reinvestment plan  long term borrowings and short term borrowings 
for  cash flows from operating activities increased million to million  as compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher net income  depreciation and the timing of collection of customer billings 
these decreases in cash flows were partially offset by receipts of advance service fees and the timing of payments for interest and employee benefit plans 
the million of net cash flow from operations allowed us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures for the period internally  with the remainder funded with proceeds from equity issued under a formal offering in november and our dividend reinvestment plan and both short term and long term borrowings 
increases in certain operating costs will impact our liquidity and capital resources 
as described in our results of operations discussion  during we received rate relief for tidewater and middlesex 
we continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize any regulatory lag between increasing operating and capital costs and appropriate rate relief 
there is no certainty  however  that the bpu or psc will approve any or all future requested increases 
sources of liquidity short term debt 
the company has established lines of credit aggregating million 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
the weighted average daily amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were million and million at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under state revolving fund srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the delaware and new jersey srf loan programs during and expect to participate in the new jersey srf program for up to million 
during  middlesex closed on million of first mortgage bonds through the new jersey environmental infrastructure trust njeit under the new jersey srf loan program in order to finance our renew program 
the proceeds of these bonds and any interest earned are held by a trustee  and are classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
during  tidewater closed on a million loan with the delaware srf 
the proceeds will be used to fund two specific projects of the capital program in delaware 
substantially all of the utility plant of the company is subject to the lien of its mortgage  which also includes debt service and capital ratio covenants  certain restrictions as to cash dividend payments and other distributions on common stock 
the company is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions 
common stock 
the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan the plan 
the company raised million through the issuance of shares under the plan during periodically  the company may issue additional equity to reduce short term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
the last public offering of its common stock closed in november the majority of the net proceeds of approximately million from that common stock offering of  shares were used to repay all of the company s short term borrowings outstanding at that time 
capital expenditures and commitments under our capital program for  we plan to expend million for additions and improvements for our delaware water systems  which include the construction of several storage tanks and the creation of new wells and interconnections 
we expect to spend approximately million for construction of wastewater systems in delaware 
we expect to spend million as we begin to implement a company wide information system upgrade 
we expect to spend million for our renew program  which is our program to clean and cement line unlined mains in the middlesex system 
there remains a total of approximately miles of unlined mains in the mile middlesex system 
in  eight miles of unlined mains were cleaned and cement lined 
the capital program also includes million for scheduled upgrades to our existing systems in new jersey 
the scheduled upgrades consist of million for improvements to existing plant  million for mains  million for service lines  million for meters  million for hydrants  and million for other infrastructure needs 
to pay for our capital program in  we will utilize internally generated funds and funds available and held in trust under existing njeit loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million 
the srf programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and system improvement benchmarks 
if necessary  we will also utilize short term borrowings through million of available lines of credit with several financial institutions 
as of december   we had million outstanding against the lines of credit 
going forward into through  we currently project that we may be required to expend between million and million for capital projects 
the exact amount is dependent on customer growth  residential housing sales and project scheduling 
in particular  middlesex has filed a prudency review application with the bpu for a proposed major transmission pipeline designed to strengthen its existing transmission network and provide system redundancy 
initial estimates to construct the pipeline are million 
the duration and outcome of the bpu review process may affect the construction schedule as well as the project viability 
to the extent possible and because of favorable interest rates available to regulated water utilities  we expect to finance our capital expenditures under the srf loan programs 
we also expect to use internally generated funds and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
it may also be necessary to sell shares of our common stock through a public offering 
contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s other underlying consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  millions of dollars payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations employee retirement plans total amount not determinable after one year 
guarantees usa pa operates the city of perth amboy s perth amboy water and wastewater systems under a service contract agreement through june  the agreement was effected under new jersey s water supply public private contracting act and the new jersey wastewater public private contracting act 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
scheduled fixed fee payments were million in and will increase over the term of the contract to million by the end of the contract 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds 
middlesex guaranteed one of those series of bonds  designated the series c serial bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
the series c serial bonds have various maturity dates with the final maturity date on september  as of december   approximately million of the series c serial bonds remained outstanding 
we are obligated to perform under the guarantee in the event notice is received from the series c serial bonds trustee of an impending debt service deficiency 
if middlesex funds any debt service obligations as guarantor  there is a provision in the agreement that requires perth amboy to reimburse us 
there are other provisions in the agreement that we believe make it unlikely that we will be required to perform under the guarantee  such as scheduled annual rate increases for the water and wastewater services as well as rate increases due to unforeseen circumstances 
in the event revenues from customers could not satisfy the reimbursement requirements  perth amboy has ad valorem taxing powers  which could be used to raise the needed amount 
critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
changes in these variables may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance provided in the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in accordance with sfas no 
 costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded would be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not significant  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
pension plan we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees with more than  hours of service and who were hired prior to march  the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations has increased from at december  to at december  and increased to at december  lowering the discount rate by would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million in lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans by from to would have increased the net periodic pension cost in by approximately million 
the discount rate for determining future pension obligations is determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds at our december measurement date 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the pension plan 
recent accounting standards see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
