item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of surgical and non surgical products for the spine  orthopedics  sports medicine and vascular market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are invasive and minimally invasive spinal implant products and related human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  non invasive bone growth stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  other pain management products  bone cement and devices for removal of bone cement used to fix artificial implants and airway management products used in anesthesia applications 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy and mexico 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico  brazil  and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
however  sales associated with products for elective procedures appear to be influenced by the somewhat lower level of such procedures performed in the late summer 
certain of the breg bracing products experience greater demand in the fall and winter corresponding with high school and college football schedules and winter sports 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on september   we completed the acquisition of blackstone medical  inc blackstone  a privately held company specializing in the design  development and marketing of spinal implant and related hct p products 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million  subject to certain closing adjustments  plus transaction costs totaling approximately million as of december  the acquisition and related costs were financed with million of senior secured bank debt and cash on hand 
financing costs were approximately million 

table of contents effective with the acquisition of blackstone  we manage our operations as four business segments domestic  blackstone  breg  and international 
domestic consists of operations of our subsidiary orthofix  inc blackstone consists of blackstone s domestic and international operations 
breg consists of breg s domestic operations and international distributors 
international consists of operations which are located in the rest of the world excluding blackstone s international operations as well as independent export distribution operations 
group activities are comprised of the operating expenses and identifiable assets of orthofix international nv and its nv holding company  orthofix holdings  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and certain bracing products that are prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for domestic spinal implant and hct p products  we recognize revenue when the product has been utilized and we have received a confirming purchase order from the hospital 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify that title passes only on delivery 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory write down in the future may be necessary 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 require that goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  such as trademarks  cease to be amortized 
sfas no 
requires that we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment 
if we find that the carrying value of goodwill or a certain intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset to the fair value  and we will recognize an impairment loss 
any such impairment losses will be recorded as non cash operating losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets with definite lives should be tested for impairment if a triggering event  as defined in the standard  occurs 
upon a triggering event  we are to compare the cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the intangible asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flow 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve substantial amounts of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and client base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
as part of the total blackstone purchase price  million was placed into an escrow account  against which we can make claims for reimbursement for certain defined items relating to the acquisition for which we are indemnified 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has certain contingencies arising from the acquisition that we expect will be reimbursable from the escrow account should we have to make a payment to a third party 
we believe that the amount that we will be required to pay relating to the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account  however  there can be no assurance that the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  as such  we determine whether it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of each position 
at december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties of million 
share based compensation prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january   we accounted for our stock option and award plans and stock purchase plan using the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related interpretations  and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and its related interpretation 
as of january   we began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods 
under the modified prospective transition method  share based compensation expense for and includes a compensation cost for all share based awards granted on or after january  as determined based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and b share based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
we recognize these compensation costs ratably over the vesting period  which is generally three years 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  our pre tax income for the years ended december  and has been reduced by share based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of each share based award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model for option pricing 
the model relies upon management assumptions for expected volatility rates based on the historical volatility using daily pricing of our common stock and the expected term of options granted  which is estimated based on a number of factors including the vesting term of the award  historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired  the expected volatility of our common stock and an employee s average length of service 
the risk free interest rate used in the model is determined based upon a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we reduce the calculated black scholes value by applying a forfeiture rate  based upon historical pre vesting option cancellations
