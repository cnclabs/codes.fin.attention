results of operations overview over the last several years  the price appreciation of homes was relatively high in most markets and  in turn  attracted speculation 
beginning in  as appreciation slowed  declining consumer confidence and demand caused national homebuilders to experience increasing inventories  which resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of homes available for sale and a softening of demand for new homes 
during the latter half of  a significant decrease in the availability of mortgage products resulting from increased industry loan delinquencies and foreclosure rates  and the related tightening of credit standards  further impacted the industry and the company s ability to attract qualified homebuyers 
these factors have exacerbated already high inventory levels of new and resale homes  increased cancellation levels and weakened consumer confidence 
as a result  during  the company continued to report declines in the volume of homes sold  decreases in prices  high sales contract cancellation rates and additional valuation adjustments 
in an effort to compensate for these developments  it has amended its operating strategy to focus on cash generation and moderation of risk through increased sales price discounts and other incentives  opportunistic land sales  reductions in excess inventory and commitments to purchase land in the future through contract renegotiations and cancellations  controlled development spending  renegotiations of contracts with subcontractors and suppliers  and reductions in overhead expense to more closely match projected volume levels

risk factors 
due to the company s increased use of price reductions and sales incentives  the company s evaluation of its inventory through quarterly impairment analyses during resulted in million of inventory valuation adjustments 
charges of million related to the abandonment of land purchase option contracts reflect the deterioration of specific related returns and the assumption that recent price reductions are indicative of price levels for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
these assets were largely the result of inventory impairments taken during the year and reflect uncertainty with regard to the duration of current conditions in housing markets 
should the company generate significant taxable income in future years  it will reverse the allowance in the form of a lower effective income tax rate 
additionally  the company evaluated the recoverability of its goodwill 
goodwill decreased from million at december   to million at december   due to a million impairment charge in the first quarter of  and is now among the lowest in the industry 
for the year ended december   the company reported a consolidated net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share  for and million  or per diluted share  for excluding these impairments and charges  the company s earnings for would have been million  or per share 
the decrease in earnings for  compared to  was due to a decline in revenues and lower margins  the latter resulting from inventory valuation adjustments and other write offs  as well as from a more competitive sales environment in most markets 
the decline in earnings for  compared to  resulted from a broad trend toward softening demand in residential housing and a more competitive sales environment in most markets  as well as from inventory valuation adjustments and write offs of deposits and preacquisition costs that accompanied selective local market weakness 
total revenues were billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a decline in closings  average closing price and mortgage originations 
total revenues for decreased from levels by million  or percent  primarily due to a decline in closing volume  partially offset by an increase in average sales price 
homebuilding pretax operating margins were negative percent for  compared to percent for and percent for the decreases in margins were primarily due to increased price concessions and sales incentives in most markets  as well as to inventory and goodwill valuation adjustments and write offs 
excluding noncash impairments  adjusted ebitda was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the company s ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest incurred was for the year ended december   compared to for and for in an effort to position itself for competitive industry conditions in  the company generated cash flow from its operations  in part  by reducing land acquisitions  development activity and its obligations to take down land in the future 
at december   it had  fewer lots under control  or a percent decrease from year end the company s balance sheet continues to reflect its low risk strategy and transparency 
the company ended the year with million in cash and no borrowings against its revolving credit facility

the company s net debt to capital ratio was percent at december   compared to percent for the same period in as a result of the revaluation of a significant portion of inventory and deferred tax assets  and balancing cash flow with inventory management and leverage objectives  stockholders equity per share declined by percent to in  compared to in the company s book value at december   was percent tangible 
homebuilding overview the combined homebuilding operations reported pretax losses of million for  compared to earnings of million for and million for homebuilding results in decreased from primarily due to a decline in closings and margins and to the impact of inventory valuation adjustments and write offs

the dollar value of new orders decreased million  or percent  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   primarily due to slowing demand 
the dollar value of new orders declined by percent to billion in from billion for the same period in  primarily due to slowing demand and increases in cancellation rates 
this decrease in new orders was primarily attributable to a softening of demand in most markets and a more competitive sales environment 
additionally  market uncertainty and heightened pricing competition among homebuilders led to rising cancellation rates by homebuyers and were a major factor in these declines 
cancellation rates totaled percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
unit orders decreased percent in and percent in homebuilding revenues fell percent for  compared to  due to a percent decrease in closings and a percent decrease in average closing price 
the decline in closings in was due to slowing market trends  changes in the availability of financing for its customers and a more competitive sales environment in most markets 
homebuilding revenues fell percent for  compared to  due to a percent decrease in closings  partially offset by a percent increase in average closing price 
the decline in closings in was due to slowing market trends and a more competitive sales environment in most markets 
the increase in average closing price was primarily due to the delivery of homes in that were sold in under more favorable market conditions 
consistent with its policy of managing land investments according to return and risk targets  the company executed several land and lot sales during the year

price concessions and sales incentives  as a percentage of revenues  totaled percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effect of price declines  valuation adjustments and write offs was partially offset by the amortization of valuation allowances based on home closings  which impacted gross margins by percent and percent  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  inventory is reviewed for potential write downs on an ongoing basis 
sfas requires that  in the event that impairment indicators are present  impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
undiscounted cash flow projections are generated at a community level based on estimates of revenues  costs and other factors 
the company s analysis of these communities generally assumes flat revenues when compared with current sales orders for particular or comparable communities 
the company s determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with inherent risks that are associated with assets and related estimated cash flow streams 
valuation adjustments are recorded against homes completed or under construction  land under development and improved lots when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values 
due to continued pressure on home prices symptomatic of excess home inventories in many markets combined with the industry s recent predisposition toward a reduction in land option pipelines  the company recorded inventory impairment charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  in order to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value 
approximately percent of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately percent of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory 
at december   the fair value of the company s inventory subject to valuation adjustments during the year  net of million of impairments  was million 
there were communities with write downs in  compared to communities in the inventory impairment charges and write offs of deposits and acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  by percent in and percent in should market conditions deteriorate or costs increase  it is possible that the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flows from its communities may decline  resulting in additional future inventory impairment charges 
the company periodically writes off earnest money deposits and feasibility costs related to land and lot option contracts that it no longer plans to pursue 
during the year ended december   the company wrote off million and million of earnest money deposits and feasibility costs  respectively  that related to land purchase option contracts which it would not pursue 
for the same period in  write offs of earnest money deposits and feasibility costs related to land purchase option contracts that the company would not pursue were million and million  respectively 
should currently weak homebuilding market conditions persist or deteriorate and the company be unsuccessful in its efforts to renegotiate certain land purchase contracts  it may write off additional earnest money deposits and feasibility costs in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  were percent for  percent for and percent for the percentage increase for  compared to  was mainly attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of million  an million charge relating to severance and relocation costs  charges of million for feasibility cost write offs  and higher marketing and advertising costs per unit  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expense dollars decreased million for the year ended december   versus the same period in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  remained relatively flat in  compared to  due to cost reduction efforts made in the face of declining revenues in various markets and a decrease in compensation that was commensurate with lower earnings  partially offset by million in feasibility cost write offs that resulted from the abandonment of certain projects 
interest is incurred principally to finance land acquisitions  land development and home construction  and totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively

homebuilding segment information the company s homebuilding operations consist of four geographically determined regional reporting segments north  southeast  texas and west 
conditions have been increasingly challenging in geographical areas that have previously experienced the highest price appreciation  such as the california  florida  las vegas  phoenix and washington dc  markets 
as a result of declining affordability  decreased demand and changes in buyer perception  the excess supply of housing inventory has reached higher levels in these areas 
in an attempt to maintain market share and reduce inventory investment to match current sales volume levels  the company has increased its use of sales discounting and incentives 
as a result  it has taken significant additional impairments in the north  southeast and west regions 
to date  the discounting has been most pronounced in the company s west region due to dramatic price declines resulting from these markets experiencing more difficult conditions with regard to affordability and mortgage financing availability

historically  new order activity is higher in the spring and summer months 
as a result  it typically has more homes under construction  closes more homes  and has greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year 
this is primarily due to the preference of many homebuyers to act during those periods

critical accounting policies preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
listed below are those policies that management believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
there are items within the financial statements that require estimation  but are not considered critical 
use of estimates in budgeting land acquisitions  development and homebuilding construction costs associated with real estate projects  the company evaluates market conditions  material and labor costs  buyer preferences  construction timing  and provisions for insurance and warranty obligations 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for resolution of legal claims 
estimates  which are based on historical experience and other assumptions  are reviewed continually  updated when necessary and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the timing and scope of its evaluation procedures are proper and adequate 
changes in assumptions relating to such factors  however  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period 
income recognition revenues and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home or lot is closed  title and possession are transferred to the buyer and there is no significant continuing involvement in accordance with sfas in order to match revenues with related expenses  land  land development  interest  taxes and other related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are allocated to the cost of homes closed  based upon the relative sales value basis of the total number of homes to be constructed in each community  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
estimated land  common area development and related costs of planned communities  including the cost of amenities  are allocated to individual parcels or communities on a relative sales value basis 
changes to estimated costs  subsequent to the commencement of the delivery of homes  are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
inventory valuation housing projects and land held for development inventory and sale are stated at either the lower of cost or net realizable value 
inventory includes land and development costs  direct construction costs  capitalized indirect construction costs  capitalized interest  and real estate taxes 
it may take one to three years to develop  sell and deliver all of the homes in a typical community 
the company assesses these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas requires that long lived assets and assets held for sale be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of housing inventories is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or by the sales of comparable assets 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less selling costs 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses  as well as by other factors 
in addition  land  or costs related to future communities  whether owned or under option  are reviewed to determine if the company will proceed with development and if all related costs are recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and is recognized within the same period that it is identified 
management believes its processes are designed to properly assess the market and carrying values of assets 
warranty reserves the company s homes are sold with limited third party warranties 
warranty reserves are established as homes close on a house by house basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods 
certain factors are considered in determining the reserves  including the historical range of amounts paid per house  experience with respect to similar home designs and geographical areas  the historical amount paid as a percentage of home construction costs  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  and conditions that may affect certain subdivisions 
improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures are also considered 
accordingly  the process of determining the company s warranty reserves balance necessarily requires estimates associated with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact the warranty reserves balance 
generally  warranty reserves are reviewed monthly to determine the reasonableness and adequacy of both the aggregate reserve and the per unit reserve amount originally included in home cost of sales  as well as the timing of any reversals of the original reserve 
general warranty reserves not utilized for a particular house are evaluated for reasonableness in the aggregate on both a market by market and consolidated basis 
warranty payments for an individual house may exceed the related reserve 
payments in excess of the reserve are evaluated in the aggregate to determine if an adjustment to the warranty reserve should be recorded  which could result in a corresponding adjustment to home cost of sales 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its warranty reserves and believes that its existing estimation process is materially accurate 
because the company s warranty reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that changes to the company s assumptions could have a material impact on its warranty reserve balances 
variable interest entities vie fin requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities and or entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns 
fin also requires disclosure about vies that the company is not obligated to consolidate but in which it has a significant  though not primary  variable interest 
the company enters into joint ventures  from time to time  for the purpose of acquisition and co development of land parcels and lots 
its investment in these joint ventures may create a variable interest in a vie  depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land for the construction of homes 
under such lot option purchase contracts  the company funds stated deposits in consideration for the right to purchase lots at a future point in time  usually at predetermined prices 
in accordance with the requirements of fin  certain of the company s lot option purchase contracts may result in the creation of a variable interest in a vie 
the company believes the accounting for joint ventures and land option purchase contracts using the variable interest consolidation methodology is a critical accounting policy because compliance with fin requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
income taxes the company calculates a provision for its income taxes by using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
in accordance with sfas  the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established based on its determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
judgment is required in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements and or tax returns 
differences between the amounts recognized in its financial statements or tax returns and actual outcomes may arise upon issuance of regulations and final guidance from federal and state taxing authorities and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
share based payments effective january   the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires that compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the company calculates the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to forfeit 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
outlook in  the company continued to experience a decline in sales orders for new homes  compared to the same period last year 
the company believes its sales orders reflect broader market trends that reflect soft demand for residential housing 
nearly all markets have been affected by reductions in the affordability of homes  the availability of mortgage products and the consumer demand for homes  leading to the continued buildup of new and resale home inventories 
at december   the company s backlog of orders for new homes totaled  units  or a projected value of million  reflecting a percent decline in dollar value from december  as long as the imbalance of housing supply and demand continues  the company will remain focused on its liquidity and balance sheet  while seeking to optimize its earnings and to position itself for a return to a more favorable economic environment
