overview axcelis technologies  inc axcelis  we  us  or our  is a worldwide producer of equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services 
we own of the equity of a joint venture known as sen corporation  an shi and axcelis company  or sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
sen licenses technology from us relating to the manufacture of specified ion implantation products and has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products in the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenues and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  could fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
the industry experienced a downturn in  which is expected to continue at least through the first half of our gross margins are also affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we could experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenues as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase competitive pricing as higher percentages of our total revenues are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
beginning in  most customers shifted from multi wafer tools to single wafer tools for high current ion implant applications 
because we did not have a single wafer high current product  we have experienced a significant loss of market share which we have yet to regain 
we introduced our single wafer optima hd for high current applications product in and have begun to gain traction with this tool at a number of customers through evaluation arrangements 
as of december   no revenue has been recognized on the optima hd 
our single wafer tool for high energy ion implant applications  the optima xe  was released in the fourth quarter of we expect the optima xe to allow us to maintain a leading market share in high energy applications moving forward 
as of december   total amounts capitalized as part of inventory  evaluation tools classified as a component of inventory on the balance sheet and other assets related to our investment in the optima product line were approximately million 
as optima tools shipped in convert into revenue in  we expect a significant reduction in these amounts 
axcelis accesses the important japanese market for certain ion implant systems through a joint venture known as sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
that we do not control 
the joint venture agreement gives both owners veto rights  so that neither owner alone can effectively control sen 
sen s business is subject to the same risks as our business 
royalties and equity income from sen have made a substantial contribution to our earnings  and a substantial decline in sen s sales and net income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
as a result of this joint venture structure  we have less control over sen management than over our own management and may not have timely knowledge of factors affecting sen s business 
in addition  given the equal ownership  it is possible that the sen board may be unable to reach consensus on important matters from time to time which could delay important decisions or create a deadlock  which could lead to the liquidation of sen

operating results for the years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future interim periods or years as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of products under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value  in accordance with the provisions of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to product revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
we generally recognize systems revenue at the time of shipment because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that new systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers of mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
for initial shipments of systems with new technologies or in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to service hours is recognized when the services are performed 
royalty revenue is primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
royalty revenue is recorded at the time sen notifies the company that royalties have been earned 
beginning with the period ended september   we modified the classification of various components of revenue presented in the statement of operations to more closely align with sec reporting guidelines 
product revenue includes revenue from system sales  sales of spare parts  the spare parts component of maintenance and service contracts and product upgrades 
service revenue includes the labor component of maintenance and service contract amounts charged for on site service personnel 
revenue and cost of revenue amounts presented for prior periods have been reclassified to permit comparison 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and are generally amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
impairment reviews may be performed more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the reporting unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
in september  we elected to discontinue future development of the rtp and photostabilization curing product lines 
based on that business decision  the forecast of future cash flows was revised and  as such  in september a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
in addition  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for our other reporting units 
as a result of this review  we determined that there were no additional impairments of our goodwill as of december  we assess the impairment of intangible and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and a significant decrease in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
as a result of this review  we determined there were no impairments of our intangible and long lived assets as of december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty axcelis offers a one to three year product warranty  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue product services royalties  primarily from sen cost of revenue product services gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges income loss from operations other income expense equity income of sen interest income interest expense other net income loss before income taxes income taxes credits net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in product revenue in and has been reduced by our loss of high current market share  as discussed above 
the decline in product revenue in is also attributable to a weakening semiconductor market and a related decrease in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition a decrease in capacity expansion at mm manufacturing facilities a portion of which relates to the overall decline in the semiconductor capital equipment market decreased revenue from system sales by million for approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
market trends for the past several years highlight the growth in sales toward mm products and the decrease in expansion of facilities using mm products 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
royalties royalty revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
changes are mainly attributable to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
ion implant revenue from sales of ion implantation products and service accounted for million  or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in annual revenues from the sale of ion implantation products and service typically average from to of total revenues 
aftermarket aftermarket revenues  which include sales of spare parts  product upgrades and service revenues  were million for  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for  compared to for the decrease in gross profit from product revenues is attributable to a decline in product revenue and the related under absorption of manufacturing overheads approximately and lower margins on new product revenue approximately  offset by the favorable impact of a higher mix of upgrades and proprietary spare parts approximately 
service gross profit from service revenue was for  compared to for the increase in gross profit for is attributable to improved utilization of the fixed service labor cost base 
research and development research and development expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  compared with million in the decrease was driven primarily by decreased variable compensation costs million  decreased professional fee expenses million and decreased payroll costs million  offset by increased project material costs million and increased development asset amortization and depreciation costs million 
research and development expense was attributable to the following activities for for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing selling expense was million in  an increase of million  or  compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by increased payroll costs million  increased costs related to evaluation system support for our optima platform million and increased stock compensation costs million  offset by lower commissions expense million

impairment of goodwill during the three month period ended september   we elected to discontinue future development of the rtp and curing product lines 
based on that business decision  the forecast of future cash flows was revised and  as such  in september a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded 
the fair value of these product lines was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows

see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
restructuring in october of  we implemented a reduction in force related to planned actions taken by management to control costs and improve the focus of its operations in order to sustain future profitability and conserve cash 
this reduction in force is expected to result in a total charge to expense of approximately million related to separation and outplacement costs  of which million was recorded in the statement of operations at december  the remaining million will be recorded in the first quarter of a total of million has been paid through december  substantially all payments related to these actions will be completed in the first quarter of changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance retention leases total in thousands balance at december    restructuring expense   cash payments    balance at december  the lease restructuring liability relates to the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts during these leases were paid over the remaining lease term  which ended december  other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million for this is compared to equity income attributable to sen of million for fluctuations in equity income from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million for  primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased by million from  due primarily to lower average cash balances  resulting from the repayment of million of long term debt in january interest expense of million in  a decrease of million from  relates primarily to the outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes which have an effective yield to maturity of 
the decrease in interest expense in is a direct result of the repayment of million of long term debt in january income taxes credits income tax credits for were million 
in  we determined that certain tax reserves relating to a previous tax year were no longer required 
as a result  we recorded an adjustment to reduce income tax expense by million 
in addition  during the year we recorded tax benefits related to the realization of foreign tax credits  which we expect to recover approximately million in tax refunds of amounts paid for alternative minimum taxes remitted for tax years through we incur income tax expense relating principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  we do not currently pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions and we do not recognize the tax benefit for such losses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue product product revenue  which includes systems sales  sales of spare parts and product upgrades  was million or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue in system sales increased to million in from million in the increase in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to stronger market demand resulting from higher levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
while overall systems revenue increased in  the shift by semiconductor manufacturers from our multi wafer high current ion implant systems to single wafer high current ion implant systems had an adverse  though not quantifiable  impact on systems revenue 
the high current segment constitutes approximately fifty percent of the worldwide ion implant market 
our first shipment of our new single wafer high dose ion implant system occurred in we began shipping our new mid dose single wafer ion implant system in  and recognized revenue on multiple shipments during the year 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
market trends for the past several years highlight the growth in sales toward mm products and the decrease in expansion of facilities using mm products 
a portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed 
the total amount of deferred revenue at december  and was million and million  respectively 
service service revenue  which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on site service personnel  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue  for although service revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems  it can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities  which affects the need for equipment service 
royalties royalty revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
changes are mainly attributed to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan 
ion implant revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in ion implantation continues to be our largest product category 
aftermarket aftermarket revenues which include sales of spare parts  product upgrades and service revenues were million for  compared to million for aftermarket revenue generally increases with expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service 
gross profit product gross profit from product revenue was for  compared to for the gross profit performance compared to was the result of favorable operating overheads approximately  systems volume  product mix and changes in revenue deferrals approximately  offset by the negative impact of proportionately lower spare parts upgrades volume approximately 
service gross profit from service revenue was for  compared to for the decrease in gross profit for is attributable to decreased service revenue over a relatively fixed service labor cost base approximately  combined with a higher mix of lower margin labor based service revenue approximately 
research and development research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by expenses associated with an increase of project driven headcount million  variable compensation payouts million and stock option expense million 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with project material million  development asset amortization and depreciation million and in process research and development expense in related to the diamond semiconductor group acquisition million 
increases in overall research and development expenses in compared with are attributable principally to development efforts related to our single wafer optima platform 
research and development expense involved the following activities in for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in this increase was driven primarily by higher commission million and variable compensation million expenses 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower payroll million and amortization and depreciation million expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in this increase was driven primarily by higher costs associated with variable compensation million and stock compensation million offset by reduced costs associated with the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts million and lower lease  travel  utilities  sales tax and insurance expense million 
stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
the effect of adopting sfas r was to reduce net income for the year ended december  by million on basic and diluted earnings per share 
total stock based compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december  was million 
stock based compensation expense recognized for restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended december  was million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
restructuring for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million  primarily related to a reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms and expected lease termination costs associated with exiting a portion of the facilities  are based on management s evaluation of the commercial rental market 
the above mentioned charges are net of a credit of million to previously recognized restructuring charges relating primarily to the adjustment for severance and other one time termination benefits associated with reduction in force actions and the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
in addition to the amounts reported as restructuring charges  million of relocation and other incremental expenses related to the consolidation of the rockville  maryland operations are included in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity has not been significant  as management estimates these actions have yielded equivalent cash savings 
changes in our restructuring liability  included in amounts reported as other current liabilities  are as follows severance retention leases total in thousands balance at december    restructuring expense credit  cash payments   balance at december    other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased by million from due primarily to higher interest rates earned on invested balances and an increase in average cash balances compared to  most of which came from the issuance of an additional million of convertible senior subordinated notes on may  interest expense of million in and million in primarily relates to our long term debt issued in january the increase of million relates primarily to our issuance of an additional million of convertible senior subordinated notes on may  which contain an effective yield to maturity of approximately 
income taxes credits income tax expense for was million 
income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating losses in the united states and certain foreign tax jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  do not pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions nor have the ability to obtain tax benefit for such losses 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is mainly attributable to the repayment of million for our convertible subordinated notes  cash used by operations million  capital expenditures million and an increase of restricted cash balances million 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on may   we entered into an exchange and purchase agreement pursuant to which the holder of an aggregate of approximately million of our existing convertible subordinated notes due january  the old notes  agreed to exchange its old notes for million in aggregate principal amount of our newly issued convertible senior subordinated notes due january  the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the old notes through but excluding may   the closing date of the exchange 
in addition  we issued an additional million of new notes  resulting in an aggregate of million of new notes outstanding 
we repaid the remaining million of outstanding old notes in january at maturity  we will be required to repay the outstanding principal of the new notes  plus a maturity premium of of such principal  a total of million  resulting in an effective annual yield to maturity of approximately 
at march   the new notes will be reclassified to current liabilities 
during  we experienced negative cash flows from operations and anticipate significant cash outflows in the first quarter of cash used for operations in was predominately driven by operating needs to support the optima product line approximately million 
we expect to generate cash from operations during our cash position will be driven by reductions in working capital  as inventory for the optima product line is converted into revenue 
we expect that existing resources will be sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements in however  we intend to enter into new credit facilities during which will provide resources to repay the new notes in january these financing alternatives under consideration include a revolving credit facility and or a sale lease back of our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
any proceeds from financing events will be used to repay the new notes when they mature on january  we expect to have new financing in place by the end of the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that these financing transactions will be completed 
in addition  interest rates on new debt may be higher than rates currently in effect on our outstanding new notes 
if we are unable to refinance or obtain additional financing when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of business development activities  which could harm the long term growth of the business 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe 
at december   million of cash was pledged as collateral for certain outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt including interest    purchase order commitments   operating leases    amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit   guarantees    axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business  including acceptance of the optima product line  and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  anticipated financing events mentioned previously and expected positive cash flows for will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements through recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

outlook our performance is directly related to semiconductor manufacturers levels of capital expenditures to open new fabrication facilities and expand existing ones  customers acceptance of our new products and operational improvements we have implemented over the past several years
