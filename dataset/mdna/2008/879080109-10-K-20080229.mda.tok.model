five west parcel llc is a joint venture with rockefeller development group to construct and lease or sell a  square foot industrial building that was completed during february tejon dermody llc sold its primary asset during and is in the process of winding up its operations 
in addition  the company leases several microwave repeater locations  radio and cellular transmitter sites  and fiber optic cable routes  acres of land to calpine generating company  or calpine  for an electric power plant  and one office building in rancho santa fe  california which the company also owns 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production  based upon prevailing average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities 
we have two major resort residential projects within this segment that are progressing through the entitlement process 
the entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete 
centennial development the centennial development is a large master planned community development encompassing  acres of our land within los angeles county 
upon completion of centennial  it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when complete  would create a substantial number of jobs 
centennial is being developed by centennial founders  llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partners in this joint venture are 
table of contents pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
during our partners met the  sole entitlement funding commitment required in the joint venture agreement  and we are now contributing of the continuing capital needs of this joint venture 
since the initial submittal of our administrative level environmental impact report  or administrative eir  to los angeles county in  we have continued to receive feedback from the los angeles planning department and have submitted several revisions of our administrative eir as we work towards the public filing of our eir and final approval 
we cannot estimate when this approval will be granted  but the process is being actively pursued 
in addition to the eir  we have submitted a variety of other reports required as part of the entitlement process including our specific plan  tentative tract maps  geological reports  traffic reports  and water supply assessment reports 
centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development 
our plan is for a sustainable program that provides for the needs of the community while protecting the environment and will be achieved through our continuing focus on responsible use of limited resources and progressive construction design 
we recognize the need to balance expensive green program certifications with the practicality of investing those same funds in environmentally sound building elements 
tejon mountain village development in addition to the centennial community project  we are currently engaged in the development of tmv 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
tmv is being developed by tmv llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partner in this joint venture is dmb tmv llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dmb associates inc  or dmb  which is a leading resort recreational planned community developer 
under the joint venture agreement  the parties have agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in  the company contributed rights to all studies  research  and other work that we had performed related to tmv to the joint venture and committed to contribute  acres comprising the tmv site at such time as entitlements are successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb committed up to a total of  to fund entitlement efforts and development 
dmb s contribution requirement calls for sole funding of entitlement efforts up to  after which remaining entitlement funding is shared equally between the partners 
we anticipate this  level of investment will be reached during at the commencement of the development phase of the project  dmb will fund the first  of development cost  after which additional funding is shared equally between the partners 
numerous reports and studies were completed in in preparation for the potential submission in of our eir to the kern county planning department 
in addition to the eir itself  technical reports addressing air quality  geology  hydrology  noise  transportation and traffic  recreation and education  and paleontology have been completed or are in the process of being completed and reviewed 
additionally  other requisite work is being performed as mandated by the joint venture agreement 

table of contents because our residential housing projects  centennial and tmv  are in the entitlement phase  they have not been impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the credit crisis 
however  we cannot project the condition of the housing market or the stability of the mortgage industry at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition is impacted by such factors as the supply of comparable real estate available for sale or lease and the level of demand for that real estate 
currently  our greatest competition for commercial industrial development comes from land in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial project will come from developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  pistachios and walnuts we grow wheat on approximately acres and alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley and we periodically lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
in  we sold of our grape crop to one winery and the remainder to two other customers 
these sales are under long term contracts ranging from three to ten years 
our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with one of the buyers accounting for of our almond revenues and two others accounting for approximately each 
the majority of our pistachios were sold to two customers  with the larger customer purchasing approximately of the crop 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities  the large number of buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract 
our walnut crop was our final harvest of walnuts  and we are removing this orchard to plant winegrapes for which we have a long term contract 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
our water entitlement for available from the state water project was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources has announced its water supply at of full entitlement 
this allocation alone is insufficient for our farming needs  however  combined with other water supplies that local water districts may be able to make 
table of contents available to its farmers  groundwater sources  water transfers from tejon castac water district  and water banking arrangements  we expect to have a level of water supply that will meet all of our farming requirements 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but is expected to make up for the water shortfalls that we may experience during the coming year

table of contents item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial supply of similar product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
several years ago  the los angeles county planning department released a set of draft amendments to the los angeles county general plan that would extend a planning overlay designation called sensitive ecological areas to cover most of the footprint of the centennial project 
it is not clear what chance this draft has of being adopted by the los angeles county board of supervisors or what its impact on centennial would be  but if adopted it would likely involve additional processing time  studies  and findings by county officials  which could have an adverse impact similar to the density provisions described above  and affect the character and intensity of uses permitted in the centennial project area 
in addition  many states  cities and 
table of contents counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  presumed removal of oak trees  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
recent concerns over the impact of development on global warming increases the breadth of potential obstacles that our developments face 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  tic west and east  centennial and tmv  involve obtaining governmental permits or entitlements 
a delay in obtaining governmental approvals could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
centennial ultimately would compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 

table of contents our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california 
any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our region of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the real estate and land development industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
only a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of february   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation  since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 
if the downturn in the housing market or the sub prime lending crisis continues  it could have an adverse effect on our real estate business 
our residential housing projects  centennial 
table of contents and tmv  are currently in the entitlement phase  and therefore they have not been impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the sub prime lending crisis 
however  if the downturn in the housing market or the instability of the mortgage industry continues at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases  our resort residential business could be adversely affected 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  fire  heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for the centennial master planned community on  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain and much of the land is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
any significant development of the land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species and 
table of contents wetlands issues  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays in getting governmental approval 
rural agricultural development of much of our mountain land could be accomplished without many or any such approvals  constraints  and or investments  but we have not to date pursued this avenue of development 
water rights existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge water district  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the california state water project to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional entitlement to obtain from the california state water project sufficient water to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tejon castac  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in the tejon industrial complex  has  acre feet of state water project entitlement 
in addition  tejon castac has approximately  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal water supplier to the tejon industrial complex  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
we have constructed a acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern kern county 
water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers 
we subsequently purchased  acre feet of water from the antelope valley east kern water agency  which has been pumped from the california aqueduct and is currently retained in this water bank 
we anticipate adding additional water to this storage facility in this water is available for our current and future use 
during  project allocations were  and the wheeler ridge water district was able to supply us with of our farming demands 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the higher priced state water project water 
both the wheeler ridge water district and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
the wheeler ridge water district expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the state water project deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if state water project deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if less severe shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then the wheeler ridge water district may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfers from tejon castac and water banking assets to supply the shortfalls to our farming operations 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
also  as we develop our real estate for residential  commercial and industrial uses  there will be less water available for agriculture from tejon castac 
a allocation has been made by the state water project for with this allocation  along with the 
table of contents wheeler ridge water district s additional supplies  we believe that we will have adequate water supplies for farming in the water contracts with the wheeler ridge water district and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
the wheeler ridge water district contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
although no assurance has been given  the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  the antelope valley east kern water agency  has indicated  based on water availability  that it could provide a portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater 
that source would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the interstate corridor and provide a portion of the water needed for development at centennial and tmv 
ground water in the antelope valley basin has recently become the subject of litigation 
please refer to item  legal proceedings 
during  there were many environmental challenges regarding the moving of state project water through the sacramento delta 
these challenges resulted in a court ordered shut down of the delta pumps  which are of primary importance to the california water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from northern california to southern california 
after a temporary contingency pumping plan was approved by the court  which protects a certain species of fish  the court allowed the pumps to be turned back on but continued to limit usage 
the usage is limited to approximately capacity until all studies are completed as to the environmental impact to the delta 
this curtailment of water from the delta impacts the delivery of our state water entitlements and during could limit us to only of our total supply 
there are many groups  governmental and private  working together to come up with a solution over the next year to alleviate the curtailment of water from the delta 
historic state water project restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
in the near term  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge water district agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority community facilities district  or cfd  a joint powers authority formed by kern county and the tejon castac water district  has placed liens on  acres of the company s land 
these liens are to secure payment of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by the cfd 
the company is obligated  as a landowner in the district  to pay its share of the special taxes assessed each year 
the  acres of land includes the tic west 
proceeds from the sale of cfd bonds went to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to the tic west 
in   was reimbursed to the company through these bond funds 
in   and  the company paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfd 
as development continues to occur at tejon industrial complex  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through 
table of contents triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  the company s obligation is reduced 
it is expected that the company will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within the cfd and the amount of taxes paid by others 
as development and values increase around the tejon industrial complex  the company may be able to have approximately  acres released from the cfd lien 
item legal proceedings the company leases land to national cement company of california inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits on the leased acreage

an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have substantially completed the groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
to date  the company is not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
under current and prior leases  national and lafarge are obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of their use of the leased premises 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations and that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 

table of contents on november   a complaint was filed asking for the antelope valley ground water basin to be adjudicated 
this means that the rights of all parties overlying the basin  including the company s land  should be fixed based on various principles of water law and on negotiations among the principal parties or groups of water users 
because the case is still in the early stages and not yet at issue  it is too early to ascertain what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company s remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to ground water underlying the company s lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the centennial project s needs will continue to be available for its use

we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in three business segments commercial industrial real estate development and services  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
commercial industrial real estate development and services generates revenues from lease activities  land sales  building sales and leases  oil and mineral royalties and grazing leases 
the primary commercial industrial development is tejon industrial complex  or tic 
resort residential land development does not currently produce revenues but is actively involved in the land entitlement process 
within our resort residential segment  the two active developments are tejon mountain village and the centennial master planned community 
farming produces revenues from the sale of grapes  almonds  pistachios  and walnuts 
for we have net income of  compared to a net loss of  in the significant improvement in net income is attributable to increased revenues of  from our farming operations  increased commercial revenues of  decreased corporate expenses of  and significantly improved equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of  in revenues from operations grew  to  when compared to expenses from operations declined  in to  compared to the prior year 
the growth in commercial revenues of  resulted from improvements in both base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine and from increased revenues from ancillary land use 
the increase in our farming revenues is primarily due to improved yields on our pistachio crop and walnut crop as compared to the large improvement in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures is the result of the sale of the industrial building owned by our tejon dermody joint venture 
the building was sold in july  resulting in a gain of  before tax  of which we recognized  and which is included as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
this was tejon dermody s primary asset  and the entity is now in the process of being dissolved 
corporate expenses decreased in primarily due to the absence of 
table of contents compensation costs that were incurred in relating to the successful formation of the tmv llc joint venture with dmb associates 
for  we had a net loss of  compared to net income of  for revenues from operations for grew  to  expenses from operations for were  an increase of  when compared to the growth in revenue was due to an improvement in revenue from land sales  increased royalties from oil and minerals  and higher leasing revenue 
our royalty income from oil and minerals grew due to higher prices for oil and cement 
leasing revenue increased due to higher revenues from our power plant lease 
the largest components of the increase in expense for the year were staffing costs  including higher stock compensation expense  a significant portion of which was a non recurring payment incurred upon execution of the tmv llc joint venture agreement  cost of sales related to our land sales transactions  higher farming crop costs including fixed water  and increased operational costs related to water  repairs and fuel 
during  we will continue to invest funds toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process which could take several years 
during the entitlement process  our net income will fluctuate from year to year based upon commodity prices  production within our farming segment  and the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial developments 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides the reader of our financial statements with a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each business segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  our future ability to utilize deferred tax assets  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the 
table of contents foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from lease revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectibility 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
royalty revenues are contractually defined and are generally based upon production 
lease revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to record these sales 
sfas no 
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas no 
requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold  or be required to develop the property in the future or construct facilities or off site improvements 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventory costs are recognized  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
it is not unusual for portions of our almond crop to be sold in the year following the harvest 
orchard almonds  pistachios  and walnuts revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenue to be  or per pound on average  pistachio revenue to be  or per pound on average  and walnut revenue to be  or per pound on average 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound  and walnut prices have ranged from to per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were 
from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to 
table of contents per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimated range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by   and  in  and respectively 
the adjustments in these years are related to continuing increases in almond  pistachio and walnut prices prior to the receipt of our final scheduled payments 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during and  per square foot of cost was allocated to sold and leased land as a cost of development 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation 
table of contents compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted 
we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in three segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within either of our real estate segments or our farming segment that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  salary growth  retirement rates  expected contributions  inflation  expected return on plan assets  and 
table of contents mortality rates the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our periodic pension cost would increase or decrease approximately  and our projected benefit obligation would increase or decrease approximately  stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of sfas no 
r  share based payments in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
during   of compensation expense related to grants of stock options was reflected in net income 
no stock options were granted during or we have not issued any stock options to employees or directors since january the compensation expense recognized during is related to options with final vesting dates in all of our stock options are fully vested and all related expenses have been recognized in our financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common stock and stock option information  for additional information regarding stock options 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures 
if our estimates of performance shares vesting were to change by  stock compensation expense would increase or decrease by  depending on whether the change in estimate increased or decreased shares vesting 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation plan  for total stock compensation expense related to stock grants

table of contents results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial our commercial industrial segment profits during decreased  or  when compared to segment profits 
the decline in segment profits was driven by an increase in expenses of  that more than offset the  increase in revenues 
the most significant increases in expenses were in compensation costs due to additional staff 
we also experienced increased contract and professional service costs related to the issuance of community facilities district bonds  or cfd bonds  for tic west  legal costs related to a pending land sale  and costs related to a lease and updated operating agreements with the current travel centers of america 
property taxes increased due to higher special tax assessments related to outstanding cfd bonds 
increases in many routine operating costs such as fuel  utilities and repairs were driven by underlying higher petroleum prices since many of these items are produced using petroleum derived products 
water costs also increased in this segment due to higher water costs within the local water district 
these increased expenses were partially offset by improved revenues 
in  we completed the construction commitments required by our land sales agreements with in n out and petro 
completion of these improvements resulted in recognition of the remaining  of revenues relating to these sales 
in we recognized  of this sales revenue 
improvements from both base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine accounted for an increase in revenues of  revenues received from ancillary land use increased  partially offsetting these increases was a net decline of  in mineral revenues due to decreased production of sand rock mined by our lessee and from our tenant s planned facility maintenance 
a decrease in new construction in the near term could continue to cause a decline in the amount of rock aggregate product  and cement that our lessee s produce and for which we receive a royalty percentage  however  higher oil prices are helping to offset these declines 
in we will be focused on continuing the marketing and development of tic west and beginning the marketing and development of commercial industrial product within tic east 
in july construction on tic east was cleared for commencement as the fifth circuit court of appeals in fresno  california upheld the lower court ruling allowing the company to begin development 
we also anticipate receiving final approval in on our foreign trade zone or ftz  application from the us foreign trade zone board 
approval of our application for acres of land at tic was delayed due to us customs and border protection issues related to resource management and jurisdictional oversight 
during december  the tenant of the power plant lease  calpine  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
on june   we received notification that the bankruptcy court had affirmed the power plant lease as part of the bankruptcy reorganization 
on january   calpine emerged from its bankruptcy reorganization 
based on past operating history and 
table of contents calpine s emergence from bankruptcy  we do not expect any changes in our business relationship with calpine that would negatively impact operating revenues 
our marketing efforts for tic east and west continue to focus on educating potential users about the logistical benefits of our site and the success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
we believe that as california s population continues to grow  we will continue to see increases in industrial activity at tic 
our development strategy fits very well within the logistics model that companies are using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
we believe that our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size will provide us with a potential marketing advantage 
a potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
temporary or long term downturns in the economy can also have an adverse impact on our ability to sell or lease our industrial commercial product 
while we have not experienced declining interest in our developments by potential tenants  declining profitability of these potential tenants as a result of a slowing economy is possible in the near term future and could decrease the demand for our buildings 
the commercial industrial segment will continue to experience increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market 
infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 
our commercial industrial segment profits during increased  or  when compared to commercial industrial segment profits 
the improvement in commercial industrial segment profits was driven by an increase in revenues of  this increase resulted from land sales of  a  improvement in oil and minerals royalty revenue  and generally higher lease revenues  including those from our power plant lease with calpine 
revenue from the land sales were only partially recognized in due to incomplete commitments to construct offsite improvements 
the remaining revenues of  were recognized during the first half of as the construction commitments were completed 
oil and mineral royalties improved in due to the higher oil prices and higher prices for cement and rock aggregate product 
revenues from the power plant lease increased due to improved variable rent payments based on the plant s production 
expenses during increased  compared to expenses during  primarily as a result of increased compensation costs  the cost of sales and commissions associated with the land sales  increased commercial water charges and increased corporate allocations 
the increase in compensation costs of  
table of contents was principally driven by the compensation costs associated with the execution of the joint venture agreement for tmv  the expensing of stock options and the cost associated with the stock grant program 
cost of sales and commissions increased as a direct result of the land sales to in n out burger and petro 
commercial water costs increased  due to higher operating costs and water costs within the local water district 
corporate allocations increased  as the commercial industrial segment s revenues and assets increased in relation to other operating segments 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
real estate resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
each of our resort residential projects is being developed through a joint venture in which the company is a partner 
such joint venture agreements provide a source of capital and allow the significant costs and business risks inherent in these projects to be shared with our venture partners 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  during  an increase of  or when compared to the prior year 
the increase in expenses when compared to was attributable to increased staffing costs of  including salary and stock compensation costs net of amounts capitalized for additional professional staff to administer and oversee our residential projects 
these employees monitor regulatory and environmental issues and provide necessary oversight functions for our joint ventures 
the increase in cost for this additional staff more than offset the absence of the tmv related compensation costs that were incurred in temporary office accommodation for these additional staff resulted in an increase in lease costs in as compared to offsetting these increases was a decline in professional service fees due to the absence of tmv related formation costs and reduced lake maintenance costs due to the lack of rainfall 
near term activities within this segment will be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  and tmv  located in kern county 
the resort residential segment will continue to experience increases in costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue the entitlement process for the above developments 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the likelihood of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
it could take several years to ultimately receive the required regulatory approvals 
in the course of pursuing these development activities we routinely engage in conversations with environmental groups and government agencies that could have an interest in or influence over the planned future activities that we undertake on our land 
land development impacts diverse groups with varying concerns and we regularly meet with many of these groups to insure that we address these concerns proactively in order to allow our development plans to proceed with the most amount of support and concurrence 
from time to time  we have granted conservation easements  sold land and taken other similar steps to facilitate development activities 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 

table of contents the recent downturn in the housing industry has not impacted our business plans to date 
since we are in the entitlement phase of development  we currently do not have an approved project and therefore we do not have inventory for sale in the market 
the housing industry downturn has impacted the perception of current land values due to the numerous write downs home builders have recently taken regarding land inventory 
this perception of land value has impacted our stock price but has not impacted the values within our active industrial development 
in the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  an increase of  when compared to the increase in expenses in compared to was mainly attributable to increased compensation costs of  compensation related to the execution of the tmv llc joint venture  stock option and stock grant expenses and the addition of staff to the resort residential segment all contributed to this increase 
contract and professional service fees relating to the completion of the tmv llc joint venture agreement and to other environmental programs and research increased  additionally  costs associated with lake maintenance increased  in compared to these increases were partially offset by decreased marketing and insurance costs 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
farming farming segment profits were  in  an increase of  or  when compared to the prior year 
the improvement in farming segment profits is due to improved revenues of  more than offsetting increased expenses of  the increase in revenues is driven by significantly higher yields for both pistachios and walnuts as compared to yields 
these improvements were partially offset by lower land lease revenues 
expenses in our farming segment increased  primarily due to higher costs associated with the production of our crops due to increased wages  chemicals and fertilizers that are derived from petroleum based products 
in  crop production costs increased  compared to  but this increase was offset by a decline in water costs of  in due to a allocation of water from the local water district 
the increased crop production costs were also offset by a decline in administrative salary costs of  due to the absence of the tmv related formation compensation costs in grape revenues for the crop declined  as compared to due to slightly lower prices 
grape production in increased by approximately tons as compared to  but the lower grape prices more than offset this increase 
grape prices are remaining relatively stable in spite of this slight decline in prices in the expected future demand for our product led to additional plantings in from which we expect the first crop in we have long term contracts for our grape crops ranging from three to ten years 
almond revenues of  in were in line with revenues of  our almond revenues include  of revenue from the sale of crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of crop 
table of contents almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
almond prices have fallen from the record levels experienced in late  but are still relatively high compared to historical prices 
total production of almonds was approximately  pounds in as compared to  pounds in we are carrying approximately  pounds of our almond crop into as they were unsold at december  in we carried over approximately  pounds of almonds into these amounts are held at the lower of cost or market on our balance sheet and are classified as inventory 
thus far in  the price for almonds has remained relatively stable  but the demand has improved as compared to demand in late when there was a notable temporary absence of buyers in the market 
we do not expect the current range of almond prices of to to continue to climb over an extended period of time  but we do expect prices to stay above historical averages due to current demand levels 
our long term expectations are that our almond crop prices will decrease based on industry projections that almond production will continue to increase in the future 
pistachio revenues increased  in to  yields increased  pounds due to being an on production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios and this improved yield more than offset the decline in prices from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price decline for pistachios that we experienced is attributable to the large production increase in we expect our revenues from pistachios to decline when compared to due primarily to lower production yields for this off production year 
if prices continue to decline  our revenues will be adversely impacted 
walnut revenues from the crop were  an increase of  when compared to the crop 
the walnut yields improved  pounds due to better weather conditions for walnut crops in as compared to we also recognized  of insurance proceeds during related to the walnut crop 
due to the significant decline in the walnut crop yield of less than of its average expected production  the crop qualified for an insurance payment 
the inconsistent performance of the walnuts in the last several years has led us to remove these trees from production in order to prepare for a new rubired grape vineyard 
we began removal of the trees in late all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current worldwide grape production more in line with worldwide demand  the pressure on prices has been alleviated at the present time and grape prices should stabilize at current levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios will increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not continue to keep pace with production 
a positive factor for the almond industry is that demand for product has remained very strong both in the united states and in export markets and at this time this trend is expected to continue 
however  improved global production or a significant increase in the value of the dollar could negatively impact exports and hurt the current pricing for almonds 

table of contents farming segment profits were  in  a decrease of  when compared to the decline in farming segment profits was due to both a decrease in farm revenues of  and increased expenses of  the drop in revenue was primarily due to a decline in crop revenues of  combined with the absence of the prior year s water settlement amount of  higher compensation costs  fixed water costs  corporate allocations  insurance and the direct costs incurred to produce the farm crops all contributed to the increase in farming expenses 
staffing costs increased  due to compensation related to the successful completion of the tmv llc joint venture agreement  the commencement of expensing of stock options  higher stock grant expense and costs for additional staff 
water costs increased  due to higher variable water cost charges that are related to the movement of water out of the california aqueduct to our orchards and vineyards 
grape revenues for the crop of  represented a marginal decline compared to the grape crop revenue of  a drop in grape production in of tons contributed to the decreased revenue and resulted from the late completion of the harvest 
almond revenues increased  during to  the increase in almond revenue was primarily the result of the large carryover of approximately  pounds of crop almonds that were sold during these almonds were inventoried at the end of and contributed  to revenue 
the revenues from the crop carryover in exceeded the comparable carryover of crop sales revenue of  in by  almond revenues generated from the crop year were  a decline when compared to the revenues from the crop year of  total production of almonds was approximately  pounds in  an increase of  over of the total almond production  approximately  pounds were carried in year end inventory 
pistachio revenue totaled  in  a decrease of  when compared to the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decline in production of  pounds combined with a price decline from per pound in to per pound in this change in production accounted for approximately  of the decrease in revenue when compared to  while the change in price accounted for the remainder of the difference 
the decrease in price was attributable to the relatively smaller size of the pistachio nut compared to the producer cannot demand the same level of pricing for a smaller product  which resulted in the lower prices 
walnut revenue from the crop was  compared to  in additional crop revenues of  were recognized in  due to grower price adjustments 
our walnut crop production only reached of our crop level and consequently qualified for an insurance payment under catastrophic insurance 
the age of our walnut orchard contributed to the decline in production

interest investment income for of  represented a  increase compared to this increase in investment income was due to an increase in average funds invested during compared to  and improving yields on new invested funds 
similarly  investment income for 
table of contents of  represented a  increase over the amounts for the same reasons that contributed to the increase in  in addition to the receipt of interest on loans to joint ventures 
interest expense was  in  the same as in both and interest incurred and paid during was  compared to  in and  in  of which   and  respectively were capitalized 
corporate expenses corporate expenses decreased  to  during the decrease during is due primarily to the absence of  of compensation costs incurred in upon successful completion of the tmv llc joint venture agreement 
charitable donations decreased in by  because the prior year included contributions of stock that were not repeated in directors stock compensation costs decreased  in due to a decline in the stock price used to compute the expense 
corporate expenses increased  to  during the increase during was due to increased charitable donations of  higher staffing costs  expensing of stock options  and non recurring cash and stock compensation cost of  that was incurred upon execution of the tmv llc joint venture agreement 
these increases were partially offset in by the allocation of more costs to operating segments and a decrease in our delaware holding company expenses 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures 
the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the gain that was realized on the sale of the industrial building owned by the tejon dermody joint venture 
the building was sold for a pretax gain of  of which we recognized 
as a result of the divestiture of tejon dermody s primary asset  this joint venture is in the process of being dissolved 
we do not anticipate any material costs will be incurred during this process which should be completed during the balance of the net earnings from joint ventures consisted of earnings from petro of  and losses from five west parcel of  losses from tmv llc of  and losses from centennial founders of  earnings from our petro joint venture continued to improve in due to improved gross margins and cost reductions 
our original partner in the petro joint venture  petro stopping centers  was purchased by travel centers of america in however  this change of ownership has had no impact on the operations of our jointly owned petro travel plaza llc  and we do not anticipate any impact in the future 
losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in within our centennial joint venture two of our partners  pardee homes and standard pacific  are home builders 
as with other home builders their businesses have declined over the last eighteen months and their internal financing has become more difficult 
at the present time  despite the current market in housing  both of these partners continue to be committed to the 
table of contents centennial development 
if it becomes necessary for one or more of our current partners to leave the joint venture  the centennial joint venture operating agreement requires the exiting partner to leave its capital contributions in the venture 
its capital investment would be paid back in the future from operating profits 
construction of a  square foot speculative industrial building began in and the building was completed during february this building is being constructed by our five west parcel joint venture and is financed by a construction loan that matures in potential tenants have shown interest in the building and we anticipate leasing the building in currently  approximately  square feet within the building is being leased on a temporary basis by ikea 
during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures 
our portion of earnings consisted of profits from the petro joint venture of  losses from the tejon dermody joint venture of  losses from the centennial joint venture of  losses from the five west parcel joint venture of  and a loss from the tmv llc joint venture of  during  the petro joint venture produced a significant increase in total profits when compared to the increase in was largely due to lower operating costs and improved fuel margins 
operating losses improved within the tejon dermody joint venture due to the leasing of a building within that joint venture during the third quarter of the centennial joint venture loss increased  when compared to the prior year due to a decrease in revenues from hay and alfalfa sales 
income taxes for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
the tax expense for was  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
out tax liability at december  of  reflects full utilization of our net operating loss and other available carry forwards 
additionally  temporary timing differences and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options reduced our liability 
for  we had net deferred tax assets of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  stock grant expense and deferred accounting gains on land sales 
deferred tax liabilities consist of deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our strong financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals  build infrastructure for our developments  ensure adequate future water supplies  and provide funds for general land development activities 

table of contents within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash and marketable securities decreased in due to a variety of factors 
significant cash inflows including net maturities of investment securities of  distributions of  from joint ventures  and cash from the exercise of stock options of  were more than offset by investments in our real estate projects and joint ventures of  purchases of water inventory of  and tax payments of  the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operations during increased to  from  in  primarily as a result of the increase in net revenue 
the non cash nature of some of our operating expenses such as stock compensation and depreciation also helped to improve net cash  while increases in deferred taxes  prepaid expenses  inventories  accounts receivable and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures utilized operating funds 
net cash provided by operations during decreased to  from  in the decrease in was due to the operating loss incurred in coupled with increases in deferred tax assets  prepaid expenses and income tax payments which all utilized operating funds 
non cash expenses such as depreciation and stock compensation expense helped to offset the use of funds in during we invested  into our operations 
these investments were primarily related to investments in property and equipment including our real estate projects 
we also contributed  to our unconsolidated joint ventures with  of this amount invested in the five west parcel joint venture for construction of an industrial building 
maturing marketable securities  reimbursement proceeds from cfd bonds and a distribution from the five west parcel joint venture of  of equity upon securing a construction loan provided offsetting inflows of funds 
during we invested  into our operations 
these investments were primarily related to investments in marketable securities of  and in capital investment projects of  the capital investment projects are primarily related to our real estate development activities 
maturing marketable securities  proceeds from the sale of cfd bonds  and distributions of equity from joint ventures partially 
table of contents offset these uses 
the distribution of equity from joint ventures is related to the establishment of tmv llc and to the repayment of loans made to tejon dermody 
capital investments were  in compared to  in and  in capital investments for these years were primarily dominated by investments in our real estate projects and our farming operations 
capital investments in our real estate projects are primarily related to infrastructure development and to the capitalization of costs related to our entitlement activities in our real estate projects 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements for could be as high as  to  these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment for real estate development projects and approximately  of investment within our farm operations for the development of a new grape vineyard and the replacement of equipment 
in we expect to contribute  to our various joint ventures and make other capital investments of  of this other capital investment amount  we expect approximately  will be invested in the purchase of water inventory and water related contracts 
we are adding to our current water assets to help secure our ability to supply water to our future real estate developments and as a future investment  since we believe that the cost of water in california will continue to increase 
investments in water are expected to continue at varied levels in future years 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from cash received from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock based compensation 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during also resulted from cash received from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock based compensation 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
management considers our capital structure and financial condition to be solid 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than one percent  which is comparable to the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 
we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or float at less than the bank s prime lending rate 
during the term of this credit facility  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
any outstanding principal balance is due and payable in full in september this note is unsecured 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to 
table of contents provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed parcels  potential sale of assets  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through the community facilities district bond debt described below under off balance sheet arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities and  available on credit lines to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing from any of these sources or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements over the next few years 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of december   to be paid over the next five years payments due by period in thousands total year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt interest on fixed rate debt line of credit commitment fees cash contract commitments total contractual obligations the categories above include purchase obligations and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap 
a purchase obligation is defined in item a ii d of regulation s k as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on 
us 
and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
based on this definition  the table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  a small land lease  several vehicles  and a temporary trailer providing office space and average approximately  per month 

table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension and supplemental retirement plans 
any payments related to the supplemental executive retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company 
in addition  minimum pension funding requirements are not included above  as such amounts are not available for all periods presented 
during  we made approximately  in pension plan contributions  compared to  in pension plan contributions in we estimate that we will contribute approximately  to the pension plan in off balance sheet arrangements the following table shows contingent obligations we have with respect to the cfd 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total year years years after years other commercial commitments standby letter of credit total other commercial commitments the standby letter of credit is related to the issuance of cfd bonds by the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  a joint powers authority created by kern county and the tejon castac water district 
the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
the annual cost for this letter of credit is approximately  per year 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments 
the standby letter of credit  if drawn upon  would not have a material impact upon the company s liquidity  capital resources  or market or credit risk support 
this letter of credit is for a two year period and will be renewed if necessary in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 

table of contents the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poor s 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long term line of credit  which currently has no outstanding balance  and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the floating rate feature in our line of credit can expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  petro  an unconsolidated joint venture  has an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  of its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in november and is a contract to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement 
the interest rate swap fixed rate is 
the joint venture accounts for the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities 
we record our pro rata change in the fair market value of the interest rate swap in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company s portion of the fair value of the interest rate swap was a loss of  estimated fair value of the swap was determined by market price quotes as of december   received from the joint venture s bank 
market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of our marketable securities and debt obligations 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities long term debt weighted average interest rate interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities long term debt weighted average interest rate in comparison to the prior years  our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased related to the use of debt because there is no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has also decreased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have also decreased compared to the prior year 

table of contents commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to almond production and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded as actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are often recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of that amount   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds   related to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  so for each change in the price of pistachios  our receivable increases or decreases by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was per pound 
for every change in the price of walnuts  our receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from to over the last three years
