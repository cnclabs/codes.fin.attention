item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report  and with other factors described from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
our products are used by interventional neuroradiologists  interventional neurologists and neurosurgeons to treat both cerebral aneurysms responsible for hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial atherosclerosis which may lead to ischemic stroke 
hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are both significant causes of death and disability worldwide 
our product lines consist of endovascular systems that enable a physician to gain access to the brain in a minimally invasive manner through the vessels of the arterial system 
we believe our products provide a safe and reliable alternative to more invasive neurosurgical procedures for treating aneurysms 
our proprietary three dimensional  embolic coils automatically and rapidly deploy within an aneurysm  forming a scaffold that conforms to a wide diversity of aneurysm shapes and sizes 
we also supply accessories for use with our microcoils and other products for the treatment of neurovascular disease including microcatheters  guidewires and stents 
we plan on growing our business by continuing to penetrate our existing hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke markets  bringing new products and technologies to interventional neuroradiologists  interventional neurologists and neurosurgeons  and by entering new geographic territories such as asia where we commenced selling our products in japan through our distribution partner  goodman  in march additionally  on july   we 
table of contents entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with txf medical to market our products in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils 
we also sell stents  access products and accessories for use with our microcoils  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
geographically  our revenues are generally from sales to customers in the americas  europe and asia 
our products are shipped from our facilities in the united states  switzerland  the united kingdom  and a logistics facility in the netherlands  to either hospitals or distributors 
we invoice our customers upon shipment 
in select hospitals  our products are held on consignment  and remain on site  free of charge until used 
we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will generally increase in absolute dollars during those quarters in which our sales increase or we incur additional manufacturing costs in anticipation of the commercial introduction of new products 
furthermore  our gross margin percentage may decrease in those quarters in which we initiate sales of new products or product lines  or enter new geographic territories 
our product development efforts are primarily focused on expanding our current line of microcoils and broadening our product offerings in the hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke markets 
in august  we introduced our cerecyte microcoil product line and we have launched eight new products in the last months  including microcoils  stents  microcatheters and guidewires 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we introduced two new products the cashmere tm microcoil system and the enzo tm deflectable microcatheter 
the cashmere tm is a stretch resistant microcoil designed to provide stable framing or filling of aneurysms that may require a softer microcoil  such as those with irregular shapes or ruptured aneurysms 
the enzo tm deflectable microcatheter is designed to offer improved maneuverability through the brain s tortuous vasculature and to enable in vivo repositioning of the microcatheter in the aneurysm  allowing physicians to more efficiently fill aneurysms  which may lead to improved outcomes 
we intend to continue this product line expansion with the goal of continuing to increase our per procedure revenue 
we also intend to continue to expand our direct sales force in the north america and europe as necessary and enter the asian markets through distributors 
in march  we launched our sales and marketing efforts in japan through our distribution partner  goodman 
in december  we received regulatory approval to sell our stretch resistant microcoils in japan 
we continue to work with regulatory officials in japan to gain approval for our cerecyte microcoils 
we recorded product sales to goodman of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we are also preparing to enter china and have selected txf medical to be our distributor in china 
we will begin selling our products in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
however  the timing of these approvals are uncertain due to a pending review by the chinese state food and drug administration sfda of drug and medical device approvals granted during the term of the former sfda minister 
we believe this review process along with more stringent approval procedures will delay review and approval of applications for new products 
as a result  we did not recognize revenues from sales in china this fiscal year 
we currently anticipate that the broadening of our product line  the worldwide expansion of our direct sales force and our entry into the asian market will be primarily funded with our currently available cash and cash expected to be generated from product sales 
we introduced our first proprietary  three dimensional microcoil in may our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal since inception  we have been unprofitable 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that our current cash position and the cash expected to be generated from product sales will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development  manufacturing  and sales activities and expand geographically 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents recent developments on july   we entered into a five year  exclusive distribution agreement with txf medical 
under the terms of the distribution agreement  txf medical will promote and market our full line of products  as such products are approved  in china and is required to purchase a minimum of million of such products over the five year term of the agreement commencing upon regulatory approvals to maintain its exclusive distributor status in china  ranging from million during fiscal to million during fiscal we will begin distributing our products through txf medical in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
on october   we entered into a stock purchase agreement the revasc agreement with the cleveland clinic and revasc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the cleveland clinic  pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding stock of revasc from the cleveland clinic for an aggregate up front purchase price of million 
pursuant to the revasc agreement  we also agreed to pay the cleveland clinic up to an additional million in payments upon the achievement of certain milestones set forth in the revasc agreement  with minimum milestone payments of at least million due to the cleveland clinic upon the third anniversary of the closing of the purchase 
revasc was a party to a license agreement with the cleveland clinic the revasc license agreement pursuant to which the cleveland clinic granted revasc an exclusive license to its revascularization technology for the treatment of ischemic stroke 
in connection with the acquisition  the parties amended the revasc license agreement to provide  among other matters  for the payment to the cleveland clinic of certain royalties for sales of products based on the technology subject to the revasc license agreement 
we acquired only pre regulatory approved technology and did not assume any other assets or liabilities in connection with the acquisition of revasc 
accordingly  the agreement has been accounted for as a purchase of in process research and development and million  representing the up front purchase price of million plus future minimum milestone payments of million  was recorded as research and development expense during the third quarter of fiscal on december   we merged revasc into micrus 
following the merger  micrus became the direct recipient of the license of the revascularization technology from the cleveland clinic under the revasc license agreement 
on january   we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement with genesis 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed the rights to genesis fast funnel catheter and clot retrieval system for the treatment of ischemic stroke 
the transaction includes an initial up front payment of million  a future development milestone payment of  payable upon the earlier occurrence of the date of first commercial sale or september  and royalties on potential future product sales 
both the initial up front payment of million and future milestone payment of  were recorded as research and development expense upon the effective date of the genesis agreement 
on january   we entered into agreements with certain executive officers the accelerated employees to fully accelerate the vesting of options to purchase our common stock issued under our equity incentive plan and or our stock plan held by such accelerated employees if  within the period months prior or months following a change of control of the company or sale of substantially all of the company s assets  an accelerated employee ceases being employed by us because either such accelerated employee is involuntary terminated by us or any subsidiary without cause or such accelerated employee voluntarily quits within days of an event which constitutes good reason 
on january   we entered into an asset purchase and supply agreement the merit agreement with merit pursuant to which we sold our non neurological cardiac and peripheral catheter assets and technology the merit transaction 
the majority of the assets sold were originally acquired by us in november in connection with our purchase of vascon 
under the terms of the merit agreement  we also agreed to manufacture and supply certain guide catheters to merit for period of up to one year following the closing 
pursuant to the merit agreement  we received an up front payment of million and will receive an additional million upon the earlier to occur of the date that merit can independently manufacture  validate and commercially produce certain guide catheters or the one year anniversary of the closing 
in connection with the merit transaction  we also entered 
table of contents into a license agreement granting merit the right to use certain non patented intellectual property in the cardiology and peripheral radiology fields and a non competition agreement  whereby we agreed not to engage in certain competitive business activities in the fields of cardiology and peripheral radiology for a period of five years 
we delivered and transferred title to the acquired assets  primarily inventory related to the catheter products  to merit in february and march pursuant to the merit agreement  we must provide reasonable assistance to help merit build a production line for coronary guide catheters and may be required to train merit s personnel in manufacturing  validating and sterilizing coronary guide catheters 
we anticipate that the production line for coronary guide catheters will become fully operational in the second quarter of fiscal if requested by merit  we must provide reasonable assistance to help merit build production lines for peripheral guiding sheaths and or cardiovascular microcatheters 
merit must inform us within six months following the completion of the coronary guide catheters production line that this assistance will be needed 
though certain elements  namely the acquired assets and licensing rights  have been delivered as of march   we are still obligated to deliver the regulatory documentation and production line assistance 
because we lack the ability to separate the multiple obligations elements of this transaction  the up front payment of million  net of direct and incremental costs incurred and the net book value of assets transferred to merit  has been deferred until such time as all elements of the transaction are delivered

table of contents fiscal years ended march  and revenues years ended march  change dollars in thousands americas europe excluding the united kingdom united kingdom asia pacific total revenues our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
the overall increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the number of microcoil products sold during this period 
factors driving the increase included growth in the overall market for embolic coils  an increase in our share of both the domestic and foreign markets in which we participate  expansion of our direct and distributor sales force and the introduction of new products 
revenues from embolic coils increased to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the launch of the cashmere tm microcoil system and increased market penetration of the presidio microcoil system 
revenues from our non embolic and accessories products increased to million in fiscal compared with revenues of million in fiscal primarily due to the launch of the enzo tm deflectable microcatheter and volume increases across multiple product lines including our guiding catheters  guidewires and stent 
additionally  the increase in revenues was partially due to higher average selling prices as a result of increased sales of our more expensive cerecyte product sales in fiscal we expect our embolic and non embolic sales to increase in the future as a result of market growth  continued market penetration of products released during the past two years and our planned launch of the next generation microcoil system and an occlusion balloon catheter family 
products introduced in the past months comprised of our revenues in fiscal in december  we received regulatory approval to sell our stretch resistant microcoils in japan 
we continue to work with regulatory officials in japan to gain approval for our cerecyte microcoils 
the delay in these product approvals had an adverse impact on the revenues previously anticipated from sales in japan for fiscal we sold million of our regulatory approved products in japan in fiscal  compared with revenues of million in fiscal we are also preparing to enter china through our distribution partner  txf medical  upon receiving regulatory approvals 
however  the timing of product approvals in china will be delayed due to a pending review by the sfda of drug and medical device approvals granted during the term of the former sfda minister 
we currently believe this review process along with more stringent approval procedures will delay review and approval of applications for new products 
as a result  we did not recognize revenues from sales in china this fiscal year

gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales of higher margin products  partially offset by higher levels of distributor sales of lower margin products primarily in japan and certain european markets 
we expect our gross margin to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of our product sales 
operating expenses research and development years ended march  change dollars in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  and testing of new products 
such costs are expensed as they are incurred and include salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to outside consultants  and other direct and indirect costs related to research and product development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million for technology acquisition costs related to an in process research and development charge in connection with the acquisition of revasc to obtain the rights to pre regulatory approved revascularization technology and the costs associated with the acquisition of occlusion technology from genesis 
in addition  there was an increase of million related to increased headcount  an increase of million related to product testing  outside services and supplies  as well as an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
in fiscal and  approximately and  respectively  of our research and development costs were attributable to our subsidiary  mdt  formed on november  in connection with the acquisition of vascon 
we expect our base research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional development personnel  continue work on product developments  and expand our existing product line 
sales and marketing years ended march  change dollars in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs of our direct sales force and marketing personnel  as well as overhead costs related to these activities 
also included are costs associated with promotional literature and videos  trade show participation  and education and training of physicians 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in travel  recruiting and personnel costs due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel in the north america  europe and asia  an increase of million in sales incentives resulting from higher level of sales and changes in the sales compensation structure  an increase of million in trade show  meeting and conference costs  an increase of million in market research costs  as well as an increase of  in stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of  in outside service  consulting and graphic design costs 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase the size of our direct sales force and clinical support group  increase spending on additional sales and marketing programs and expand into additional geographic territories 

table of contents general and administrative years ended march  change dollars in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  human resources  facilities  information technology  insurance  and professional services 
professional services are principally comprised of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and information technology consulting 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million related to higher finance and administrative personnel costs due to increased headcount  as well as an increase of million in legal fees primarily related to professional fees for the services of attorneys and third party accountants in connection with the united states department of justice monitorship

other income  net years ended march  change dollars in thousands interest and investment income interest expense other income  net total other income  net other income  net consists primarily of investment income and foreign currency gains and losses 
total other income  net decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in interest and investment income resulting from lower average cash and investment balances earning interest and higher foreign exchange losses related to a loan made to micrus sa  partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange gains resulting from differences in exchange rates between the time of the recording of the transaction and settlement of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
income taxes effective april   we adopted financial accounting standards interpretation no 
fin  which requires that we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it becomes more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a  increase in our unrecognized tax benefits 
none was accounted for as an increase in the april  balance of accumulated deficit since the benefit relates to attribute carryovers for which the related deferred tax asset was subject to a full valuation allowance 
at the adoption date of april  and at march   we had no accrued interest or penalties related to tax contingencies 
since the unrecognized tax benefit relates to attribute carryover for which the related deferred tax asset was subject to a full valuation allowance  the recognition of the unrecognized tax benefits will not affect our effective tax rate 
we have elected to include interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
we do not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at march  will significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
because of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  substantially all of our tax years  dating to inception in  remain open to federal tax examination 
most state and foreign jurisdictions have to open tax years at any point in time 

table of contents we have incurred net operating losses for both federal and state purposes since inception and  as a result  we have paid no federal or state income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  the net income tax benefit includes a deferred income tax expense of approximately  for the swiss subsidiary s operating profits and a deferred tax benefit of approximately  for the tax effect of the amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the neurologic transaction which is not deductible and the tax benefit of operating losses for our united kingdom subsidiary 
as of march   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the federal nols will expire at various dates beginning in  the state nols expire beginning in and the foreign nols will expire beginning in we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  as of march  the federal credits will expire beginning in and the state credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration  we have recorded a valuation allowance at march  to offset our federal and state deferred tax assets

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in doing so  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates  which we discuss below 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our accounting advisors  audit committee and board of directors 
although our significant policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of our microcoil product line to hospitals and third party distributors 
we also sell access products and accessories for use with our microcoils 
revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized generally upon shipment  after the receipt of a replenishment or purchase order  except sales made to our south american distributors 
due to historically longer delays in receiving payments and a higher level of write offs relating to our south american distributors  we have been unable to conclude that collectibility is reasonably assured at the time that the customer takes title to the inventory on sales to this class of customers 
accordingly  for this class of 
table of contents customers  we recognize revenues when collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally when cash is collected 
we are currently evaluating our experience with our south american distributors 
if we conclude that collectibility is reasonably assured upon shipment  we may begin to recognize revenue upon shipment to these distributors 
the outstanding accounts receivable balance at march  for our south american distributors was  and the related cost of goods sold that has been deferred was  allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering changes in customers financial condition and the aging of account receivable balances 
if there are unanticipated future events  this allowance may need to be adjusted 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we calculate an inventory provision for estimated obsolescence or excess inventories based upon historical scrap rates and assumptions about future demand for our coil products and market conditions 
our microcoil products have a three year shelf life 
our coil products are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of microcoils  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional provision based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
provision for excess and obsolete inventories result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between acquired in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible net assets and goodwill as required by gaap 
in process research and development is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized  subject to periodic review for impairment 
under our accounting policy  we perform an annual review of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
evaluations of possible impairment and  if applicable  adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate  among other factors  future cash flows over the life of the assets being evaluated  useful lives  and fair market values of our reporting units and assets 
when we conduct our evaluation of goodwill  the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require management judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
should conditions be different from management s last assessment  significant write downs of goodwill may be required 
in fiscal  we performed such evaluation and found no impairment 
however  any future write downs of goodwill would adversely affect our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our federal and state net deferred tax assets as of march  and  due to the uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carry forwards and accruals deductible in different periods 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas r on april  we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
due to the adoption of sfas r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant windfall tax benefits 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  
table of contents deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we have elected to follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing its research and development tax credit 
we will recognize the full effect of these deductions in the statements of operations when the valuation allowance is released 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires that we make certain assumptions that are factored into the valuation analysis  including estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
we determine expected volatilities based on median results of a peer group analysis of companies similar in size and financial leverage to us 
we have elected to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term as allowed by staff accounting bulletin sab  and extended by sab sab permits the use of the simplified method under certain conditions including a company s inability to rely on historical exercise data 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of our options 
the risk free rate is indexed to the five year treasury note interest at the date of grant and expected forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture information 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if  subsequently  based on management s assessment  it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or services will be rendered  then eitf requires that the capitalized advance payment be charged to expense 
eitf is

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have been exposed to risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to intercompany loans made to micrus sa  our swiss subsidiary  in in connection with its incorporation 
these loans are denominated in swiss francs and will fluctuate in value against the us dollar  causing us to recognize foreign exchange gains and losses 
the functional currency of our swiss subsidiary is the swiss franc 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiary is the pound sterling 
in europe  our revenues are denominated in swiss francs  euros  pounds sterling and other currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to market risk related to changes between the swiss franc and these other currencies 
if the swiss franc appreciates against the currencies in which our receivables are denominated  we will recognize foreign currency losses 
for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  the financial results of our swiss subsidiary are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates during the applicable period 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the swiss franc versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a loss of  related to our loan with micrus sa and a  increase in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus sa as of march  a hypothetical decline in the value of the pound sterling versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a  decrease in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus uk as of march  a hypothetical decline in the value of the euro versus the swiss franc would cause us to recognize a loss of  based on our foreign denominated receivables as of march  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in future periods  we believe a greater portion of our revenues could be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  thereby increasing our exposure to exchange rate gains and losses on non united states currency transactions 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our currency exposure merits  we may consider entering into transactions to help mitigate that risk 
we currently have not entered into financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our cash is invested in bank deposits and money market funds denominated in us dollars 
the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk  which is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates
