janumet has been approved  as an adjunct to diet and exercise  to improve blood sugar glucose control in adult patients with type diabetes who are not adequately controlled on metformin or sitagliptin alone  or in patients already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin 
on october   the fda granted isentress accelerated approval for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv infection in treatment experienced adult patients who have evidence of viral replication and hiv strains resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents 
isentress is the first medicine to be approved in a new class of antiretroviral drugs called integrase inhibitors 
isentress works by inhibiting the insertion of hiv dna into human dna by the integrase enzyme 
inhibiting integrase from performing this essential function limits the ability of the virus to replicate and infect new cells 
the fda s decision was based on a week analysis of clinical trials in which isentress  in combination with optimized background therapy in treatment experienced patients  provided significant reductions in hiv rna viral load and increases in cd cell counts 
in february  the company announced week data that demonstrated isentress  in combination with other anti hiv medicines  maintained significant hiv viral load suppression and increased cd cell counts through weeks of therapy compared to placebo in combination with anti hiv medicines  in two phase iii studies of treatment experienced patients failing antiretroviral therapies 
patients in the studies had hiv resistant to at least one drug in each of three classes of oral antiretroviral medicines 
by the end of  the medicine was approved for use in the eu  canada and mexico 
merck is also conducting phase iii clinical trials of isentress in the treatment na ve previously untreated hiv population 
potent antiretroviral activity has been demonstrated with no significant changes in serum lipids at week and isentress was generally well tolerated in patients

in  the company entered into an agreement with astra ab astra to develop and market astra products in the united states 
in  the company and astra formed an equally owned joint venture that developed and marketed most of astra s new prescription medicines in the united states including prilosec  the first in a class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors  which slows the production of acid from the cells of the stomach lining 
in  the company and astra restructured the joint venture whereby the company acquired astra s interest in the joint venture  renamed kbi inc kbi  and contributed kbi s operating assets to a new us limited partnership named astra pharmaceuticals  us the partnership  in which the company maintains a limited partner interest 
the partnership  renamed astrazeneca lp  became the exclusive distributor of the products for which kbi retained rights 
the company earns certain partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on sales of current and future kbi products 
the partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the partnership agreement  variable returns based  in part  upon sales of certain former astra usa  inc products  and a preferential return representing the company s share of undistributed partnership gaap earnings 
in conjunction with the restructuring  for a payment of million  astra purchased an option to buy the company s interest in the kbi products  excluding the company s interest in the gastrointestinal medicines nexium and prilosec 
the company also granted astra an option the shares option to buy the company s common stock interest in kbi  at an exercise price based on the present value of estimated future net sales of nexium and prilosec 
in april  astra merged with zeneca group plc  forming astrazeneca ab astrazeneca 
as a result of the merger  in exchange for the company s relinquishment of rights to future astra products with no existing or pending us patents at the time of the merger  astra paid million  which is subject to a true up calculation in that may require repayment of all or a portion of this amount

merial provides a comprehensive range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines to enhance the health  well being and performance of a wide range of animal species 
competition the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and often highly regulated 
global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and access 
such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively 
with its long standing emphasis on research and development  the company is well prepared to compete in the search for technological innovations 
additional resources to meet competition include quality control  flexibility to meet customer specifications  an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service 
the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through joint ventures and licenses and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions 
to enhance its product portfolio  the company continues to pursue external alliances  from early stage to late stage product opportunities  including joint ventures and targeted acquisitions 
however  the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product replacements  even for products protected by patents 
for example  the number of compounds available to treat diseases typically increases over time and has resulted in slowing the growth in sales of certain of the company s products 
legislation enacted in all states in the united states  particularly in the area of human pharmaceutical products  allows  encourages or  in a few instances  in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician  mandates the use of generic products those containing the same active chemical as an innovator s product rather than brand name products 
governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products have significantly reduced the sales of certain of the company s products no longer protected by patents  such as zocor  which lost market exclusivity in the us in and the company experienced a significant decline in zocor sales thereafter 
fosamax lost market exclusivity in the united states in february fosamax plus d will lose marketing exclusivity in the united states in april as a result of these events  the company expects significant declines in us fosamax and fosamax plus d sales 
distribution the company sells its human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers  hospitals  government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions 
human health vaccines are sold primarily to physicians  wholesalers  physician distributors and government entities 
the company s professional representatives communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccine products to health care professionals in private practice  group practices and managed care organizations 

table of contents raw materials raw materials and supplies  which are generally available from multiple sources  are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the company s pharmaceutical and vaccines segments 
government regulation and investigation the pharmaceutical industry is subject to global regulation by regional  country  state and local agencies 
of particular importance is the fda in the united states  which administers requirements covering the testing  approval  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in many cases  the fda requirements have increased the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states 
in  the food and drug administration modernization act the fda modernization act was passed and was the culmination of a comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the fda and to improve the regulation of drugs  medical devices and food 
the legislation was principally designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective drugs and biologics by expediting the premarket review process for new products 
a key provision of the legislation is the re authorization of the prescription drug user fee act of  which permits the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment fda resources earmarked for the review of human drug applications 
this helps provide the resources necessary to ensure the prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs 
in the united states  the government expanded health care access by enacting the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which was signed into law in december prescription drug coverage began on january  this legislation supports the company s goal of improving access to medicines by expanding insurance coverage  while preserving market based incentives for pharmaceutical innovation 
at the same time  the legislation will ensure that prescription drug costs will be controlled by competitive pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines 
the us congress has considered  and may consider again  proposals to increase the government s role in pharmaceutical pricing in the medicare program 
for many years  the pharmaceutical industry has been under federal and state oversight with the approval process for new drugs  drug safety  advertising and promotion  drug purchasing and reimbursement programs and formularies variously under review 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations  including the introduction of new drugs to the market  in this regulatory environment 
one type of federal initiative to contain federal health care spending is the prospective or capitated payment system  first implemented to reduce the rate of growth in medicare reimbursement to hospitals 
such a system establishes in advance a flat rate for reimbursement for health care for those patients for whom the payor is fiscally responsible 
this type of payment system and other cost containment systems are now widely used by public and private payors and have caused hospitals  health maintenance organizations and other customers of the company to be more cost conscious in their treatment decisions  including decisions regarding the medicines to be made available to their patients 
the company continues to work with private and federal employers to slow increases in health care costs 
further  the company s efforts to demonstrate that its medicines can help save costs in other areas have encouraged the use of the company s medicines and have helped offset the effects of increasing cost pressures 
also  federal and state governments have pursued methods to directly reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay 
for example  federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid  to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and disproportionate share hospitals hospitals meeting certain criteria  and to provide minimum discounts of off of a defined non federal average manufacturer price for purchases by certain components of the federal government such as the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense 
initiatives in some states seek rebates beyond the minimum required by medicaid legislation  in some cases for patients beyond those who are eligible for medicaid 
under the federal vaccines for children entitlement program  the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc funds and purchases recommended pediatric vaccines at a public sector price for the immunization of medicaid eligible  uninsured  native american and certain underinsured children 
the company was awarded a cdc contract in april which is in effect until march for the supply of pediatric vaccines for the vaccines for children program 
as of january   patients previously eligible for medicaid who are also medicare beneficiaries years and older or disabled left the state administered medicaid system to be covered by the new medicare prescription drug benefit 

table of contents outside the united states  the company encounters similar regulatory and legislative issues in most of the countries where it does business 
there  too  the primary thrust of governmental inquiry and action is toward determining drug safety and effectiveness  often with mechanisms for controlling the prices of or reimbursement for prescription drugs and the profits of prescription drug companies 
the eu has adopted directives concerning the classification  labeling  advertising  wholesale distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use 
the company s policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives  consequently  it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company s business 
in addition  certain countries within the eu  recognizing the economic importance of the research based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative medicines to society  are working with industry representatives to improve the competitive climate through a variety of means including market deregulation 
the european commission is conducting a pharmaceutical sector inquiry involving a number of companies concerning competition and the introduction of innovative and generic medicines 
as part of its inquiry  the company s offices in germany were inspected by the authorities beginning on january  the commission has not alleged that the company or any of its subsidiaries have engaged in any unlawful practices 
the company is cooperating with the commission in this sector inquiry 
as previously disclosed  in may the government of brazil issued a compulsory license for stocrin  which makes it possible for stocrin to be produced by a generic manufacturer despite the company s patent protection on stocrin 
in november  the government of thailand stated that it had issued a compulsory license for stocrin  despite the company s patent protection on stocrin  which the government of thailand contends makes it possible for stocrin to be produced by a generic manufacturer 
the company remains committed to exploring mutually acceptable agreements with the governments of brazil and thailand 
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is  therefore  subject to potential administrative actions 
such actions may include seizures of products and other civil and criminal sanctions 
under certain circumstances  the company on its own may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls 
the company believes that it should be able to compete effectively within this environment 
the company is subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally 
the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve  and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the company s business 
patents  trademarks and licenses patent protection is considered  in the aggregate  to be of material importance in the company s marketing of human health products in the united states and in most major foreign markets 
patents may cover products per se  pharmaceutical formulations  processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products or the uses of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage 

table of contents patent portfolios developed for products introduced by the company normally provide market exclusivity 
the company has the following key us patent protection and pediatric exclusivity for major marketed products product year of expiration in us cancidas compound formulation comvax cosopt cozaar crixivan compound formulation emend compound patent term restoration gardasil hyzaar invanz compound and pediatric exclusivity composition isentress januvia janumet maxalt compound other primaxin propecia recombivax rotateq product patent term restoration singulair trusopt zetia vytorin ezetimibe component in both products patent term restoration zolinza compound patent term restoration zostavax a basic patent is also in effect for sustiva stocrin efavirenz

the basic patent for aggrastat tirofiban hydrochloride in the united states was divested with the product in the company retains basic patents for aggrastat outside the united states 
the fda modernization act includes a pediatric exclusivity provision that may provide an additional six months of market exclusivity in the united states for indications of new or currently marketed drugs if certain agreed upon pediatric studies are completed by the applicant 
these exclusivity provisions were re authorized by the prescription drug user fee act passed in september current us patent law provides additional patent term under patent term restoration for periods when the patented product was under regulatory review before the fda 
for further information with respect to the company s patents  see patent litigation below 
while the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product  commercial benefits may continue to be derived from i later granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product  ii patents relating to the use of such product  iii patents relating to novel compositions and formulations  and iv in the united states  market exclusivity that may be available under federal law 
the effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it  the growth of the market  the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act or similar laws and regulations in other countries 
additions to market exclusivity are sought in the united states and other countries through all relevant laws  including laws increasing patent life 
some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset 
table of contents by a general increase in the number of  incentives for and use of generic products 
additionally  improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the united states and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties

the company maintains a number of long term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development 
merck s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company s research and development resources on disease areas such as atherosclerosis  hypertension  diabetes and obesity  novel vaccines  neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases and targeted oncology therapies 
these therapeutic areas were carefully chosen based on a set of criteria including unmet medical needs  scientific opportunity and commercial opportunity 
within these therapeutic areas  merck will commit resources to achieve research breadth and depth and to develop best in class targeted and differentiated products that are valued highly by patients  payers and physicians 
the company will also make focused investments in other areas of important unmet medical need 
in addition  the company will continue to pursue appropriate external licensing opportunities 
in the development of human health products  industry practice and government regulations in the united states and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation 
before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  recorded data on preclinical and clinical experience are included in the nda or the biologics license application to the fda for the required approval 
the development of certain other products is also subject to government regulations covering safety and efficacy in the united states and many foreign countries 
once the company s scientists discover a new compound that they believe has promise to treat a medical condition  the company commences preclinical testing with that compound 
preclinical testing includes laboratory testing and animal safety studies to gather data on chemistry  pharmacology and toxicology 
pending acceptable preclinical data  the company will initiate clinical testing in accordance with established regulatory requirements 
the clinical testing begins with phase i studies  which are designed to assess safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans 
if favorable  additional  larger phase ii studies are initiated to determine the efficacy of the compound in the affected population  define appropriate dosing for the compound  as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound s usefulness 
if data from the phase ii trials are satisfactory  the company commences large scale phase iii trials to confirm the compound s efficacy and safety 
upon completion of those trials  if satisfactory  the company submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing 
there can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed 

table of contents in the united states  the fda review process begins once a complete nda is submitted and received by the fda 
pursuant to the prescription drug user fee act  the fda review period targets for ndas or supplemental ndas is either six months  for priority review  or ten months  for a standard review 
within days after receipt of an nda  the fda determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review 
the fda also assesses  at that time  whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review 
once the review timelines are defined  the fda will act upon the application within those timelines  unless a major amendment has been submitted either at the company s own initiative or the fda s request to the pending application 
if this occurs  the fda may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information  but by no more than days 
extensions to the review period are communicated to the company
