item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations 
our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays 
however  we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal years and

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this form k  including the following risk factors  before investing in any of our securities 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of these risks 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the sec in the future 
our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products 
demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the credit markets 
our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications 
demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity  which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control 
the recent tightening in the credit markets could unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole 
although the implementation of the emergency economic stabilization act of and related measures is expected to improve liquidity in the financial markets and increase the availability of financing  the timing and magnitude of the impact is highly uncertain at this time 
future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels 
demand for our products is highly variable 
the short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products 
in some cases  unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers 
the combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales  profitability and cash flows 
our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod 
the primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets 
beginning in fiscal  a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which has continued through fiscal  when wire rod prices rose to a record high 
wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments  typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments 
although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should raw material costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements 
trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod 
the imposition of anti dumping margins by the department of commerce against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market  which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years 
if we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs 
foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results 
our pc strand business has experienced increasing competitive pressures from offshore producers exporting into the domestic market  particularly from china 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  we elected not to pursue certain pc strand business that had been negatively impacted by low priced import competition 
if we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers  or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower  our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted 
in  we  together with a coalition of us producers of pc strand  obtained a favorable determination from the itc in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of pc strand from brazil  india  korea  mexico and thailand were being dumped or sold in the united states at a price that was lower than the price in their home markets or their cost and had injured the domestic pc strand industry 
the international trade commission itc imposed anti dumping duties ranging from up to which had the effect of limiting the participation of these companies in the domestic market 
should domestic market conditions deteriorate in the future to where us producers could demonstrate that imports were being dumped in the us market and were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry  we would anticipate coordinating with other us producers to pursue similar trade cases  although no assurances can be provided that the outcome of such actions would be favorable 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures  operational interruptions and casualty losses 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products  including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires  explosions  accidents  adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions 
any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns  periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime 
furthermore  any operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures to remedy 
although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events  our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance 

table of contents our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs 
our employee benefit costs  particularly our medical and workers compensation costs  have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise 
in addition  higher prices for natural gas  electricity  fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs 
most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers 
although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs  there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance 
our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities 
although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business 
a material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition 
any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources and may not be available on favorable terms which could adversely impact our operations  growth plans  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
these laws and regulations  which are constantly evolving  are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
our production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees 
as of september   we employed people  of which were represented by a labor union employees at our wilmington  delaware facility and employees at our jacksonville  florida facility 
following the expiration of the delaware bargaining agreement on november   union employees continued to work without disruption while negotiations were in process on a new collective agreement  which was reached on august  and expires on november  the collective bargaining agreement with the union at the jacksonville facility expires on april of each year and is automatically renewed unless either party provides notification of its intent to modify or terminate the agreement 
should we experience a disruption of production at any facility  we have contingency plans in place that would enable us to continue serving our customers  although there can be no assurances that a strike  slowdown or work stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results 
our stock price can be volatile  often in connection with matters beyond our control 
equity markets in the united states have often been volatile 
during fiscal  our common stock traded as high as and as low as 
the following factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  several of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly and annual operating results  changes in our business outlook  changes in market valuations of companies in our markets  changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction  and announcements by us  our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations

item legal proceedings 
on november   dywidag systems international  inc dsi filed a third party lawsuit in the ohio court of claims alleging that certain epoxy coated strand sold by us to dsi in  and supplied by dsi to the ohio department of transportation odot for a bridge project  was defective 
the third party action seeks recovery of any damages which may be assessed against dsi in the action filed against it by odot  which allegedly could be in excess of million  plus million in damages allegedly incurred by dsi 
we had previously filed a lawsuit against dsi in the north carolina superior court in surry county on july  seeking recovery of million plus interest owed for other products sold by us to dsi and a judgment declaring that we had no liability to dsi arising out of the odot bridge project 
our north carolina lawsuit was subsequently removed by dsi to the us district court for the middle district of north carolina 
on march   the magistrate judge in the us district court issued his recommendation that our motion to remand the matter to the surry county court should be granted 
dsi has appealed the magistrate s recommendation to the district judge  who has not yet ruled on dsi s appeal 
on april   the ohio court of claims reached a preliminary ruling denying our motion to stay the proceedings against us in that court 
on june   the ohio court of claims reached a final ruling that dsi s action against us may proceed in that court 
we subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the ohio action on the grounds that it is barred by the relevant statute of limitations 
the ohio court has not yet ruled on this motion 
in any event  we intend to vigorously defend the claims asserted against us by dsi in addition to pursuing full recovery of the amounts owed to us by dsi 
we are also  from time to time  involved in various other lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including commercial  environmental and employment matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business

overview following our exit from the industrial wire business see note to the consolidated financial statements  our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry 
the results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our business strategy is focused on achieving leadership positions in our markets  operating as the lowest cost producer  and pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic reach 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information  actuarial estimates  historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such  are excluded from revenue 
concentration of credit risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the united states and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account 
we utilize credit insurance on certain accounts receivable due from customers located outside of the united states 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change significantly  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
while we believe our recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  we would follow normal collection procedures 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence to reflect the lower of the cost of the inventory or its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than our projections  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
accruals for self insured liabilities and litigation 
we accrue estimates of the probable costs related to self insured medical and workers compensation claims and legal matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with actuaries  our legal counsel and other advisors and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  adjustments to these reserves may be required in the future

impact of inflation we are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  and  to a much lesser extent  freight  energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes 
we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives 
however  our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics  and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs 
during  we implemented price increases in response to the unprecedented escalation in wire rod costs  materially increasing our net sales and earnings from continuing operations due to the consumption of lower cost inventory 
during and  inflation did not have a material impact on our net sales or earnings from continuing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  as defined by item a of regulation s k of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses

outlook our visibility for business conditions in fiscal is clouded by the increased uncertainty regarding future global economic conditions  tightening in the credit markets and the anticipated reduction in steel prices 
although we expect nonresidential construction  our primary demand driver  to decline from the levels of recent years  the magnitude of the decrease is highly uncertain at this time 
we anticipate residential construction will remain weak  which would continue to adversely affect shipments to customers that have greater exposure to the housing sector 
prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  have begun to soften in recent months following the unprecedented escalation that we experienced during fiscal as scrap costs for steel producers have plummeted and the availability of competitively priced imports has increased 
purchasers at all levels of the supply chain have scaled back their commitments to minimize inventories in response to the heightened level of uncertainty regarding future demand and speculation that prices could fall further 
these pricing pressures could be exacerbated in our pc strand business by the increase in irrationally priced imports from china 

table of contents in response to these challenges  we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business closely managing and controlling our expenses  aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs  and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing  selling and administrative activities 
we also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in recent years to expand and reconfigure our tennessee and florida pc strand facilities  and add new esm production lines in our north carolina and texas plants and a new standard welded wire reinforcing line at our delaware facility 
as we ramp up production on the new equipment  we anticipate dual benefits in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth when market conditions improve see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
in addition to these organic growth and cost reduction initiatives  we are continually evaluating potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that further our penetration in current markets served or expand our geographic reach 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices we are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign steel wire rod purchases for varying periods most recently monthly for domestic suppliers  depending upon market conditions  to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our requirements 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for steel wire rod 
our ability to acquire steel wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should wire rod costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
based on our shipments and average rod cost reflected in cost of sales  a increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a million decrease in our annual pre tax earnings assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices 
interest rates although we were debt free as of september   future borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange exposure we have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and any such transactions have not been material in the past 
we will occasionally hedge firm commitments for equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of september  during fiscal  a increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
