item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have divided our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a into the following five sections overview of holdings and fiscal year results of operations fiscal summary holdings consolidated results business segment results pro forma reconciliation analysis of consolidated financial condition contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements application of critical accounting policies overview of holdings holdings  the parent company of kmart and sears  was formed in connection with the march  merger of these two companies 
we are a broadline retailer and  at the end of fiscal  had  kmart and domestic full line stores and  specialty retail stores in the united states operating through kmart and sears and full line and specialty retail stores in canada operating through sears canada  a owned subsidiary 
we currently conduct our operations in three business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
prior to the merger  we operated a single business segment  kmart 
the nature of operations conducted within each of these segments is discussed within the business segments section of item in this form k 
the retail industry is highly competitive and as such  holdings faces significant challenges to achieve prominence 
however  we believe that we posses unique resources with which we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
these resources include the brands we own kenmore  craftsman  diehard  and lands end are one of our most important resources 
we believe that each of these four brands has significant recognition and value with customers 
home services  including installation  delivery  and repair  represent another important resource of our company 
our extensive network of in home and in store service businesses gives us the opportunity to retain long term relationships with our customers a chance to deliver value not only at the point of sale but also on an ongoing basis  and a chance to learn continuously about our customers and what they like and do not like about our products 
our existing store base is another resource  as our more than  domestic stores provide us with a physical presence in almost all major communities in the united states 
we also have viable on line businesses  which enhance our multi channel customer experience 
sears 
com  landsend 
com and partsdirect 
com are examples of on line channels where we engage and transact with our customers 
we are investing in these on line capabilities  as we believe that a compelling multi channel experience will be an important factor for success in the years and decades to come 
in addition to these resources  we believe that we have a solid balance sheet  with capacity to secure additional debt if necessary 
we own substantial inventory and real estate assets  and have also reduced our consolidated debt to billion billion with capital leases  which we consider low in relation to both our cash flow generation and market capitalization 
during january holdings announced that we would implement a new organizational structure and operating model designed to simplify the way our business lines are managed and create greater autonomy  accountability and focus for our business unit management teams 
the new model is intended to provide clarity and resolve issues more quickly  as well as allow us to optimize our resources to operate our businesses more effectively and efficiently 
while we have begun the process of transforming the organization to this new model  it will take some time to build the processes and information systems necessary to support the structure 
specific actions taken by us in  which were intended to build long term customer relationships and improve the profitability and or daily operations  include completed development of new internet technologies and migrated our selling websites to an improved e commerce platform 
this new platform positions us to attract and retain customers using a multichannel service approach to create a consistent experience across the channels and enhance the offerings and the shopping experience where channels intersect 
examples include store to web  web to store  special order catalogs and the sales hotline 
multichannel represents the potential for a sustainable growth vehicle for our company and represents an opportunity for us to unify and integrate the customer s experience 
improved holdings on line capabilities by launching searsprovider 
com  a new and efficient way to recruit independent service contractors to help us grow our home services business 
a significant amount of money is spent each year in the us on home repairs and remodeling projects 
searsprovider 
com allows our current and future service contractors to provide detailed information about their skills and the trades they service 
this knowledge will help us support current service needs  identify capabilities and launch new service offerings 
finding small businesses for select home projects is a new market and searsprovider 
com positions us to take advantage of this growing market 
worked to enhance our marketing efforts to better communicate the benefits of our product and service offerings 
for example  in august we introduced the ultimate appliance promise campaign 
the purpose of this campaign is to show our customers that we are uniquely positioned to meet their appliance needs by offering the largest selection of appliances  a price guarantee  one year of free service and support  and next day delivery and installation in many markets across the us continued to open lands end at sears shops  providing customers a convenient location to purchase lands end branded merchandise 
the consolidated specialty store within a store presentation carries merchandise for the entire family and incorporates dedicated consultants for enhanced customer service as well as internet kiosks connecting customers to the direct to consumer lands end business 
the lands end at sears shop network grew to stores in  including an enhanced  sq 
ft 
layout 
holdings currently intends to roll out additional lands end at sears shops in holdings further intends to assess the applicability of the insight gained from the lands end at sears shop format to other potential brand based store within a store opportunities 
expanded our dealer store operations by adding stores during the year 
these independently owned stores have historically been located in smaller communities  however we are beginning to open dealer stores in more urban areas 
these stores are smaller than full line stores and carry select merchandise  including kenmore  craftsman and diehard brand products 
we plan to continue our expansion of dealer stores in fiscal by continuing to open stores in both rural and urban neighborhoods across the us remodeled approximately kmart stores to include sears brand products 
we intend to continue our rollout of home appliances  including sears kenmore brand products  into kmart locations over the next several years as a means of expanding our points of distribution in response to competitor store growth 
as of february   approximately kmart stores  including certain of the remodeled locations  offered broad assortments of home appliances 
continued the process of converting the information technology systems of the sears domestic and kmart segments to a common platform 
during  we implemented a new common accounts payable system  as well as a new common general ledger and stock ledger  for kmart and sears domestic based on enhancements made to kmart s existing systems and processes 
the systems conversion establishes a common set of processes and systems for sears domestic and kmart 
certain of these initiatives and actions benefited our fiscal operating results  and the impact of such items is reflected in our operating results as presented in the below results of operations section 
other initiatives represent investments management has made with the belief that they further holdings longer term pursuit of our mission profitably building long term relationships and gaining prominence in the retail industry 
fiscal year effective march   we changed our fiscal year end from the last wednesday in january to the saturday closest to january st 
in fiscal  the saturday closest to january st was february  and  as a result  fiscal consisted of weeks 
both fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks 
unless otherwise stated  references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years 
the following fiscal periods are presented in this report 
fiscal year ended weeks february  february  january  sears canada s fiscal year end has historically been the saturday closest to december st and accordingly  we had consolidated sears canada s results on a one month lag 
during the fourth quarter of  sears canada changed its fiscal year end from the saturday nearest december st to the saturday nearest january st 
the change in sears canada s year end is considered a preferable change in accounting principle as it allows a full seasonal cycle  including the liquidation of holiday merchandise  for sears canada to be included in the results of holdings 
furthermore  sears canada s fiscal year end is now aligned with the fiscal year end of holdings and its results are no longer accounted for on a one month lag

fiscal summary the following discussion is designed to provide the reader with an overview of fiscal financial results  with particular emphasis on significant events and transactions that had a disproportionate effect on our results for the fiscal years presented 
further discussion regarding the operating performance of both holdings and our business segments follows this overview section 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes as of february   and the year then ended 
net income for fiscal  net income was million compared with net income of billion in fiscal the decrease in net income for the year reflects lower operating results at both sears domestic and kmart  partially offset by improved operating results at sears canada 
declines in the operating results of sears domestic and kmart are primarily the result of a decline in gross margin across most major merchandise categories  reflecting both sales declines  as well as an overall decline in our gross margin rate for the year 
interest and investment income also declined during the year as we settled our investments in total return swaps during the third quarter 
the negative impact of these declines on our fiscal results was only partially offset by declines in selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  income tax expense given lower levels of pre tax income in fiscal  and reduced interest expense given lower average outstanding borrowings 
earnings per diluted share and significant items the table below sets forth earnings per share results for our most recent three fiscal years  reflected on both a reported and pro forma basis for fiscal as explained above 
net income and earnings per diluted share results for all three fiscal years were impacted by certain significant items 
the magnitude of such items may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on earnings for any given period  affecting the comparability of our financial performance 
accordingly  management considers the aggregate impact of these items  along with reported results  in reviewing and evaluating our financial performance 
the impact of these items on diluted earnings per share is presented in the following table reported pro forma earnings per diluted share less hurricane related recoveries gain on sales of assets sears canada post retirement benefit plans curtailment gain dividend investment in sears mexico total return swap income loss visa mastercard settlement income tax settlements legal matter aig annuity insurance co  et al v 
sears roebuck restructuring charges cumulative effect of change in accounting earnings per diluted share excluding above items during fiscal  we recognized a gain of million million after tax or per diluted share for insurance recoveries received on hurricane claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal  a curtailment gain of million million after tax or per diluted share related to certain amendments made to sears canada s post retirement benefit plans  and a million million after tax or per diluted share dividend we received on our investment in sears mexico 
in addition  we recorded investment losses of million million after tax or per diluted share for fiscal on our total return swap investments see the interest and investment income section below for further details 
for fiscal  earnings per share included the following significant items pre tax gains of million million after tax or per diluted share derived from our investments in total return swaps  a million pre tax gain million after tax or per diluted share recorded by us for the aggregate amount received by holdings in june as part of the settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation  a tax benefit of million per diluted share related to the resolution of certain income tax matters  and a pre tax charge of million million after tax or per diluted share related to an unfavorable verdict in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this matter 
all three fiscal years were impacted by gains recorded on the sale of our assets 
these pre tax gains amounted to million million after tax and minority interest or per diluted share in fiscal  million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal  and million million after tax or per diluted share reported  million after tax or per diluted share pro forma in fiscal additionally  fiscal and were impacted by restructuring charges 
these pre tax charges were million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal  and million million after tax or per diluted share reported  million after tax or per diluted share pro forma in fiscal the charges for both fiscal and fiscal were recorded in connection with the merger and integration of sears and kmart s headquarters support functions  as well as in connection with productivity initiatives at sears canada 
further details pertaining to these restructuring charges are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal net income included an after tax charge of million per diluted share reported  per diluted share pro forma for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for certain indirect overhead costs included in inventory 
further details pertaining to this cumulative effect charge are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total revenues and comparable store sales fiscal domestic comparable store sales were down in the aggregate  with sears domestic declining and kmart declining 
in the current year declines were experienced across most major merchandise categories reflecting increased competition  the impact of a deteriorating housing market  the increased costs of consumer staples and a decrease in consumers disposable income 
in fiscal  notably larger declines within the home appliance and apparel categories were partially offset by increased sales of consumer electronics 
we believe that the decrease in sales in the home appliance category is directly related to a decrease in new residential housing starts during  as noted by us government census data 
we also believe that the sales decreases reflect the impact of a larger than normal increase in the inflation rate during as measured by the consumer price index  which negatively impacts consumers disposable income 
the increase in sales of consumer electronics reflects increased consumer demand and our ability to improve market share in this category in which the prices of products have increasingly become more commodity based 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which includes the holiday selling season  domestic comparable store sales declined in the aggregate  with sears domestic and kmart recording comparable store sales declines of and  respectively 
fourth quarter comparable sales results largely reflect the same factors as noted above 
declines for both the quarter and fiscal year include a more pronounced decline in comparable store sales in the month of january total revenues for fiscal were billion  as compared to revenues of billion for fiscal the decrease in fiscal revenues as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the above noted impact of lower domestic comparable store sales  and to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal comprised of weeks as compared to fiscal comprised of weeks 
we recorded a total of million in revenues during the rd week of fiscal theses declines were partially offset by sales increases at sears canada  primarily reflecting the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened in fiscal as we noted previously  we took specific actions in to make our products  brands and service offerings more responsive to the needs of our customers and thereby improve the trend in domestic sales results in the future 
the benefits derived from our efforts may be mitigated by continued weakness in the general economy  in addition to the impact of continued market share pressure as competitors engage in heavy promotional activity 
we expect these competitive trends to continue in the foreseeable future  which may negatively affect both our sales performance and results of operations 
gross margin rate gross margin as a percentage of merchandise sales and services revenue gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the basis point decline consisted of declines at both kmart and sears domestic  offset by an increase at sears canada 
our gross margin rate decreased across most domestic merchandise categories during fiscal primarily due to increased markdown activity  partially offset by increases in initial markons as a result of improved direct sourcing  contract negotiations and pricing efforts 
increased markdowns were taken throughout the year to clear higher levels of inventory  most notably within categories which are more seasonal in nature such as apparel and lawn and garden 
increased markdowns in seasonal apparel categories also resulted from the unfavorable impact of unseasonably warm weather prevalent during much of the fall in fiscal as noted previously  we experienced increased sales of consumer electronics during the year  however  these products have lower average margins which negatively impacted the overall margin rate of holdings for fiscal additionally  our buying and occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature  and therefore did not decrease as sales decreased during as a result  buying and occupancy costs were not absorbed by sales at the same rate as in and contributed basis points to the total decline in margin of basis points during the year 
selling and administrative expense rate selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues selling and administrative expense rate were in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal while total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  mainly as the result of reduced payroll and benefits expense  including lower performance based compensation  the current year selling and administrative rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
interest and investment income we recorded interest and investment income of million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal the decreased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to total return swap losses of million recognized in the current year as compared to total return swap income of million recognized in fiscal additionally  we earned less interest income during due to decreases in cash balances throughout the year 
these declines were partially offset by a million dividend received from our investment in sears mexico 
improved operating cash flow although fiscal presented significant challenges  we generated approximately billion in cash from operations during the year  which represents a million increase over fiscal the improvement in our cash flow resulted mainly from our management of inventory during the year  as compared to  even though net income decreased in fiscal reduction in debt assumed as part of the merger total outstanding debt and capital leases were reduced during the year by million  which represents a decrease of about in our debt levels from the end of fiscal this debt was primarily sears debt included in holdings consolidated balance sheet subsequent to the merger 
share repurchases we repurchased approximately million of our common shares in fiscal at a total cost of approximately billion under our common share repurchase program described under the financing activities and cash flows section below 
holdings consolidated results fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal revenues were billion as compared to billion in fiscal as discussed above  the decrease in fiscal revenues  as compared to reported revenues for fiscal  was primarily due to the above noted impact of lower domestic comparable store sales  and to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal comprised of weeks as compared to fiscal comprised of weeks 
we recorded a total of million in revenues during the rd week of fiscal theses declines were partially offset by sales increases at sears canada  primarily reflecting the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened in fiscal the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal gross margin rate declines at kmart and sears domestic were partially offset by an increase in the rate at sears canada 
as discussed previously  the decrease in margin rate relates to markdowns taken to clear excess levels of inventory  as well as reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels in fiscal the selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal as noted above  total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  mainly as the result of reduced payroll and benefits expense including lower performance based compensation 
however  the current year selling and administrative rate increased  primarily reflecting lower expense leverage resulting from lower overall sales levels 
depreciation and amortization was billion for fiscal  as compared to billion for fiscal the decreased expense for fiscal is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
gains on sales of assets were million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the fiscal gain was primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of our former kmart headquarters in troy  michigan 
restructuring charges were million for fiscal these charges included million for employee related termination costs associated with sears canada s restructuring initiatives implemented during fiscal  including a workforce reduction of approximately  associates  as well as million at kmart for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs associated with holdings home office integration efforts 
we did not incur any restructuring costs during fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
interest and investment income was million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal as discussed above  the decreased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to performance of investments in total return swaps and less interest earned on our cash balances  partially offset by a dividend received from our investment in sears mexico 
we incurred million in interest expense during fiscal  as compared to million last year 
the reduction in interest expense is attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings during fiscal other income is primarily comprised of bankruptcy related recoveries in the amount of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
bankruptcy related recoveries increased million in fiscal and represent amounts recovered from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
other income in fiscal also included income recorded relative to foreign currency forward contracts for which hedge accounting was not applied 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was relatively flat at in fiscal versus in fiscal the decrease in income tax expense for fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in pre tax income during the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed above  the reported consolidated statement of income for fiscal includes sears results of operations only for the period subsequent to the merger  or from march  forward 
we believe that presenting fiscal results on a pro forma basis  which includes sears results for the entire fiscal year  is important to an understanding and assessment of our results  trends and on going performance 
accordingly  we have provided an analysis of operating results for fiscal as compared to fiscal results presented on both a reported and a pro forma basis 
fiscal revenues were billion as compared to billion reported and billion pro forma in fiscal the increase in fiscal revenues  as compared to reported revenues for fiscal  was primarily due to the inclusion of sears for the entire year in fiscal and  to a lesser degree  the inclusion of an additional week of sales in fiscal fiscal revenues declined billion  or  to billion  as compared to fiscal pro forma revenues of billion  as a decline in comparable store sales of in the aggregate and the impact of kmart store closures were partially offset by the above noted additional week of sales recorded in fiscal  and to a lesser degree  sales increases in sears domestic s home services business 
the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma in fiscal gross margin rates improved across all business segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada  with the increase primarily reflecting improvements realized in our apparel businesses during the year 
the increase in margins from our apparel business during  and within women s apparel at sears domestic in particular  reflected the impact of having better product assortments in place relative to the improvement in assortments lowered apparel markdowns during fiscal relative to levels in fiscal additional markdowns were taken in the latter half of to clear excess fashion apparel given poor customer response to sears domestic full line store apparel offerings that year 
additionally  apparel gross margins at both kmart and sears domestic benefited from fiscal efforts to procure products at a lower cost to us including increased utilization of direct sourced merchandise  particularly at sears domestic  which had historically not utilized direct sourcing to the extent of its use at kmart 
also  sears domestic s home services and lands end businesses contributed to the overall improved gross margins for holdings during fiscal as was the case within other apparel businesses during fiscal  the improvement in lands end s gross margin reflected more extensive and effective use of direct sourced merchandise  as well as the favorable impact of pricing initiatives and stronger in season sales results 
the selling and administrative expense rate was in fiscal  as compared to reported and pro forma for fiscal the fiscal improvement primarily reflects improved expense management  with the most notable improvements made at sears canada due in part to the sale of sears canada s credit and financial products business in late fiscal depreciation and amortization was billion for fiscal  as compared to billion reported and billion pro forma for fiscal the increased expense for fiscal  as compared to the reported expense for fiscal  was primarily attributable to the inclusion of sears for the entire year in fiscal gains on sales of assets were million in fiscal  as compared to million reported and million pro forma for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in in connection with the sale of our former kmart headquarters in troy  michigan 
fiscal included a million gain on sale of business  which reflected a minority interest gain on the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations in november this gain had no impact on holdings net income as our entire impact was offset by increased minority interest expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
restructuring charges were million and million reported and pro forma for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these charges included charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  for employee related termination costs associated with sears canada restructuring initiatives implemented during fiscal  including a workforce reduction of approximately  associates  as well as million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  at kmart for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs associated with holdings home office integration efforts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
for fiscal  interest and investment income was million  as compared with million reported and million pro forma in fiscal the increased interest and investment income in fiscal was primarily due to total return swap income recognized during the year 
other income is primarily comprised of bankruptcy related recoveries 
bankruptcy related recoveries decreased million in fiscal and represent amounts recovered from vendors who had received cash payment for pre petition obligations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
the impact of lower bankruptcy related recoveries in fiscal as compared with fiscal was partially offset by increased income recorded relative to foreign currency forward contracts for which hedge accounting was not applied 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  with the increase primarily attributable to the fact that the effective rate in fiscal benefited from the november sale of sears canada s credit and financial services business being taxed at a capital gains rate  lowering the effective tax rate for fiscal effective january   we determined that it would be preferable to conform one of the accounting practices utilized by kmart to that of sears 
we changed our method of accounting for certain indirect overhead costs from inventoriable costs to period expenses 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  a change in accounting policy to conform the acquirer s policy to that of the acquired entity is treated as a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the accounting change  we recorded a charge of million  net of taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
the charge represents the amount of indirect costs reflected within inventory at the beginning of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail 
business segment results holdings has integrated many kmart and sears store support functions to more efficiently serve both formats  however  for purposes of reviewing operating performance and making asset allocation decisions  senior management has continued to utilize the reporting structures that existed independently for sears and kmart prior to the merger 
as a result  the following discussion of our business segments is organized into three segments kmart  sears domestic and sears canada 
kmart kmart results and key statistics were as follows millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income number of stores fiscal compared to fiscal comparable store sales and total sales decreased and  respectively  during fiscal the decline in kmart comparable store sales during fiscal compares to a decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal consistent with the results of holdings and the sears domestic segment  the current year decline in comparable store sales reflects the impact of an increasingly competitive retail environment  a decrease in consumer s disposable income and the increased costs of consumer staples 
comparable store sales declined across most major categories  most notably within the lawn and garden  apparel  drug store and general merchandise categories 
total sales for the weeks in fiscal decreased  or billion  compared to weeks in fiscal  mainly due to the macroeconomic factors discussed previously 
the decrease includes a decrease related to the impact of sales recorded during the rd week of fiscal year in the amount of million 
sales of our seasonal apparel were impacted by a change in weather patterns across most of the us during  including a cooler than normal spring and warmer than normal fall 
decreases in the home and hard lines categories reflect the impact of a declining housing market  as sales of lawn and garden items  as well as home appliances decreased throughout the year 
kmart generated billion in total gross margin in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal  with the billion decline reflecting the negative gross margin impact of lower overall sales  as well as a decline in kmart s gross margin rate 
for fiscal  kmart s gross margin rate was as compared to for fiscal  a decline of as a percentage of total revenues 
reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels  accounted for approximately of the total decline  with the remaining decline attributable to gross margin rate declines across a number of merchandise categories  most notably in the apparel and home categories 
increased markdowns had a negative impact on our margins in these categories as we made efforts to clear seasonal apparel  as well as lawn and garden and other home products affected by the slowdown in the housing market 
for fiscal  kmart s selling and administrative expense rate was  as compared to for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses included a million gain  representing kmart s portion of the settlement in the visa mastercard antitrust litigation 
excluding this gain  kmart s selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal while total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  mainly as the result of reduced payroll and benefits expense including lower performance based compensation  the current year selling and administrative rate increased  reflecting lower expense leverage against sales for this fiscal year 
kmart recorded million and million in gains on sales of assets during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gains recorded on sales of assets in fiscal included a million pre tax gain recognized in connection with our sale of kmart s former corporate headquarters in troy  michigan 
kmart recorded restructuring charges of million during fiscal the charges were for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs incurred in connection with holdings home office integration efforts initiated in fiscal no such charges were recorded in fiscal operating income was million in fiscal year  as compared to operating income of million in fiscal  a decline of million 
as discussed above  declines primarily reflect the negative gross margin impact of lower sales levels  as well as a decline in kmart s gross margin rate in in addition to the above noted decline in gross margin  the decline reflects  to a lesser degree  the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense  and lower gains on sales of assets in fiscal  partially offset by the favorable impact of lower selling and administrative expenses and a decrease in restructuring costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal comparable store sales and total sales decreased and  respectively  during fiscal the decline in kmart comparable store sales during fiscal compares to a decline in comparable store sales recorded for fiscal the fiscal decline in comparable store sales reflected the continued impact of increased competition and lower transaction volumes recorded across most businesses 
comparable store apparel sales increased for a second straight year during fiscal  but as was the case in fiscal  this improvement was more than offset by comparable store sales declines across most other kmart merchandise categories 
total sales in fiscal benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the week fiscal year  partially offset by the fact that million of sales were recorded during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of three additional days being included in fiscal due to our change from a wednesday to a saturday month end that year 
however  the net favorable impact on fiscal sales derived from these items approximately was more than offset by the negative impact of a reduction in the total number of kmart stores in operation during fiscal  as compared to fiscal store closures and conversions accounted for an approximate decline in total kmart sales for fiscal  as fiscal total sales benefited from sales generated at stores subsequently closed in fiscal  as well as partial year sales recorded in stores closed during fiscal a net total of kmart stores were closed during fiscal  including kmart stores converted to a sears essentials grand format 
the remaining balance of the decline in total sales for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the above noted decline in comparable store sales 
the gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the improvement reflected better margin management across a number of businesses  most notably within apparel  where an increased use of direct sourced merchandise obtained at a lower cost to us  as well as enhanced profitability of promotional activity improved gross margin 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses included a million gain  representing kmart s portion of the settlement in the visa mastercard antitrust litigation 
this gain accounted for approximately basis points of the improvement in the selling and administrative expense rate 
the remaining basis point improvement reflected lower costs across a number of expense categories  most notably store payroll and benefit costs  which were reduced in fiscal as a result of store payroll efficiency initiatives 
kmart recorded million and million in gains on sales of assets during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  with the increase for fiscal primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain recognized in fiscal in connection with our sale of kmart s former corporate headquarters in troy  michigan 
kmart recorded restructuring charges of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the charges were for relocation assistance and employee termination related costs incurred in connection with holdings home office integration efforts initiated in fiscal operating income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily as a function of improved expense management  as well as lower restructuring charges  as noted above 
the favorable impact on operating income derived from these factors  as well as the million gain recorded on the settlement of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation and the increased gains on asset sales  was partially offset by a decline in total gross margin dollars  as a result of lower overall sales levels  and  to a lesser degree  increased depreciation and amortization expense 
sears domestic as noted above  the consolidated statement of income for holdings includes sears domestic s results only for the period subsequent to march  for fiscal we believe that an understanding of our reported results and our ongoing financial performance is not complete without presenting sears domestic s results of operations on a pro forma basis for fiscal accordingly  in addition to providing the reported results for fiscal  and  the presentation below also provides the results of operations on a pro forma basis for fiscal sears domestic results and key statistics were as follows reported pro forma millions  except for number of stores merchandise sales and services cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization gain loss on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income number of full line stores specialty stores total domestic sears stores fiscal includes full line stores and sears essentials grand stores  fiscal includes full line stores and sears essentials grand stores  fiscal includes full line stores and sears essentials grand stores fiscal compared to fiscal merchandise sales and services revenues declined billion  or  to billion for fiscal  as compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal total fiscal revenues benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the week fiscal year 
excluding the impact of the rd week on sales in fiscal  total revenues declined billion in fiscal the decline was due primarily to an aggregate decrease in comparable store sales 
the decline in comparable store sales during fiscal was recorded across most categories and formats  with more pronounced declines in the home appliance  lawn and garden  tools and apparel categories  partially offset by increases within home electronics 
we believe the sales increase in home electronics reflects our gain in market share in this category  as well as increased market demand for flat panel televisions 
sales within the home appliance  lawn and garden and tools categories were weaker throughout fiscal  reflecting the impact of a weakening residential construction and housing market  as well as decreased sales of weather driven products  such as air conditioners  due to cooler than normal temperatures in the first half of the year 
with regard to apparel  we believe the decline in sales in reflects both the impact of cooler temperatures in the spring and unseasonably warm weather during the fall on sales of our seasonal apparel 
we believe apparel was also affected by the decline in general economic conditions  which affected sales of basic wear  including jeans  t shirts and other everyday items 
for fiscal  sears domestic generated billion in total gross margin  as compared to billion in fiscal  with the billion decline primarily reflecting the negative margin impact of lower overall sales levels  as well as a decline in sears domestic s gross margin rate for the year 
sears domestic s gross margin rate was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  a decline of as a percentage of total revenues 
reduced leverage of buying and occupancy costs  given lower overall sales levels  accounted for approximately of the total decline  with the remaining decline attributable to gross margin rate declines across a number of merchandise categories  most notably in the apparel and home categories 
increased markdowns had a negative impact on our margins in these categories as we made efforts to clear seasonal apparel  as well as appliances and other home improvement products affected by the slowdown in the housing market 
the decline was also attributable to a higher proportion of sales of home electronics  which traditionally have a lower margin rate 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal though total selling and administrative expenses declined million in fiscal  mainly as the result of reduced payroll and benefits expense including lower performance based compensation  the current year selling and administrative rate increased 
sears domestic s selling and administrative expense for fiscal included the favorable impact of a million gain recorded in connection with settlement of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation  offset by the recognition of a million liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in excluding these items  the selling and administrative expense rate for fiscal was 
consistent with the discussions of holdings expenses above  the increase in the rate primarily reflects lower expense leverage against sales for this fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to additional property and equipment becoming fully depreciated during the year  thereby decreasing our depreciable asset base 
for fiscal  sears domestic s operating income decreased million to million  as compared to billion in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower total gross margin dollars generated as a result of lower overall sales levels and a decline in gross margin rate  offset by million less in depreciation and amortization expense 
fiscal compared to fiscal the discussion below pertains to pro forma information in the table above for purposes of reviewing results for fiscal as compared to actual results for these pro forma results have been prepared assuming the merger occurred at the beginning of fiscal merchandise sales and services revenues declined billion  or  to billion for fiscal  as compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal the decline was due primarily to a decrease in comparable store sales  partially offset by an increase in the total number of full line stores in operation  as a number of kmart locations were converted to the sears essentials grand format during and  increased sales within home services  and the fact that fiscal revenues benefited from million in sales recorded during the rd week of the week fiscal year 
the decline in comparable store sales during fiscal was recorded across most categories and formats  with more pronounced declines in both the lawn and garden and home fashions categories  partially offset by sales increases within women s apparel 
the sales increase in women s apparel reflected what we believe were improved assortments in this business relative to sales within the lawn and garden category were weaker throughout fiscal  reflecting overall poor weather conditions prevalent during the majority of the summer selling season  the unfavorable impact of certain economic conditions  such as higher energy costs  on consumer demand for higher ticket discretionary purchases  and the absence of catastrophic weather events in the united states in the fall of  which drove sales of generators  chainsaws and other related power equipment during the fall of in regards to home fashions  we believe sales declines in fiscal reflect the impact of a poorly executed launch of new product lines within this category during the second quarter of fiscal also of note  the rate of comparable store sales declines within home appliances at sears domestic accelerated somewhat during the fourth quarter of fiscal  reflecting what we believe was the impact of both a slow housing market and increased competition 
gross margin rates improved at sears domestic  reaching for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the basis point improvement in gross margin rate realized during fiscal was due primarily to improved apparel margins as described above in the discussion of consolidated results 
also  the home services and lands end businesses contributed to the overall improved gross margins during fiscal as was the case within other apparel businesses during fiscal  the improvement in lands end s gross margin reflected more extensive and effective use of direct sourced merchandise  as well as the favorable impact of pricing initiatives and stronger in season sales results 
the selling and administrative expense rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the expense rate for fiscal was largely unchanged from  as expense reductions across a number of categories were offset by lower expense leverage given lower sales levels 
the expense reduction in fiscal included  most notably  reductions in both marketing and payroll and benefits  which accounted for approximately basis points and basis points of improvement in the overall rate  respectively  however  the benefit derived from these and other reductions was offset by lower expense leverage 
sears domestic s selling and administrative expense for fiscal included the favorable impact of a million gain recorded in connection with settlement of visa mastercard antitrust litigation in fiscal  and also benefited from the fact that fiscal expenses included million of merger related costs  however  the favorable impact derived from these items was more than offset by the recognition of a million liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a pre merger legal matter concerning sears roebuck s redemption of certain bonds in as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating income for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily as a function of increased gross margin dollars  as well as lower selling and administrative costs 
sears canada sears canada  a consolidated  owned subsidiary of sears  conducts retail and credit operations 
in november  sears canada completed the sale of its credit and financial services operations 
as noted above  the consolidated statement of income for holdings includes sears canada s results only for the period subsequent to march  for fiscal we believe that an understanding of our reported results and our ongoing financial performance is not complete without presenting sears canada s results of operations on a pro forma basis for fiscal accordingly  in addition to providing the reported results for fiscal  and fiscal  the presentation below also provides the results of operations on a pro forma basis for fiscal during the fourth quarter of  sears canada changed its fiscal year end from the saturday nearest december st to the saturday nearest january st

sears canada results and key statistics were as follows millions  except for number of stores reported pro forma merchandise sales and services credit and financial products revenues total revenues cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets gain on sale of business restructuring charges total costs and expenses operating income number of full line stores specialty stores total sears canada stores fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased to billion in fiscal  as compared to revenues of billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was mainly due to the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened during fiscal relative to fiscal the gross margin rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased to in the increase was primarily due to improved inventory management during the year  as well as the favorable impact of a stronger canadian dollar on the cost of imported merchandise 
the selling and administrative expense rate increased slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to small increases in advertising expense in connection with a program to discourage cross border shopping  which increased during the year due to a strengthening canadian dollar 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as discussed  the increase was the result of increased sales mainly due to the impact of favorable exchange rates in addition to increases in gross margin during the year  while controlling costs to ensure profitable growth 
the increase in is also partially due to the absence of restructuring charges during the year  as compared to million of such expenses incurred during fiscal compared to fiscal the discussion below pertains to pro forma information in the table above  which compares sears canada s results for fiscal with sears canada s results for fiscal these pro forma results have been prepared assuming the merger occurred at the beginning of fiscal total revenues increased to billion in fiscal  as compared to revenues of billion in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the impact of favorable exchange rates  as the canadian dollar strengthened during fiscal relative to fiscal excluding the impact of exchange rates  total revenues declined versus fiscal  primarily reflecting the impact of the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations in november the revenue stream from sears canada s credit and financial services operations was replaced in part by performance payments received pursuant to the strategic alliance with jpmorgan chase 
the performance payments are classified within merchandise sales and services and  along with the impact of favorable exchange rates  largely account for the increase in merchandise sales and services revenues as compared to fiscal sears canada comparable store sales declined during fiscal  as increased sales in major appliances and footwear were more than offset by declines across most other merchandise categories 
the gross margin rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased primarily due to the combined effect of improved inventory management and less inventory shrinkage  as well as the favorable impact of a stronger canadian dollar on the cost of imported merchandise 
the selling and administrative expense rate declined for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations  the positive impact of productivity initiatives initiated at sears canada in late fiscal  and a reduction in marketing costs 
restructuring charges of million and million were recognized during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  in connection with the above noted productivity initiatives 
operating income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal fiscal operating income included a gain on sale of business totaling million recorded to reflect the above noted minority interest gain on the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services business in november excluding this gain  operating income increased million in fiscal  as the impact of a decline in revenues resulting from the sale of sears canada s credit and financial services operations was more than offset by increased gross margin dollars and lower expenses  including million less in restructuring expenses

millions february  february  domestic cash and equivalents cash posted as collateral credit card deposits in transit total domestic cash and cash equivalents sears canada total cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of billion at february  as compared to billion at february  the decline in cash and cash equivalents from february  primarily reflects share repurchases made pursuant to our share repurchase program  as further discussed in the financing activities and cash flows section below 
during fiscal  we repurchased million common shares at a cost of billion 
other significant uses of cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year ended february  included the use of cash and cash equivalents to fund capital expenditures approximately million and an approximate million decrease in borrowings  net of repayments  as further detailed in the financing activities and cash flows section 
our invested cash may include  from time to time  investments in  but not limited to  commercial paper  us federal  state and municipal government securities  floating rate notes  repurchase agreements and money market funds 
cash amounts held in these short term investments are readily available to us and included million and million as of fiscal year end and fiscal year end  respectively  invested in support of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
additionally  as explained below  our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of surplus cash to edward s

we have posted cash collateral for certain outstanding letters of credit and self insurance programs 
such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents as it is readily available to us and we have the ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral 
credit card deposits in transit include deposits in transit from banks for payments related to third party credit card and debit card transactions

investment of available capital since the merger  our cash flows have exceeded our working capital  financing and capital investment needs  and management expects that our cash flows will continue to exceed our annual operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we have and will continue to invest in our businesses to improve the customer experience and provide the opportunity for attractive returns 
further  through february   we have repurchased billion of our common shares since the merger and may continue to repurchase shares subject to market conditions and board authorization 
in addition  we may pursue investments in the form of acquisitions  joint ventures and partnerships where we believe attractive returns can be obtained 
further  we may determine under certain market conditions that available capital is best utilized to fund investments that we believe offer us attractive return opportunities  whether or not related to our ongoing business activities 
as previously disclosed  our board of directors has delegated authority to direct investment of our surplus cash to our chairman  edward s 
lampert  subject to various limitations that have been or may be from time to time adopted by the board of directors and or finance committee of the board of directors

at february   the collateral balance held by our counterparties based on our total return swaps aggregate notional amount of million was million and was recorded as a current receivable on our consolidated balance sheet

operating activities and cash flows as a retailer  holdings primary source of operating cash flows is the sales of goods and services to customers  while the primary use of cash in operations is to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories 
holdings generated approximately billion in operating cash flows during fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase in net operating cash flows generated during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflects a cash inflow of million related to merchandise inventories in versus cash used of million in  offset by an increase in cash used for income and other taxes  as well as decreased net income 
during fiscal  holdings generated approximately billion in operating cash flows 
the lower level of net operating cash flows generated during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflected the impact of increased merchandise inventories  as well as reduced operating liabilities  partially offset by increased net income in merchandise inventories at february  were billion  as compared to billion as of february  domestic inventory levels declined from billion at february  to billion at february  despite the addition of approximately million of previously consigned pharmacy inventory 
the reduction in domestic inventory levels was offset by an increase in inventory levels at sears canada  largely due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
we continue to review and assess our merchandise inventory levels in an ongoing effort to continuously improve overall returns 
merchandise payables were billion at february   as compared to billion as of february  investing activities and cash flows net cash flows used by investing activities totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million used in fiscal and million provided in fiscal investing cash flows in all three years were heavily impacted by a number of significant transactions

there were no total return swaps outstanding as of february  in connection with the settlement of our investments in total return swaps during  collateral posted in the amount of million in was returned to us in we purchased million shares of common stock of restoration hardware  inc restoration  a specialty retailer of hardware  bathware  furniture  lighting  textiles  accessories and gifts during our investment of million represents an ownership interest of of restoration s total outstanding shares 
in addition  during fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures compared to million during the prior year 
capital expenditures during fiscal included multiple real estate acquisitions of space used for holdings retail locations or distribution centers and for continued investments in our information technology 
we anticipate fiscal capital expenditure levels to be flat to levels  however  it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during fiscal  we purchased previously leased operating properties for million 
fiscal investing activity cash flows reflect cash paid in connection with the acquisition of additional interest in sears canada 
we paid a total of million for additional common shares of sears canada  raising holdings ownership in sears canada to approximately as of february  from approximately as of fiscal year end this transaction is further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

financing activities and cash flows net cash used in financing activities was billion in fiscal as compared to billion used in the difference primarily reflects an increase in common share repurchases during the company repurchased billion  million and million of its common stock pursuant to our common share repurchase program in fiscal  and  respectively 
the common share repurchase program was initially announced in with a total authorization by our board of directors of up to billion 
during fiscal and fiscal  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional billion and billion of common stock  respectively  for a total authorization since inception of the program of billion

in addition to share repurchases  we made debt payments of million  net of new borrowings  during as compared to million in fiscal the difference in cash used to repay debt between and primarily reflects the generation of million of debt proceeds  net of approximately million in issuance costs  in connection with our entering into a five year  million senior secured term loan at our orchard supply hardware stores corporation osh subsidiary in december the proceeds of this borrowing were used by osh to pay holdings the remaining loan payable issued in connection with osh s recapitalization in november the senior secured term loan is non recourse to holdings 
in august  sears canada sold its headquarters office building and adjacent land in toronto  ontario for proceeds of million canadian  net of closing costs

approximately million of the revolving credit facility was drawn down at closing 
a portion of the proceeds was used by osh to fund a dividend to holdings that included million in cash  which was available to be used for holdings general corporate purposes 
uses and sources of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including common share repurchases  debt repayment and pension plan contributions 
we believe that these needs will be adequately funded by our operating cash flows  credit terms from vendors  current balances in cash and cash equivalents and  to the extent necessary  borrowings under our billion  five year credit agreement the credit agreement described below

we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the fiscal year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the fiscal year 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores on a staggered basis throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit retirement plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit retirement plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate s estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of experience losses in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associate service period and by recognizing the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five year period 
the sears domestic pension plans had no unrecognized experience gain or loss as of the date of the merger 
effective january   kmart s pension plans were frozen  and associates no longer earn additional benefits under the plans 
therefore  there are no assumptions related to future compensation costs relating to the kmart pension plans 
during the first quarter of  holdings announced that the sears domestic pension plan would be frozen effective january  accordingly  domestic associates have earned no additional benefits subsequent to december  benefits earned through december  will be paid out to eligible participants following retirement 
holdings actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
prior to the adoption of fin on february   we recorded tax contingencies based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 which requires a contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable for a loss to be recorded 
upon adoption of fin  holdings began recording unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in accordance with fin  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we record reserves in accordance with the provisions of fin a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations which revised sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on the accounting for transaction costs  restructuring costs as well as the initial recognition of contingent assets and liabilities assumed during a business combination 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are applied prospectively from the date of adoption  except for adjustments to a previously acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position balances occurring outside the measurement period  which are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the period of adjustment  rather than goodwill 
we have not yet assessed the impact this statement will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  for financial assets and liabilities  as well as nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on an annual or more frequently recurring basis 
in november  the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal although we continue to evaluate the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements  we do not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which changes the recognition and disclosure provisions and measurement date requirements for an employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the recognition and disclosure provisions require an employer to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position  recognize as a component of other comprehensive income oci  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  and disclose in the notes to financial statements certain additional information 
sfas no 
does not change the amounts recognized in the income statement as net periodic benefit cost 
as required by sfas no 
 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of the statement as of february   and accordingly recognized the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and provided the required additional disclosures 
the adoption of these provisions of sfas no 
did not have any material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
see note for further information regarding the impact of adopting sfas as required under the statement  we will adopt the measurement date requirements of sfas no 
effective fiscal under the measurement date requirements  an employer is required to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end 
we currently measure our plan assets and obligations as of december we will adopt the change in measurement date by re measuring plan assets and benefit obligations as of our fiscal year end in fiscal  pursuant to the transition requirements of sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of the measurement date requirements of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
gives companies the option of applying at specified election dates fair value accounting to certain financial instruments and other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
if a company chooses to record eligible items at fair value  the company must report unrealized gains and losses on those items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  although we continue to evaluate the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements  we do not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
before sfas no 
was issued  limited guidance existed for reporting noncontrolling interests and many companies reported such interest as a liability in its balance sheet under the heading minority interest 
sfas no 
requires companies to report noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries as a component of equity in the consolidated statement of financial position 
as a result  upon adoption of this statement  holdings will reclassify its noncontrolling interest in sears canada and osh which represents and of the subsidiaries ownership  respectively from its current classification within the long term liabilities section of holdings consolidated balance sheet to classification within the shareholders equity section 
see note for the amount of holdings noncontrolling interest in sears canada and osh reported as minority interest at february  and february  in june  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective february  the impact upon adoption was to decrease our beginning retained earnings by approximately million 
see note for further information regarding the impact of adopting fin fin prescribes that a company shall recognize the benefit associated with a previously unrecognized tax position when management determines the position has been effectively settled 
the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 in may in order to clarify that assessing whether a tax position has been effectively settled is a matter of judgment 
furthermore  the fasb noted that a tax position could be effectively settled prior to the completion of an examination or audit by a taxing authority 
fsp fin provides a set of conditions that must be evaluated when determining whether a tax position has been effectively settled 
we contemplated the provisions of fsp fin upon the initial adoption of fin cautionary statement regarding forward looking information certain statements made in this annual report on form k and in other public announcements by us contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include information concerning our future financial performance  business strategy  plans  goals and objectives 
statements preceded or followed by  or that otherwise include  the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  plan  forecast  is likely to  projected and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  may and could are generally forward looking in nature and not historical facts 
such statements include  but are not limited to  statements about the expected performance of various business initiatives and future financial and operating results 
such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of holdings management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and events to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
a detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements is included in part i  item a risk factors 
while we believe that our forecasts and assumptions are reasonable  we caution that actual results may differ materially 
we intend the forward looking statements to speak only as of the time made and do not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
these market risks arise from our derivative financial instruments and debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding and interest rate derivatives 
as of february   we had interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of million  nominal fair value and a weighted average remaining life of years 
all debt securities and interest rate derivative instruments are considered non trading 
as of february   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at february   which totaled approximately million  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
foreign currency risk as of february   we had a series of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding  totaling billion canadian notional value and with a weighted average remaining life of years  designed to hedge our net investment in sears canada against adverse changes in exchange rates 
the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts as of february  was negative million 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the level of the canadian exchange rate relative to the us dollar as of february   with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a loss in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million as of february  certain of our currency forward contracts require collateral be posted in the event our liability under such contracts reaches a predetermined threshold 
cash collateral posted under these contracts is recorded as part of our accounts receivable balance and totaled million as of february  counterparties we actively manage the risk of nonpayment by our derivative counterparties by limiting our exposure to individual counterparties based on credit ratings  value at risk and maturities 
the counterparties to these instruments are major financial institutions with credit ratings of single a or better 
in certain cases  counterparty risk is also managed through the use of collateral in the form of cash or us government securities
