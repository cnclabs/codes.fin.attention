at barnes aerospace  important kpis are customer orders and backlog  which are utilized to forecast how sales will develop over the next months and beyond 
in the manufacturing operations  management closely tracks quality measurements and on time delivery to its customers 
in the aftermarket operations  management measures quality and turnaround time of overhauled or repaired parts returned to the customers 
in barnes distribution  kpis include daily sales average  average order size  and fill rate  which is the percentage of order lines filled on the first pass from the distribution center assigned to the customer 
at barnes industrial  kpis include sales and orders per day  which together provide visibility on sales in the next days 
management tracks inventory turns and sales per employee to gauge efficiency  and measures on time delivery and the number of defective parts per million as means of evaluating quality and customer fulfillment

this was partially offset by increased expenditures in its overhaul and repair business in to increase production capacity in order to capitalize on the strength of current and expected future demand 

table of contents outlook sales in the commercial aerospace manufacturing business are expected to grow based on the strong commercial engine order backlog and barnes aerospace s participation in certain strategic engine programs 
management expects continued aftermarket sales growth based on the strength of the maintenance  repair and overhaul mro market reflecting industry fundamentals and long term maintenance and repair contracts 
continued sales growth is also expected in the spare parts manufacturing business primarily as a result of rsp driven demand

liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths 
management continues to focus on cash flow and working capital management  and anticipates that operating activities in will generate significant cash 
this operating cash flow may be supplemented with external borrowings to meet near term organic business expansion and the company s current financial commitments 
any future acquisitions are expected to be financed through internal cash  borrowings and equity  or a combination thereof 
the company regularly reviews its capital commitments and needs and the availability of financing through institutional sources and the capital markets 
the company expects to pursue opportunities to raise capital from time to time as it determines to be advisable based upon its capital needs  financing capabilities and market conditions 

table of contents cash flow in millions change change operating activities investing activities financing activities nm exchange rate effect increase decrease in cash nm nm not meaningful operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for the company  generating million in cash during compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow in is due primarily to higher operating performance  offset partially by a higher investment in working capital  primarily at barnes aerospace 
this investment is driven by barnes aerospace s organic sales growth as well as an investment in inventory in its overhaul and repair business on the expectation of current and future demand 
cash used by investing activities includes participation fee payments related to the aftermarket rsps of million in and million in both and these payments were funded mainly with cash held outside the us as of december   the company had a million liability for participation fees under the rsps which is included in accounts payable 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the aftermarket rsps 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the period

at december   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents  the majority of which are held outside the us since the repatriation of this cash to the us would have adverse tax consequences  the balances remain outside the us to fund future international growth investments  including capital expenditures  acquisitions and aftermarket rsp participation fees 
in  management anticipates that the rsp payments and borrowing repayments will be funded with cash generated outside the us the company maintains borrowing facilities with banks to supplement internal cash generation 
during  the company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement which extended the maturity date until september  increased the borrowing capacity of barnes group switzerland gmbh  decreased the borrowing spread  and amended various financial and restrictive covenants  including the removal of the consolidated net worth covenant 
at december   million was borrowed at an interest rate of under this borrowing facility 
additionally  the company had million in borrowings under short term bank credit lines at an interest rate of at december  at december   approximately of the company s borrowings are comprised of fixed rate debt 

table of contents borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the company s debt agreements 
the most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant in any agreement requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to ebitda  as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit agreement  of not more than times at december  the ratio requirement will decrease to times for fiscal quarters ending after september  the actual ratio at december  was times and would have allowed additional borrowings of million 
the company believes its credit facilities  coupled with cash generated from operations  are adequate for its anticipated future requirements 
recent distress in the credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability  especially among non investment grade credits  and increased volatility in the prices of securities 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult new financial environment  the company has determined that there has not been a significant impact on our financial position  operations  or liquidity in the company s domestic and foreign pension plans are invested in daily priced and readily liquid investments in equity and fixed income securities 
as discussed above  the company s strong cash flow and solid financial position enabled the refinancing of the million revolving credit agreement at lower borrowing spreads and reduced covenant restrictions in september while the extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  the company does not currently expect a significant impact to its liquidity  financial position or operations in the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets  the level of market interest rates and benefit obligations 
in  the increase in the fair value of pension plan assets exceeded the increase in the projected benefit obligations of the plans  which had a positive impact on the funded status of the plans 
as a result the company recorded a million non cash after tax increase in stockholders equity through other non owner changes to equity to record the current year adjustment for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under sfas no

table of contents other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
the company has periodically experienced inflation in raw material prices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier testing if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the second quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment in future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans  particularly with respect to integrating acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company pays participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program 
the recoverability of the intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
management updates revenue projections periodically  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and obtaining industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate an impairment of the intangible asset 
the company evaluates the remaining useful life of this asset to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the intangible asset is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company has not identified any impairment of these intangible assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents reorganization of businesses for non acquisition related reorganizations  the company records the cost of reorganization initiatives at the time the liability is incurred 
for reorganization initiatives in connection with acquisitions  the company records liabilities at the time that management has approved and committed to a reorganization plan 
such a plan identifies all significant actions to be taken and specifies an expected completion date that is within a reasonable period of time 
the liability includes those costs that can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates are subject to adjustments based upon actual costs incurred
