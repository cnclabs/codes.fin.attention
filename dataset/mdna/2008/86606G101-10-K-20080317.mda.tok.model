words such as expects  anticipates  believes  estimates and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would and could are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results may differ materially 
factors that might cause such a difference include changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships  demand for products and services  the degree of competition by traditional and non traditional competitors  changes in banking laws and regulations  changes in tax laws  the impact of technological advances  the outcomes of contingencies  trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans  and changes in the national and local economy 
description of business we are a billion community based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our two operating segments community banking and insurance 
our community bank  summit community bank  has a total of banking offices located in west virginia and virginia 
in addition  we also operate an insurance agency  summit insurance services  llc with an office in moorefield  west virginia which offers both commercial and personal lines of insurance 
during  we acquired the kelly agencies  two leesburg  virginia insurance agencies primarily specializing in group health  life and disability benefit plans and merged them into summit insurance services  llc 
although our business operates as two separate segments  the insurance segment is not a reportable segment as it is immaterial  and thus our financial information is presented on an aggregated basis 
summit financial group  inc employs approximately full time equivalent employees 
overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits 
business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
key items in we achieved record earnings from continuing operations in income from continuing operations totaled  or per diluted share  an increase of 
we settled the pending litigation related to our previous mortgage banking segment  which resulted in an after tax charge included in discontinued operations of million 
this allows us to now fully focus on our core banking business 
we completed the acquisition of the kelly agencies  two leesburg  virginia based insurance agencies  specializing primarily in group health  life  and disability benefit plans 
we entered into an agreement during to acquire greater atlantic financial corp  a million thrift headquartered in reston  virginia 
we plan to close the transaction at the end of first quarter our net interest margin continued to experience pressure  dropping to for  compared to for despite an overall decline in market rates  competitive forces have caused deposit rates to be less sensitive to reductions in market rates 
credit quality has declined as our nonperforming assets have increased from million at december  to million at december  
table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
a fair value is determined based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair value equals or exceeds the book value  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value 
during the third quarter of  we completed the required annual impairment test and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
we can not assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets  which include goodwill

a summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion 

table of contents net interest income the major component of our net earnings is net interest income  which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in volume  resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet s composition  fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds 
we seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components 
this is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions  while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  consolidated average balance sheet amounts  and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years  and are presented in table i 
table ii presents  for the periods indicated  the changes in consolidated interest income and expense attributable to a changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate and b changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior period volume 
changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
tables i and ii are presented on a consolidated basis 
the results would not vary significantly if presented on a continuing operations basis 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing a increase in and in these increases in net interest income are the result of substantial loan growth in the commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios in all three years  which more than offset the impact of higher funding costs 
total average earning assets increased to  at december  from  at december  total average interest bearing liabilities increased to  at december   compared to  at december  as identified in table ii  consolidated tax equivalent net interest income grew  and  during and  respectively 
our consolidated net interest margin was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our consolidated net interest margin decreased basis points in  driven by a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing funds while the increase on the yields on interest earning assets was only basis points 
our margin continues to be affected by our rapid loan growth in an extremely competitive environment 
despite an overall decline in market rates  competitive forces have caused deposit rates to be less sensitive to reductions in market rates 
unlike in prior years  in many cases  the marginal cost of raising retail time deposits was higher at some points during than wholesale time deposits 
if loan growth continues at levels similar to  this could cause continued margin contraction 
our consolidated net interest margin decreased basis points in  despite an increase of basis points on the yields on interest earning assets  which was more than offset by the basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
see tables i and ii for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our consolidated net interest income 
we anticipate modest growth in our net interest income to continue over the near term as the growth in the volume of interest earning assets will more than offset the expected continued downward pressure on our net interest margin 
we continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact 
see the market risk management section of item a for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us

table of contents nonperforming loans by type dollars in thousands commercial commercial real estate land development and construction residential real estate consumer total during  certain of our customers began experiencing difficulty making timely payments on their loans 
due to current declining economic conditions  borrowers have in many cases been unable to refinance their loans due to a range of factors including declining property values 
as a result  we have experienced higher delinquencies and nonperforming assets  particularly in our residential real estate loan portfolios and in commercial construction loans to residential real estate developers 
it is not known when the housing market will stabilize 
management expects that recent increasing trends in delinquencies and nonperforming assets will persist 
commercial nonperforming at december   eighty four percent of the balance of commercial nonperforming loans at is attributable to one loan secured by heavy equipment 
commercial real estate nonperforming two properties comprise of the balance of nonperforming commercial real estate loans at december  one credit with a balance of million is secured by a commercial office building located in charleston  west virginia  another relationship totalling million is secured by a motel and service station in west virginia s eastern panhandle 
land development and construction nonperforming all of the land development and construction nonperforming assets are related to residential development projects 
percent of these nonperforming loans is comprised of two credits 
one loan had a balance of million for construction of an apartment complex  which the borrower has subsequently sold the property and paid off the loan 
another loan with a balance of million is secured by a residential development subdivision in hardy county  west virginia 
residential real estate nonperforming nonperforming residential real estate loans increased significantly during as many borrowers have been unable to make their payments due to a range of factors stemming from current declining economic conditions 
all nonperforming loans are individually reviewed and adequate reserves are in place 
the majority of nonperforming loans are secured by real property with values supported by appraisals 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the loans of a single customer relationship  which still remains nonperforming at december  we are well collateralized with regard to this credit  and adequate reserves have been made 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impaired loans which are included in the above balances 
as a result of our internal loan review process  the ratio of internally classified loans to total loans increased from at december  to at december  our internal loan review process includes a watch list of loans that have been specifically identified through the use of various sources  including past due loan reports  previous internal and external loan evaluations  classified loans identified as part of regulatory agency loan reviews and reviews of new loans representative of current lending practices 
once this watch list is reviewed to ensure it is complete  we review the specific loans for collectibility  performance and collateral protection 
in addition  a grade is assigned to the individual loans utilizing internal grading criteria  which is somewhat similar to the criteria utilized by our subsidiary bank s primary regulatory agency 
the increase in internally classified loans at december  is primarily due to three customer relationships 
management downgraded these three relationships  as they fell outside of our internal lending policy guidelines 
included in the net balance of loans are nonaccrual loans amounting to  and  at december  and  respectively 
if these loans had been on accrual status throughout  the amount of interest income that we would have recognized would have been  the actual amount of interest income recognized in on these loans was  
table of contents we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
we conduct quarterly evaluations of our loan portfolio to determine its adequacy 
in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we conduct a two part evaluation 
first  we specifically identify loans that have weaknesses that have been identified  using the fair value of collateral method 
second  we stratify the loan portfolio into homogeneous loan pools  including commercial real estate  other commercial  residential real estate  autos  and others 
historical loss rates  as adjusted  are applied against the then outstanding balance of loans in each classification to estimate probable losses inherent in each segment of the portfolio 
historical loss rates are adjusted using potential risk factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience 
such risk factors considered are levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and term of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practice  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
in addition  we conduct comprehensive  ongoing reviews of our loan portfolio  which encompasses the identification of all potential problem credits to be included on an internally generated watch list 
the identification of loans for inclusion on the watch list of loans that have been specifically identified is facilitated through the use of various sources  including past due loan reports  previous internal and external loan evaluations  classified loans identified as part of regulatory agency loan reviews and reviews of new loans representative of current lending practices 
once this list is reviewed to ensure it is complete  we review the specific loans for collectibility  performance and collateral protection 
in addition  a grade is assigned to the individual loans utilizing internal grading criteria  which is somewhat similar to the criteria utilized by our subsidiary bank s primary regulatory agency 
based on the results of these reviews  specific reserves for potential losses are identified and the allowance for loan losses is adjusted appropriately through a provision for loan losses 
while there may be some loans or portions of loans identified as potential problem credits which are not specifically identified as either nonaccrual or accruing loans past due or more days  we consider them to be insignificant to the overall disclosure and are  therefore  not specifically quantified within this discussion 
in addition  we feel these additional loans do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which we reasonably expect will materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
also  these loans do not represent material credits about which we are aware of any information which would cause the borrowers to not comply with the loan repayment terms 
the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is established on a loan by loan and pool by pool basis 
the unallocated portion is for inherent losses that probably exist as of the evaluation date  but which have not been specifically identified by the processes used to establish the allocated portion due to inherent imprecision in the objective processes we utilize to identify probable and estimable losses 
this unallocated portion is subjective and requires judgment based on various qualitative factors in the loan portfolio and the market in which we operate 
the entire allowance for loan losses was allocated at december  at december  and  respectively  the unallocated portion of the allowance approximated  and  or and of the total allowance 
this unallocated portion of the allowance is considered necessary based on consideration of the known risk elements in certain pools of loans in the loan portfolio and our assessment of the economic environment in which we operate 
more specifically  while loan quality remains good  the subsidiary bank has typically experienced greater losses within certain homogeneous loan pools when our market area has experienced economic downturns or other significant negative factors or trends  such as increases in bankruptcies  unemployment rates or past due loans 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans  respectively  and is considered adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio

table of contents liquidity and capital resources bank liquidity liquidity reflects our ability to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  as well as provide for other transactional requirements 
liquidity is provided primarily by funds invested in cash and due from banks net of float and reserves  federal funds sold  non pledged securities  and available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank  which totaled approximately  or of total consolidated assets at december  our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity 
core deposits increased million in  while loans increased approximately million 
this caused us to rely on other wholesale funding vehicles  which included million of long term structured reverse repurchase agreements 
we used the funds to pay off brokered deposits and to fund growth 
as a member of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  we have access to approximately million 
as of december  and  these advances totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity of million through fhlb programs 
we also have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks using established federal funds purchased lines 
these available lines totaled million at december  during  we established a line with the federal reserve bank to be used as a contingency liquidity vehicle 
the amount available on this line at december  was approximately million 
also  we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises 
we continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day to day as well as anticipated funding needs are met 
we are not aware of any trends  commitments  events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity 
growth and expansion during  we continued our strategy to enter into business opportunities which earn noninterest income 
accordingly  we acquired the kelly agencies  two leesburg  virginia based insurance agencies  specializing primarily in group health  life and disability benefit plans 
we also continued our community bank branching strategy by entering into an agreement to purchase greater atlantic financial corp 
greater atlantic  a million thrift headquartered in reston  virginia 
the transaction is expected to close during first quarter after completing the acquisition  we will have total banking offices and plan to continue to expand in virginia and the eastern panhandle of west virginia 
our branching strategy is subject to availability of suitable sites  hiring qualified personnel  obtaining regulatory approval  having adequate capital  and other conditions and contingencies 
during  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures for premises and equipment 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in  primarily for building construction  furniture and equipment related to office openings 
actual expenditures may vary significantly from those expected  primarily depending on the number and cost of additional branch openings 
capital compliance our capital position has tightened as a result of our continued growth and the payment of the litigation settlement during fourth quarter discussed below

our risk weighted tier capital  total capital and leverage capital ratios approximated   and  respectively  at december   all of which are equal to or in excess of the minimum guidelines to be well capitalized under the regulatory prompt corrective action provisions 
our subsidiary bank is also subject to minimum capital ratios as further discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements we intend to issue million of subordinated debt in conjunction with the acquisition of greater atlantic which qualifies as tier capital 
this debt will have an interest rate of month libor plus basis points and will have a term of years 
we expect to remain well capitalized following the acquisition 
stock repurchases in august  our board of directors authorized the open market repurchase of up to  shares approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of our stock 
during  we repurchased  shares under this plan 
trust preferred securities at december   we had three outstanding issues of trust preferred securities totaling  under federal reserve board guidelines  we had the ability to issue an additional million of trust preferred securities as of december  that would qualify as tier regulatory capital to support our future growth 
trust preferred securities issuances in excess of this limit generally may be included in tier capital 

table of contents dividends cash dividends per share rose to in compared to in  representing dividend payout ratios of and for and  respectively 
it is our intention to continue to pay dividends on a similar schedule during future cash dividends will depend on the earnings and financial condition of our subsidiary bank as well as general economic conditions 
the primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary banks 
dividends paid by our subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions by banking regulations 
the most restrictive provision requires approval by the respective bank s regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank s current year s net income  as defined  plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years 
during  the net retained profits available for distribution to summit as dividends without regulatory approval are approximately  plus net income for the interim periods through the date of declaration 
legal contingencies we are involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of counsel  the outcome of these matters will not have a significant adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current litigation 
on december   two of our subsidiaries  summit financial  llc and shenandoah valley national bank  and various employees of summit financial  llc were served with a petition for temporary injunction and a bill of complaint filed in the circuit court of fairfax county  virginia by corinthian mortgage corporation 
the filings allege various claims against summit financial  llc and shenandoah valley national bank arising out of the hiring of former employees of corinthian mortgage corporation corinthian and the alleged use of its proprietary information 
the individual defendants have also been sued based on allegations arising out of their former employment relationship with corinthian and their employment with summit financial  llc

on december   we agreed to settle this litigation and ultimately elected to pay corinthian and other related interests the total sum of million 
million of this total amount was paid by our insurance carrier 
as a result of the settlement  we recognized a one time after tax charge in the fourth quarter of of million million pre tax  which is included in discontinued operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of embedded options 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is comprised of members of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the alco actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources  uses and prices of funds 
some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business 
our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   our interest rate risk position was relatively neutral in the short term zero to twelve months and moderately liability sensitive in the intermediate term thirteen to twenty four months 
that is  in the short term absent any changes in the volumes of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  assets are likely to reprice ratably as liabilities reprice  resulting in no significant changes in net interest income in a rising or falling rate environment 
over the intermediate term  liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets  resulting in a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment  while a falling interest rate environment would produce an increase in net interest income 
net interest income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flat yield curve results in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen 
several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk 
we primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
each increase or decrease in rates is assumed to gradually take place over a month period  and then remain stable 
assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns 
the following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates  as measured by our earnings simulation model as of december  the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates gradual change over months  stable thereafter compared to net interest income with rates unchanged 
the estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our alco policy limit  which is a reduction in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
change in interest rates estimated change in net interest income over basis points months months down down  steepening yield curve up up assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve assumes steepening curve whereby short term rates decline by basis points while long term rates decline by basis points
