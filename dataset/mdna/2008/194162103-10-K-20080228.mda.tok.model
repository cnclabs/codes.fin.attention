managing foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity price fluctuations 
volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of 
table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts techniques  including working capital management  selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions  issued with standard features  in accordance with the company s treasury and risk management policies 
the company s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of leveraged derivatives or derivatives for trading purposes 
as the company markets its products in over countries and territories  it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe  asia africa and certain latin american countries  although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures in these markets through a combination of cost containment measures  selling price increases and foreign currency hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements 
the company primarily utilizes currency forward contracts  cross currency interest rate swaps  local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases and assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
from time to time  the company hedges certain of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward contracts and currency options with durations no greater than months 
interest rate swaps and debt issuances are utilized to manage the company s targeted mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility 
the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production  such as resins  tallow  corn and soybeans 
futures and option contracts are used on a limited basis to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases 
in  the results of the company s commodity hedging activities were not material 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the financial instrument contracts held by the company  however  nonperformance by these counterparties is considered remote as it is the company s policy to contract with diversified counterparties that have a long term debt rating of aa aa or higher 
value at risk the company s risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate  foreign exchange and commodity price exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows  market value and sensitivity analysis 
however  the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate  foreign exchange and commodity based financial instruments  assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate  foreign exchange rate or commodity based instruments  calculated using the var model  is not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in and the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate  foreign exchange rate  or commodity based instruments  calculated utilizing the ear model  is not material to the company s results of operations in and actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as minority interest  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently evaluating sfas and does not expect it will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs had been included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percent of sales would have decreased by bps from to in and decreased bps and bps in and  respectively  with no impact on reported earnings 
the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method approximately of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method approximately of inventories 
there would have been no impact on reported earnings for  and had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  stock options  asset impairment  uncertain tax positions  tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for us plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
discount rates used for the us defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the us plans 
for the company s international plans  the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for us plans was as of december   and in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return 
the historical rate of return for the us plans for the most recent year period was 
in addition  the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately in fixed income securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term  in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term and in real estate and other which are expected to earn approximately in the long term 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would cumulatively impact future net income by approximately a third assumption is the long term rate of compensation  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was as of december   and refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s pension and other postretirement plans 
the most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate 
the assumed rate of increase is for  declining per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of per year 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately effective january   the company adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
the company uses the black 
table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards under sfas r 
the weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended december   was 
the black scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options 
these assumptions include expected term of options  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
while these assumptions do not require significant judgment  as the significant inputs are determined from independent third party sources  changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value 
a one year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 
a change in volatility would change fair value by approximately asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets 
asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the restructuring program requires management s best estimate of net realizable value 
the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction  carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 
legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
while it is possible that the company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the one time impact of the resolution of such contingencies  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  on going results of operations or cash flows 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s contingencies 
the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms 
while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates  there is a short time frame typically less than days between the shipment of product and cash receipt  thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company s significant accounting policies 
outlook looking forward into  while the company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive  it believes it is well positioned for continued growth 
in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share  the company anticipates continuing to prioritize investments in key categories and markets and increasing momentum against its strategic initiatives getting closer to the consumer  the profession and our customers  effectiveness and efficiency in everything  innovation everywhere  and leadership 
the restructuring program is designed to enhance the company s global leadership position in its core businesses 
as part of the restructuring program  the company is in the process of streamlining its global supply chain  reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales  marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets 
the savings and benefits from the restructuring program  along with the company s other on going cost savings and growth initiatives  are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 

table of contents dollars in millions except per share amounts however  as noted above  the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation 
in addition  changes in economic conditions  movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars 
in particular  economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions 
historically  the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries 
over the long term  the company s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names  its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets  and its strong capital base all position it to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value
