item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  the accounting policies  
table of contents estimates and assumptions described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products primarily eye care pharmaceuticals and skin care products to wholesalers within the united states  and we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at physician  hospital and clinic locations 
these customers are contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon the use of consigned inventory 
revenue for consigned inventory is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been used 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory  and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm the accuracy of customer reporting 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from most product lines by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets and for certain medical device products  primarily breast implants  provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and were million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other accrued expenses and trade receivables  net in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note  composition of certain financial statement captions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for sales returns at december  compared to december  and the increase in the provision for sales returns in and compared to the corresponding prior year were primarily due to growth in net sales of medical device products  primarily breast implants  which generally have a significantly higher rate of return than specialty pharmaceutical products 
historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been within the amounts reserved or accrued 
we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid and medicare 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses and trade receivables  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note  composition of certain financial statement captions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for sales rebates and other incentive programs during and compared to the corresponding prior year is primarily due to an increase in us specialty pharmaceutical sales  principally eye care pharmaceutical products  which are subject to such rebate and incentive programs 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products  which occurred for several of our products early in each of and  generally results in higher provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 

table of contents our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index urban cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated product net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated product net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
we recognize license fees  royalties and reimbursement income for services provided as other revenues based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a contractual agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after entering into the contract 
we defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our us pension plans account for a large majority of our aggregate pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our us funded pension plan for determining the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and our assumptions for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our non us funded pension plans were  and for  and  respectively 
for our us funded pension plan  we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plan s investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
for our non us funded pension plans  the expected rate of return was determined based on asset distribution and assumed long term rates of return on fixed income instruments and equities 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates of the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in our rate of return on assets assumptions for our us and us funded pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and non us pension benefit obligations at december  were and  respectively  and at december  were and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and us net periodic benefit costs 
table of contents for were and  respectively  for  and  respectively  and for  and  respectively 
we determine the discount rate largely based upon an index of high quality fixed income investments for our us plans  we use the us moody s aa corporate long bond index and for our non us plans  we use the iboxx corporate aa year index and the iboxx corporate aa year index and  for our us plans  a constructed hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates for the discount rates used to calculate our pension benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for future years 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption for our u 
s and non us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of share based payment awards is estimated at the grant date using an option pricing model  and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards and recognize shared based compensation cost over the vesting period using the straight line single option method 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation cost was recognized for awards to employees or directors if the exercise price of the award was equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  no compensation expense for stock option awards was recognized in the periods before january  income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions  research and development  or r d  tax credits available in the united states and other jurisdictions  and deductions available in the united states for domestic production activities 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the recognition or derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
reductions to valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards of acquired businesses will be treated as adjustments to purchased goodwill up through and until the end of our fiscal year 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
historically  our policy has been to account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  which considered whether the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position was probable of being sustained 
under fin  the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions may be 
table of contents recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  based solely on its technical merits  with the taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers only for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions as discrete tax adjustments in the first interim period that the more likely than not threshold is not met 
due to the inherent risks in the estimates and assumptions used in determining the sustainability of our tax positions and in the measurement of the related tax  our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may vary significantly from our estimates and from amounts reported in future or prior periods 
we discuss this change in accounting principle and its effect on our consolidated financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances  when they are recognized in the provision for income taxes  are included as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
the increase in the amount of valuation allowances at december  compared to december  is primarily due to our october acquisition of esprit pharma holding company  inc  or esprit  and our february acquisition of endoart sa  or endoart 
material differences in the estimated amount of valuation allowances may result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes if the actual amounts for valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets differ from the amounts we estimate 
reductions to valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards of acquired businesses will be treated as adjustments to purchased goodwill up through and until the end of our fiscal year 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in these foreign operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
income tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
we annually update our estimate of unremitted earnings outside the united states after the completion of each fiscal year 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
on october   we acquired esprit for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on february   we acquired endoart for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on january   we acquired groupe corn al laboratoires  or corn al  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on march   we completed the acquisition of inamed corporation  or inamed  for approximately billion  consisting of approximately billion in cash and  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately billion 
the purchase prices for the acquisitions were allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
we engaged an independent third party valuation firm to assist us in determining the estimated fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
fair value estimates for purchase price allocations may change during the allowable 
table of contents allocation period  which is currently up to one year from the acquisition dates  if additional information becomes available 
discontinued operations on july   we completed the sale of the ophthalmic surgical device business that we acquired as a part of the corn al acquisition in january  for net cash proceeds of million 
the net assets of the disposed business consisted of current assets of million  non current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million million net of tax associated with the sale 
the following amounts related to the ophthalmic surgical device business have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations through the date of disposition 
we did not account for our ophthalmic surgical device business as a separate legal entity 
therefore  the following selected financial data for the discontinued operations is presented for informational purposes only and does not necessarily reflect what the net sales or earnings would have been had the business operated as a stand alone entity 
the financial information for the discontinued operations includes allocations of certain expenses to the ophthalmic surgical device business 
these amounts have been allocated to the discontinued operations on the basis that is considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to  or the benefit obtained by  the ophthalmic surgical device business 
the following table sets forth selected financial data of our discontinued operations for there were no comparable amounts for or selected financial data for discontinued operations in millions net sales loss from discontinued operations before income taxes loss from discontinued operations continuing operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a multi specialty health care company focused on developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceuticals  biologics and medical devices that enable people to see more clearly  move more freely and express themselves more fully 
our diversified approach enables us to follow our research and development into new specialty areas where unmet needs are significant 
we discover  develop and commercialize specialty pharmaceutical  medical device and over the counter products for the ophthalmic  neurological  medical aesthetics  medical dermatological  breast aesthetics  obesity intervention  urological and other specialty markets in more than countries around the world 
we are a pioneer in specialty pharmaceutical research  targeting products and technologies related to specific disease areas such as glaucoma  retinal disease  chronic dry eye  psoriasis  acne  movement disorders  neuropathic pain and genitourinary diseases 
additionally  we are a leader in discovering  developing and marketing therapeutic and aesthetic biologic  pharmaceutical and medical device products  including saline and silicone gel filled breast implants  cosmetic injections  dermal fillers and obesity intervention products 
at december   we employed approximately  persons around the world 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of continuing operations through the first fiscal quarter of  we operated our business on the basis of a single reportable segment specialty pharmaceuticals 
due to the inamed acquisition  beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  we operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
the specialty pharmaceuticals segment produces a broad range of pharmaceutical products  including ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and chronic dry eye  botox for certain therapeutic and aesthetic indications  skin care products for acne  psoriasis and other prescription and over the counter dermatological 
table of contents products  and  beginning in the fourth quarter of  urologics products 
the medical devices segment produces a broad range of medical devices  including breast implants for augmentation  revision and reconstructive surgery  obesity intervention products  including the lap band system and the bib tm bioenterics intragastric balloon  and facial aesthetics products 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to coordinate the development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates our business segments and various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below in accordance with gaap 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported sales  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported sales 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due primarily to increases in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals and botox product lines 
the increase in medical devices product net sales reflects significant growth across all product lines 
the increase in medical devices product net sales in compared to was also positively impacted by the march inamed and january corn al business acquisitions 
we did not detect any significant impact on our sales during from declines in consumer spending in the united states or other major international markets 
eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  including strong sales growth from ganfort  our lumigan and timolol combination  which we launched in in certain european markets  an increase in product net sales of alphagan p  our most recent generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma that we launched in the united states in the first quarter of  an increase in sales of combigan tm in europe  latin america  asia  canada and  to a lesser degree  in the united states due to the initial us launch of combigan tm late in the fourth quarter of  an increase in sales of acular ls  our more recent non steroidal anti inflammatory  and growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh and optive tm  our artificial tear that was launched in the united states  europe  latin america  asia and australia during in addition  net sales of eye care pharmaceuticals benefited from an increase in net 
table of contents sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  and zymar  an ophthalmic anti infective product for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis  in compared to these increases in eye care pharmaceuticals sales were partially offset by lower sales of alphagan p due to a general decline in us wholesaler demand resulting from a decrease in promotion efforts 
we continue to believe that generic formulations of alphagan may have a negative effect on future net sales of our alphagan franchise 
we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales during was due to a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  and an overall net increase in the volume of product sold 
we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from seven percent to nine percent  effective february  we increased the published us list price for restasis by seven percent  lumigan by seven percent  alphagan p and alphagan p by eight percent  acular ls by nine percent  elestat by seven percent and zymar by seven percent 
this increase in prices had a positive net effect on our us sales for  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our specialty pharmaceutical products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our specialty pharmaceutical products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in demand in the united states and in international markets for both cosmetic and therapeutic use 
effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which may have had a positive effect on our us sales growth in  primarily related to sales of botox cosmetic 
in the united states  the actual net effect from the increase in price for sales of botox for therapeutic use is difficult to determine  primarily due to rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies 
international botox sales benefited from strong sales growth for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in europe  latin america and asia pacific 
based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of approximately compared to in  botox cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of approximately compared to we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  is currently over 
skin care sales  which are presently concentrated in the united states  decreased in compared to primarily due to lower sales of tazorac  principally due to the impact of a negative change in formulary positions at key managed cared plans from the end of  and lower sales of other physician dispensed creams  including md forte and prevage tm md  partially offset by an increase in sales of vivit tm  a new line of physician dispensed skin care products 
net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in we increased the published us list price for tazorac  zorac and avage by nine percent effective february  on january   we announced a strategic collaboration with clinique laboratories  llc to develop and market a new skin care line  which will be sold exclusively in physicians offices 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a collaboration with stiefel laboratories  inc to develop and market new products involving tazarotene for dermatological use worldwide  and to co promote tazorac in the united states 
in connection with our esprit acquisition in october  we established a new product line that is focused on the urologics market 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize sales of sanctura  esprit s twice a day anticholinergic for the treatment of over active bladder 
in january  we launched sanctura xr tm  our improved once daily treatment for over active bladder 
breast aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of silicone gel filled and saline filled breast implants and tissue expanders  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to strong sales growth in all of our principal geographic markets and the full year impact of the inamed acquisition in compared to only nine months of sales activity in the november us food and drug administration  or fda  and health canada  approvals of certain silicone gel 
table of contents filled breast implants for breast augmentation  revision or reconstructive surgery and the transition of the market from lower priced saline products to higher priced silicone products in north america had a positive effect on net sales in the united states and canada in compared to obesity intervention product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of devices used for minimally invasive long term treatments of obesity such as our lap band and lap band ap tm systems and bib tm system  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to strong sales growth across all of our principal geographic markets and the full year impact of the inamed acquisition in compared to only nine months of sales activity in net sales of obesity intervention products were also positively benefited in compared to by an approximately three percent increase in the published us list price for our lap band system effective july  and our introduction in the united states of a premium priced  next generation advanced performance ap band 
facial aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of hyaluronic acid based and collagen based dermal fillers used to correct facial wrinkles  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to strong sales growth in all of our principal geographic markets and the full year impact in of the corn al and inamed acquisitions 
our january launch of our fda approved hyaluronic acid based dermal fillers juv derm tm ultra and juv derm tm ultra plus had a positive effect on net sales in the united states in compared to the launch of these products in canada and australia also had a positive effect on net sales growth in compared to the increase in net sales was partially offset by a general decline in sales of collagen based dermal fillers due to our reduced promotion efforts associated with those products 
our acquisition of corn al in january  had a positive effect on our net sales of facial aesthetic products in europe and asia in compared to net sales of other medical devices were million in and consisted of sales of ophthalmic surgical devices under a manufacturing and supply agreement 
the manufacturing and supply agreement was entered into as part of the july sale of the former corn al ophthalmic surgical device business 
this agreement was substantially concluded in december foreign currency changes increased product net sales by million in compared to  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro  brazilian real  uk pound  australian dollar and the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
us sales as a percentage of total product net sales decreased by percentage points to in compared to us sales of in  due primarily to an increase in international specialty pharmaceutical product net sales as a percentage of total specialty pharmaceuticals net sales  partially offset by an increase in us sales of medical devices as a percentage of total medical devices net sales  primarily driven by growth in us sales of juv derm tm dermal fillers and a decrease in us skin care sales 
the increase in the international percentage of specialty pharmaceutical net sales was primarily due to growth in international product net sales of botox and eye care pharmaceuticals 
the million increase in product net sales in compared to primarily resulted from million of medical devices product net sales in following the inamed acquisition and an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due primarily to increases in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals and botox product lines  partially offset by a decrease in other specialty pharmaceuticals sales  primarily consisting of contract sales to amo that terminated as scheduled in june eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  an increase in sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  an increase in sales of combigan tm in europe  latin america and canada  an increase in new product sales of alphagan p  our recently introduced next generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma that was launched in the united states in the first quarter of  strong sales growth of zymar  a newer anti infective  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer non steroidal anti inflammatory 
this increase in eye care pharmaceuticals sales was 
table of contents partially offset by lower sales of alphagan p due to a general decline in us wholesaler demand and the negative effect of generic alphagan competition  a decrease in sales of acular  our older generation anti inflammatory  and lower sales of other glaucoma products 
we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales was due to a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  and an overall net increase in the volume of product sold 
we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from five percent to nine percent  effective january  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by five percent  restasis by seven percent  alphagan p by five percent  zymar by seven percent  and acular ls by nine percent 
this increase in prices had a positive net effect on our us sales for  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our specialty pharmaceutical products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our specialty pharmaceutical products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in demand in the united states and in international markets  excluding japan  for both cosmetic and therapeutic use 
effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which we believe had a positive effect on our us sales growth in  primarily related to sales of botox cosmetic 
in the united states  the actual net effect from the increase in price for sales of botox for therapeutic use is difficult to determine  primarily due to rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies 
international botox sales benefited from strong sales growth for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in europe  latin america and asia pacific outside japan 
this increase in international botox sales was partially offset by a million decrease in international sales of botox for therapeutic use in japan  where we adopted a third party license and distribution business model as a result of our long term agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  that commenced in september based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales increased by approximately and  respectively in compared to the growth rate in botox therapeutic net sales was negatively impacted in by the million reduction in net sales in japan in compared to due to our long term agreement with gsk

 the change in the fair value of the derivative is assumed to exactly equal the related change in the fair value of the notes  so there is no gain or loss reported in our consolidated statements of operations related to the interest rate hedge 
at december   we had a committed long term credit facility  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  an unused debt shelf registration statement that we may use for a new medium term note program and other issuances of debt securities  and various foreign bank facilities 
in may  we amended the termination date of our committed long term credit facility to may the termination date can be further extended from time to time upon our request and acceptance by the issuer of the facility for a period of one year from the last scheduled termination date for each request accepted 
the committed long term credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million 
the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in registered notes on a non revolving basis 
the debt shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the committed long term credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maximum leverage ratios

as of december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current expected obligations  working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our product net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as we deem appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was an increase of million  million and million in  and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for activities relating to interest rate and foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts
