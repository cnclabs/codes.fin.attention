although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that page 
table of contents those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
executive overview the table that follows sets out our revenue and profitability for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income net income we generate approximately of our revenue  and of our operating income  from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  we increased revenue by  led by our subsea projects up  subsea products up and rov up segments 
our subsea projects segment  which operates only in the gulf of mexico  continued to benefit from performing more hurricane damage related work  as we placed a new saturation diving system into service and chartered two vessels and a barge to augment our existing vessel fleet 
our subsea products segment revenue increased from sales of oceaneering intervention engineering specialty subsea products and umbilicals 
our rov segment increase was a result of an improvement in average revenue per day on hire and growth in days on hire for our expanded work class fleet 
the million consolidated net income we earned in was the highest in our history 
the million increase in results was attributable to higher profit contributions from our subsea products  rov and subsea projects segments  with each setting annual profit records 
the subsea products and rov improvements reflect our strategic focus on deepwater and subsea completion activity 
our subsea projects increase was due to demand increases for hurricane damage related projects 
in  we invested in the following major capital projects additions of work class rovs  including placed into service during the year  expenditures to increase capacity at our subsea products manufacturing facilities  purchase of norway based ifokus engineering as  a designer and manufacturer of specialty subsea products  completion of construction of a saturation diving system for our subsea projects segment to meet growing demand  and completion of upgrades of the dynamic positioning system of our vessel  the performer 
for  we expect the demand for our deepwater oilfield services and products will remain high 
we believe this will be driven by continued high crude oil prices  limited non opec supply growth  rapid reservoir depletion rates and increasing hydrocarbon demand 
we believe the trend for our customers to increasingly invest in deepwater projects will continue 
we expect our earnings to grow about over  led by increases in operating income in our subsea products and rov segments 
we believe that growth in our subsea products segment will be driven by a rise in the use of subsea completions 
historically  there has been a strong correlation between the number of annual subsea tree orders and the follow on orders for umbilicals and other subsea specialty products that we provide 
page 
table of contents according to industry data  there were less than subsea completion installations before and approximately  in the decade of the s 
it is currently projected that there will be that there will be approximately  subsea completion installations in the decade of the s 
according to publicly available information published by quest offshore resources  inc  the projected global market for subsea tree orders in will be over trees  down from trees in industry wide umbilical orders in are forecast to increase to around  miles  up over from approximately miles in quest attributes the expected rise in subsea umbilical orders  despite a lower subsea tree order forecast  to a carryover of demand for umbilicals for trees ordered in prior years  as umbilical orders are being placed closer to tree installation dates  and an anticipated increase in the average distance between subsea trees and the host platforms 
with our expanded steel tube and thermoplastic umbilical manufacturing capacities  we are well positioned to secure a share of this work 
we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility operation and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs are usually used to provide drill support services 
therefore  utilization of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rig use and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs in use rov days on hire in thousands rov utilization critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products and advanced technologies segments  and occasionally in our subsea projects segment  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate page 
table of contents of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets carrying values to forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets or quoted market prices 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
in  we recorded million of additional depreciation in our rov segment 
these provisions related to the retirement of four vehicles and obsolete rov components 
we charge the costs of repair and maintenance of property and equipment to operations as incurred  while we capitalize the costs of improvements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this staff position prohibits companies from recognizing planned major maintenance costs by accruing a liability over several reporting periods before the maintenance is performed the accrue in advance method 
we previously used the accrue in advance method for anticipated drydocking of our vessels 
this staff position was effective for us beginning january   and we have since charged drydocking expenses to the income statement as incurred 
there was no material effect on our financial statements from the change 
goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  with the purchase price being allocated to the net assets acquired based on their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test the goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units for impairment 
we estimate fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information 
loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review larger claims with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and requires disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under fin  the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position depends on the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we made an adjustment of million to reduce our retained earnings as of january  to record the effect of our adoption of this interpretation 
we account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes on our financial statements 
we charged million to income tax expense in for penalties and interest for uncertain tax positions  which brought our total liabilities for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions to million on our balance sheet at december  including penalties and interest  we have accrued a net total of million in the caption other long term liabilities on our balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits 
all additions or reductions to those liabilities affect our effective income tax rate in the periods of change 
page 
table of contents we do not believe that the total of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in  and  we recorded reductions of income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions related to certain tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
current income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
we currently have no valuation allowances 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded

liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which currently extends to january at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
we expect our operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service  for the foreseeable future 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in included expenditures for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet  the purchase of norway based ifokus engineering as ifokus  a designer and manufacturer of specialty subsea products  for million  vessel upgrades  the acquisition of a small inspection company in the united kingdom  and facility expansions in the united kingdom  norway  morgan city  la and houston 
our facility expansions in the united kingdom  norway and houston relate to our subsea products manufacturing operations  and our morgan city expansion supports our rov and subsea projects operations 
our capital expenditures during included million in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure to support our growing rov fleet size 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
we added rovs to our fleet and disposed of seven units during the year ended december   resulting in a total of systems in the fleet 
we have chartered the ocean intervention iii from another party for an initial term of three years  which began in may  with extension options for up to six additional years 
the ocean intervention iii is equipped with two of our work class rovs 
we obtained a one year contract for the vessel  with customer options for up to two additional one year periods  to work on shallow water hurricane damage related projects in the gulf of mexico 
we have received notice that the customer has declined to exercise the extension options  and we now plan to utilize the ocean intervention iii on deepwater projects after it has completed its current commitment 
we have also chartered the olympic intervention iv for an initial term of five years  which we anticipate will begin in the third quarter of the olympic intervention iv will be outfitted with two high specification work class rovs  and we anticipate using the vessel to perform subsea hardware installation and inspection  repair and maintenance projects  and to conduct well intervention services in the ultra deep waters of the gulf of mexico 
our capital expenditures during included million in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure 
in  we commenced improvements in our subsea products facilities  including the addition of equipment to increase manufacturing capacity at our umbilical plant in the uk page 
table of contents and our subsea valve facility in norway and purchased an oil tanker for possible future conversion to a mobile offshore production and storage system in the event we obtain a suitable contract 
we also began upgrades to a dynamically positioned vessel and began construction of a saturation diving system to meet demand in our subsea projects segment 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisition of grayloc for million and additions to our rov fleet to replace units we retired and to increase the number of units 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a million aggregate purchase price limitation 
under this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock through the year ended december   at a total cost of million 
we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since through december   we had reissued all of these shares as contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options under our incentive plans 
for a description of our incentive plans  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in december  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
at formation  medusa spar llc borrowed million  or approximately of its total capitalization  from a group of banks 
the balance of the bank loan at december  was million  and it requires scheduled quarterly payments through the bank loan is secured by minimum throughput guarantees by the other investors in medusa spar llc 
we expect the minimum throughput guarantees will generate sufficient revenue for medusa spar llc to repay the bank loan 
we are under no obligation to provide medusa spar llc or the banks with additional funds to repay the loan 
at december   medusa spar llc had million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet 
the majority of the cash flow generated by medusa spar llc will continue to be used to repay the bank loan until the loan is retired 
after that  the cash flow from medusa spar llc will be available for distribution to the equity holders 
we received million  million and million of cash distributions from medusa spar llc and recognized million  million and million of equity in the earnings of medusa spar llc in  and  respectively 
medusa spar llc is a variable interest entity under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as we are not the primary beneficiary of medusa spar llc  we are accounting for our investment in medusa spar llc using the equity method of accounting 
at december   our investment in medusa spar llc was million 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income  adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and noncash compensation under our restricted stock plans 
our million  million and million of cash provided from operating activities in  and  respectively  were net of increases of million  million and million  respectively  in accounts receivable and increases of million  million and million  respectively  in inventory and other current assets 
the increases in accounts receivable were due to increases in revenue in the fourth quarter of the respective year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year 
the increases in inventory and other current assets principally related to raw materials and rov parts 
the raw materials increases related to preparations for building goods in our subsea products segment  which experienced a revenue increase of in  and we anticipate continued revenue growth in the increases in rov parts inventory related to equipment waiting for assembly into rovs to be placed in service in the succeeding year and increases in parts to be used for servicing our growing rov fleet 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million to modernize and add additional units to our rov fleet  million to add capacity to our subsea products facilities  including our acquisition of ifokus for million 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million to modernize and add additional units to our rov fleet and million to add capacity to our subsea products facilities 
in  we used million in investing activities  including million related to business acquisitions  primarily grayloc  and million to modernize and add additional units and equipment to our rov business 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in cash flow from financing activities as proceeds from the sale of our common stock  primarily pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
in addition  in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of excess tax benefit realized from tax deductions in excess of financial statement expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenue and expense in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation has not had a material effect on our revenue or income from operations in the past three years  and no such effect is expected in the near future

these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths of  feet or more 
we added rovs in while disposing of seven units 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities 
page 
table of contents for each of and  our rov revenue increased over the respective prior year from improvements in average revenue per day on hire and growth in days on hire for our expanded work class fleet 
we grew our fleet size to at december  from at december  operating income increased by in over and in over the lower margin percentage for reflected million of additional depreciation in associated with the retirement of four older rovs and obsolete rov components 
we anticipate rov operating income to increase million to million in from a higher average fleet size and pricing 
we expect to add approximately rovs in  with most to be placed in service in the second half of the year 
our subsea products revenue for rose and operating income increased over on increased sales of our specialty subsea products and umbilicals 
our operating margin percentage increased to from from better pricing and improved manufacturing execution  including better throughput and resolution during of startup problems at our us umbilical manufacturing plant 
our subsea products revenue in was higher than in  while gross margin and operating income percentages significantly improved 
we achieved higher sales of umbilicals and of our specialty hardware  and segment operating income nearly quadrupled 
during the year  we resolved the mechanical problems we previously experienced at our panama city  fl umbilical facility and we processed higher volumes at all three of our umbilical manufacturing plants 
the increase in sales of specialty hardware came particularly from rov tooling and clamps 
the increase in clamp sales was primarily attributable to the full year of operations from our grayloc division  which we acquired at the end of june we anticipate our subsea products segment operating income will grow million to million in  driven by a continuation of a high level of subsea completion activity  which we expect will result in growth in our specialty hardware sales 
our subsea products backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  in  our subsea projects segment experienced higher revenue and operating income than from an increase in hurricane damage related projects 
our operating income rose by over on an increase in revenue of 
we continued to experience favorable pricing for and utilization of our vessel and diving assets 
additionally  during the year we added a saturation diving system  placed the performer back into service after its upgrade  and chartered and utilized two dynamically positioned vessels and a barge 
our margin percentages decreased due to the high third party cost content of the chartered assets 
in  our subsea projects segment had better results than due to work related to hurricane damage from hurricanes katrina and rita and an escalation in demand for installation projects and our inspection  maintenance and repair services on the deepwater infrastructure in the gulf of mexico 
annual operating income more than doubled as we continued to benefit from rate increases and high utilization for our seven vessels and our diving assets 
we anticipate our operating income for subsea projects to be about million to million less than in  based on our expectations of the completion of two large hurricane damage related contracts midway through  four scheduled vessel drydockings in  and lower demand for shallow water vessel and diving services as hurricane damage related projects near completion 
in  our inspection revenue and margins continued to increase  due to strong growth in all of the geographic areas we serve 
we continued to sell more value added services at improved pricing 
for  our inspection revenue increased and margins improved over this was attributable to our successes in providing more value added services  securing new contracts  and controlling our operating expenses 
our operating income grew by over 
we expect that our inspection segment operating income will improve in  due to increased activity and higher pricing 
our mobile offshore production systems three major units continued to work under the same contracts  until the termination of the contract for the san jacinto in july the decreases in margins in were the result of million of expenses incurred to move the ocean pensador from the us west coast to southeast asia in the fourth quarter of  and the anticipated decline in the dayrate of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
we moved the ocean pensador to better position it in the marketplace 
the vessel is now closer to several shipyards capable of modifying it for production or storage service  either for us or another owner should we sell it 
we anticipate our mobile offshore production systems operating income in will decline from as a result of a lower dayrate going into effect in mid may for the use of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract  and the end of the contract on the san jacinto in page 
table of contents advanced technologies 
the table that follows sets out revenue and profitability for this segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies segment s revenue and margins for increased from those of due to increased work for the us navy on submarine repair and maintenance and general engineering services 
our margins for decreased from those of  primarily due to the transfer of the performer to our subsea projects segment in april our revenue was higher than from demand for general engineering services 
we anticipate our advanced technologies operating income will be lower than due to the completion in september of an engineering services contract that had been ongoing for more than five years 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
a portion of our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock 
our unallocated expenses within operating income consist of those within gross margin plus general and administrative expenses related to corporate functions 
the table that follows sets out our unallocated expenses for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands gross margin expenses of revenue operating expenses of revenue our unallocated gross margin and operating expenses increased in  primarily due to higher compensation related to incentive plans as a result of record results and an escalation in information technology related costs to support our growth 
our unallocated gross margin and operating expenses increased in over  primarily due to compensation related to incentive plans as a result of record results and our higher stock price 
our unallocated operating expenses in and included million and million  respectively  related to post retirement benefits for our current chairman and former chief executive officer 
in november  we entered into an agreement with our chairman the chairman who was also then our chief executive officer 
that agreement was amended in pursuant to the amended agreement  the chairman relinquished his position as chief executive officer in may and began his post employment service period on december  the agreement provides for a specific service period ending no later than august   during which the chairman  acting as an independent contractor  has agreed to serve as nonexecutive chairman of our board of directors for so long as our board of directors desires that he shall continue to serve in that capacity 
the agreement provides the chairman with post employment benefits for ten years following his services to us 
the amendment included a lump sum cash buyout  paid in  of the chairman s entitlement to perquisites and administrative assistance during that ten year period expected to run from to 
as a result  we recorded million of associated expense in the fourth quarter of the agreement also provides for medical coverage on an after tax basis to the chairman  his spouse and children during his service with us and thereafter for their lives 
we are recognizing the net present value of the post employment benefits over the expected service period 
if the service period is terminated for any reason other than the chairman s refusal to continue serving  we will recognize all the previously unaccrued benefits in the period in which that termination occurs

during and  additional wells were connected to the facility  thereby raising throughput over the level 
in  we experienced a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from our investment in medusa spar llc due to lower production throughput at the spar  and we expect this trend to continue in if the operator of the producing wells is able to either start producing from other zones in the existing wells  which are anticipated to have higher flow rates than the currently producing zones  or connect more wells to the spar  the declining revenue trend would be reversed

the winches and rov umbilicals have been ordered for new rovs and for anticipated replacements due to normal wear and tear 
we have ordered the specialized steel tubes in advance  due to the current shortage of these specialized materials caused by a general worldwide increase in demand for steel  as the lead times between placing the order and delivery have become extended 
we have contracts to build umbilicals that will use approximately of the orders 
we also have other identified opportunities that could utilize these materials 
however  should we decide not to accept delivery of the steel tubes  we would incur cancellation charges of at least of the amount canceled

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting  or historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts in  and  respectively 
positive adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of various foreign currencies against the us dollar for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  negative adjustments reflect the effect of a strengthening dollar 
we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million in our consolidated income statements in  and  respectively  related to our foreign operations 
in  the majority of our foreign currency losses related to our uk operations 
some of our uk subsidiary s revenue is from us dollar denominated contracts 
if the us dollar weakens against the british pound sterling  we will incur currency losses for the period the related accounts receivable are outstanding
