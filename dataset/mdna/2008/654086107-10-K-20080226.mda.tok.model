table of contents rate proceeding

the order also included the authorization to pass all chicago hub revenues directly through to customers as a credit to nicor gas pga rider and the shifting of certain storage related costs from the pga rider to base rates 
in addition  rates were established using a year average for weather as opposed to the previous use of a year average

in march  the icc issued a rehearing order reducing the annual net rate increase to million from the million that had been approved in the earlier order 
the company estimates that because the revised order similarly shifts certain items between base rates and nicor gas pga rider  under normal weather conditions and demand as reflected in the rate case  the increase in annual net revenue decreased to million from the estimated million under the previous order

nicor enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale 
nicor enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized 
however  gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market  whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are accounted for at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change 
as a result  earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change  even when the underlying hedged value of the inventory is unchanged 
the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period
