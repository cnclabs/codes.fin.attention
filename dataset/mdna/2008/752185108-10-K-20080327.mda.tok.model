table of contents during the corporation also recognized  in total investment income  an increase of  from the  of investment income in the increase is attributable to growth in dividends and interest from portfolio companies

gemcor designs and sells automatic riveting machines to manufacturers of airframes  missile bodies  space system accessories  and other aerospace equipment

critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has identified two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the related unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the corporation has adopted the sba s valuation guidelines for sbics  which describe the policies and procedures used in valuing investments 
investments are valued in accordance with the corporation s established valuation policy and are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for investments 
the corporation analyzes and values each individual investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets 
table of contents prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors entered into by the portfolio company that the corporation utilizes to form a basis for its underlying value 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase in unrealized appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
certain investments of the corporation are structured to provide a deferred interest period when interest is not currently due 
rand sbic s interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also utilizes other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the company adopted the provisions of fin in the first quarter of fiscal see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impact of adopting the provisions of fin and the related disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on december   the fasb issued proposed fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
the corporation will be required to adopt the enhanced disclosure provisions of sfas in the first quarter of since its investments are recognized at fair value in its financial statements 
the corporation is in the process of evaluating sfas in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits companies to elect to follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities in an effort to mitigate volatility in earnings without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the 
table of contents standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the corporation is currently evaluating the impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows  if it elects to adopt the provisions of sfas no

therefore  the corporation will invest in a mixture of debenture and equity instruments  which will provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio 
the equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long term and may not necessarily generate current income in the form of dividends or interest

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  december  decrease decrease increase increase interest from portfolio companies interest from other investments dividend and other investment income other income total investment income interest from portfolio companies the portfolio interest income decrease can be attributed to the fact that five debenture instruments concentrix corporation concentrix  innov x systems  inc innov x  ramsco  ustec and synacor inc synacor that contributed to portfolio interest income for the year ended december  were either repaid or converted into equity instruments during the last six months of and throughout  thereby reducing portfolio interest income earned during the year ended december  this decrease is offset by the recognition of the adampluseve original issue discount oid income 
this portfolio company  adampluseve  paid off its debenture instrument early and therefore the remaining  in unamortized oid was accreted into income during the year ended december  oid is created when the corporation invests in a debenture instrument that has a warrant attached to the instrument 
this requires an allocation of a portion of the investment cost to the warrant and reduces the debt instrument by an equal amount in the form of a note discount or oid 
the note is then reported net of the discount and the discount is accreted into income over the life of the debenture instrument 
after reviewing the portfolio companies performance and the circumstances surrounding the investments  the corporation has ceased accruing interest income on the following investment instruments interest investment year that interest company rate cost accrual ceased g tec ustec wineisit 
com interest from other investments the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher yields on these cash balances

dividend and other investment income dividend income is comprised of distributions from limited liability companies llc s in which the corporation has invested
