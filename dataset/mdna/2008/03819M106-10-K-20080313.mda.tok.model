item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with applied energetics consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are included elsewhere herein 
overview applied energetics  inc applied energetics  we  us  or the company  is a developer and manufacturer of applied energy systems  primarily for military applications  utilizing our proprietary knowledge of high performance lasers  high voltage electronics  advanced adaptive optics and atmospheric and plasma energy interactions 
applied energetics applies these technologies to deliver innovative solutions to urgent military missions  including neutralizing improvised explosive devices ieds  neutralizing vehicle borne ieds ie car bombs  and non lethal methods for vehicle stopping  among other high priority missions of us and allied military forces 
additionally  applied energetics develops and manufactures high voltage and laser products for government and commercial customers for a range of applications 
applied energetics is the sole and exclusive developer of laser guided energy lge tm and laser induced plasma channel lipc tm technologies 
these revolutionary technologies can precisely transmit high voltage electrical charges by using a laser to create a conductive path in the atmosphere 
we are seeking to develop applications that can deliver tailored weapon and countermeasure effects to targets with laser accuracy  and with manageable lethality and affects to reduce the potential for inadvertent injury and collateral damage 
this technology has been in continued development since our inception in our counter ied customers have expressed a preference for versions of our counter ied technology designed for integration into existing combat rugged vehicles or other platforms supplied by the customer 
this approach avoids the difficulties of fielding a new complex and computerized vehicle into the extremely harsh radio frequency environment of modern combat operations where even the most robust communications links can be seriously degraded 
accordingly  in the third quarter of we elected to suspend our internal efforts in development of our own remotely operated vehicles which were initially designed to carry our counter ied systems 
as a result of continued advancement of our designs and technologies and the desire of our customer to utilize existing military vehicles to transport our product  we reevaluated certain inventory materials on hand and reduced the carrying value to lower of cost or market for inventory not technologically current or that was directly associated with our remotely controlled vehicle development 
this reevaluation resulted in a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of million in september applied energetics is also participating in the long term development of an innovative and proprietary technology in partnership with a major aerospace defense contractor under an exclusive supplier agreement 
the agreement provides for concept development  prototype fabrication and testing  and fabrication and delivery of operational hardware systems 
we expect a series of follow on orders as this technology is matured and readied for use 
this agreement covers three years with options to extend for seven more years and includes provisions allowing applied energetics to pursue non conflicting applications for the technology including our developed hardware and designs 
we have deferred recognizing revenue until the initial phase is concluded and accepted by the customer 
we estimate that our costs to complete will exceed customer funding by approximately million and have recognized the effect of these estimates with a loss provision accrual to cost of revenue 
in january  we consolidated the north star operations into applied energetics to more effectively utilize the shared workforce of the two operations 
as a result of this consolidation  for we have also collapsed the reporting segments of applied energetics and north star into one segment for financial reporting purposes since north star no longer meets the definition of a segment under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition  management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
significant estimates include revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  estimate to forecast loss on contracts under the completed contract method of accounting  the valuation of inventory  goodwill and other indefinite lived assets  estimate to forecast expected forfeiture rate on stock based compensation and stock based compensation expense 
revenue recognition revenue has been derived from ongoing contract work for systems development  effects testing and the design and development of demonstration systems and sub systems for our government customers as well as for the development of our counter ied technologies 
it is expected that continued work on effects testing  design and development of specific lge and lipc systems  advanced design and proof of principle on an existing contract  compact laser source development  high voltage source development  optics development and the upgrade of a transportable demonstrator will contribute to revenue in this work is expected to be generally performed under cost plus contracts with government customers 
revenue under long term government contracts is generally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
revenue  billable monthly  under cost plus fixed fee contracts is recorded as costs are incurred and includes estimated earned fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
costs include direct labor  direct materials  subcontractor costs and overhead 
general and administrative expenses allowable under the terms of the contracts are allocated per contract depending on its direct labor and material proportion to total direct labor and material of all contracts 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in earnings estimated during the course of work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts become known 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
the asset caption accounts receivable includes costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
such revenue is billable under the terms of the contracts at the end of the year  yet was not invoiced until the following year and is generally expected to be collected within one year 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
revenue for other products and services is recognized when such products and services are delivered or performed and  in connection with certain sales to certain customers  when the products and services are accepted  which is normally negotiated as part of the initial contract 
revenue from commercial  non governmental  customers is based on fixed price contracts where the sale is recognized upon acceptance of the product or performance of the service and when payment is probable under the completed contract method of accounting 
contract costs are accumulated in the same manner as inventory costs and are charged to operations as the related revenue from contract is recognized 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
inventories inventories include material  direct labor and related manufacturing overhead and are stated at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
due to the nature of our inventory  we analyze inventory on an item by item basis for obsolescence 
accordingly in the third quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of certain inventories connected to our counter ied remote vehicle development 
this resulted in a third quarter inventory write down to the lower of cost or market of million 
intangible assets we account for goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets based on the method of accounting prescribed by the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we tested goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment as of october  based on this analysis  we determined that the fair values of our goodwill and north star tradename intangible assets were below their carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for goodwill and  for north star tradename 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee  director and non employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas r 
under this method  sfas r is applied to stock based compensation made after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  such as unvested stock options  that were outstanding as of the date of adoption will be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption will be based on the grant date fair value for those awards 
the fair value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate expected stock price volatility based on the mean of the historical volatility of applied energetics  an industry index and a representative peer group 
we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates 
sfas r requires the estimation of forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment  which is recognized in the period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
we estimate expected life by analyzing the historical option exercise behavior of employees considering the effect of strike and market price on employee decision making and pertinent vesting schedules 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield for comparable periods 
we previously accounted for our employee stock option awards under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  including financial accounting standards board fasb fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions including stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion under the intrinsic value based method  compensation cost is the excess of the quoted market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
accordingly  compensation costs were recognized for employee stock option grants only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
the company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
results of operations our consolidated financial information for the years ending december   and is as follows revenue cost of revenue general and administrative selling and marketing research and development impairment of assets other expense income interest expense interest income other income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss revenue the million increase in revenue from to is primarily due to an increase in revenue from our lge project of million  which was partially offset by a decrease of million from our counter ied projects and a decrease in our non governmental projects of  the decrease in revenue from to of million is primarily attributable to the completion to our unit counter ied order in june the revenue produced from contracts on our lipc technology remained at a constant level in and during  under the completed contract method of accounting  we deferred the recognition of approximately  of revenue and costs related to the contracted development of new high voltage technologies 
it is anticipated that this revenue will be recognized in cost of revenue cost of revenue also increased from to  in line with our increased revenue  by million 
cost of revenue includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses and research and development costs in accordance with the terms of our contracts 
the amount of allowable expenses allocated to our contracted projects also decreased in and primarily as a result of lower activity and revenue 
the negative gross margin in was primarily due to million estimated loss accruals attributed to the contracted development of high voltage technologies and the increase in lower of cost or market reserve of million 
the decrease in cost of revenue of million in from and the decrease in gross margin in reflects the decrease in revenue and the completion of unit counter ied order  a charge of million on a lower of cost or market analysis of items in inventory in that are no longer on our active bills of material and a provision for loss on projects of approximately  general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from to by approximately  this increase consists of an increase in stock based compensation for stock based awards granted to directors and employees in the amount of million  an increase in salaries and accrued compensation in the amount of  and a decrease of million of applied overhead 
offsetting these increases were reductions in temporary help and consultants of  travel related expenses of  professional fees of  supplies of  and fringe and benefits costs of  the million increase in general and administrative expenses in from includes the recognition of non cash director and employee stock option compensation expense of approximately million as a result of our adoption of sfas r in  increases in personnel costs and temporary and contract labor costs of approximately million which is attributable to our high number of employees in compared to due to our need for temporary staffing to assist in short term projects  including the improvement of elements of our internal control  increased professional and director expenses of approximately  which also reflects increased legal costs  director compensation costs and the non cash expense of a warrant issued for services  increased recruiting and relocation costs of approximately  which includes approximately  associated with the move from albuquerque to tucson of the north star operations  terminations and resettlement costs of the north star employees  offset by an approximate  increased amount of general and administrative expenses allocated to cost of revenue  research and development and inventory 
at december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock awards  net of estimated forfeitures and approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures 
these costs are expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over periods of approximately two years for restricted stock awards and one year for unvested stock options 
we are mandated to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of section sox requirements for a review of the control over our financial reporting environment 
the expense related to sox compliance was approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were approximately  for a decrease of approximately  from  in  reflecting reduced salaries and travel costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately  in over as we continued to advance our marketing efforts and the addition of a staff member in research and development research and development expenses decreased approximately million during as compared to primarily due the redeployment of our technical staff to our funded projects in progress 
research and development costs increased approximately million in compared to due to our continued strategic decision to internally fund research and development 
during  we started new research and development initiative and we continued work on our on going research projects to expedite the advancement of our lge  lipc and counter ied technologies 
these strategic decisions are designed to advance and strengthen our intellectual property rights and progress technology development at a rate that is less dependent on contract funding 
as revenues declined in the burden of increased r d was increasingly borne by company internal funds 
also impacting the rise was the approximately million increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses allocated to research and development 
ongoing development of lge  lipc and counter ied technologies are expected to continue over the next several years 
the costs to complete and the estimated dates upon which our efforts will result in commercially viable products are uncertain due to changing requirements imposed upon us by our customer 
many aspects of our technologies are highly sensitive to ongoing military operations and are largely classified under specific dod guidelines and  consequently  cannot be disclosed publicly 
during the next year  we anticipate that we will have the ability to fund our research and development efforts from our available cash and any awarded contracts 
our short term research and development goals are to develop efficient and compact laser sources  novel high voltage electrical sources  efficient optical systems extend the range of our lge system and engineer the lge hardware to smaller and more rugged technologies 
impairment of intangible assets we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter 
in  due to a significant reduction in sales volume and negative cash flows  we revised the five year earnings forecast and projected cash flows for north star 
the projected cash flows were considered in determining the fair value of goodwill and unamortized intangible assets recorded at the acquisition and also in subsequent periods to assess for potential impairment 
due to the decline in projected cash flows in  the company performed assessments of the carrying value of north star s goodwill and tradename indefinite lived intangible assets 
this assessment consisted of estimating the asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the goodwill asset s fair value through the use of an average of the capitalization of gross revenues and goodwill revenue methods to value the revenue generated because the analyses are made independent of direct reference to the reporting unit s actual performance 
the north star tradename intangible asset s fair value was estimated through an analysis of the projected cash flow 
based on these analyses  we determined that the fair values of our goodwill and tradename intangible assets were below their carrying value and in the fourth quarter of recorded impairment charges of approximately million for goodwill and  for the north star tradename 
interest income and interest expense net interest income for was higher by approximately  from primarily because the funds provided from the august financing were invested in income producing investments for all of as compared to less than two months of net interest income increased approximately  in from the  net interest expense recognized in primarily due to the investment of proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in august as well as the continued investment of the cash received from the sale of series a preferred stock in and to our retirement of debt in november other income other income in primarily reflects  received from the sale of million principal amount note from easy gardner which we received in the merger with ushg and we recorded the book value of the note at zero at the time of the acquisition due to uncertainty as to its collectibility net loss our operations for the year ended december  resulted in a net loss of approximately million  an improvement of approximately million when compared to this improvement reflects reduction in research and development expenses of approximately million  a reduction of million from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized in and an increase of our net interest income of  offset by a decrease in our gross margin of  and an increase of general and administrative expenses of the net loss for the year ended december  increased million to approximately the increase in our net loss is primarily attributable to a limited amount of work performed under contracts  the million increase in general and administrative  the million increase in research and development as we continue to develop our lipc an lge technologies  the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge offset by the  increase in net interest income 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of securities available for sale 
effective december   we reclassified our million of securities available for sale as long term assets 
our cash position decreased during the year by approximately million 
in  we used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
this amount is comprised primarily of our net loss of approximately million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
offsetting these amounts were non cash stock option compensation expense of approximately million  provision for losses on projects of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  increases in accrued expenses  deposits and deferred rent of  and accounts payable of  also in  investment activities provided approximately  consisting of the sale of available for sale securities of million offset by purchases of approximately  of equipment 
during financing activities provided approximately  at december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
our cash position increased during by approximately million primarily as a result of million provided by financing activities and provided by investing activities  offset by million used in operating activities 
during  our operating activities primarily consisted of our net loss of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts payable of  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  the recognition in of noncash stock based compensation expense of million  goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million  depreciation and amortization of  and an increase in accrued expenses  deposits and deferred rent of  our investing activities in consisted of million was provided from the sale and purchase available for sale marketable securities  partially offset by equipment purchases of  cash provided by financing activities in  primarily from the proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants of million  as well as million proceeds from option exercises 
we anticipate that short term and long term funding needs will be provided from the cash flow from working on government contracts 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fulfill existing contracts and expected contracts in and into the transportable demonstrator contract and the other applied energetics contracts  that presently represent a major portion of our current activity  are on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
this means all work performed is done at our government approved rates  which include general and administrative costs  overhead  labor and materials  fees and profit 
these costs are accrued as incurred and billed monthly 
other contracts are at fixed prices which have commercial type gross margins associated with them 
at december   we had million of government sponsored and government secured student loan based investments 
these securities have auction rate characteristics 
the dutch auction process resets the applicable interest rates at prescribed calendar intervals and is intended to provide liquidity to the holders of auction rate securities by matching buyers and sellers in a market context  enabling the holders to gain immediate liquidity by selling such securities at par  or rolling over their investment 
if there is an imbalance between buyers and sellers  there is a risk of a failed auction 
subsequent to december   auctions relating to those types of auction rate securities we hold failed 
further  over the past few months  there had been an unprecedented number of auctions failures for other types of auction rate securities 
an auction failure is not a default 
as of december   our investments were carried at par value as we believe that the investments approximated fair value based upon comparable and similar successful auctions for similar student loan backed investments that occurred in december  january and february due to the current illiquidity in the market  we have reclassified these investments to long tem assets 
we do not currently intend to liquidate these investments at below par value or prior to a reset date 
however  systemic failure of future auction rate securities particularly for auctions of securities similar to those held by us may result in an extended period of illiquidity and may lead to a substantial impairment of our investments or the realization of significant future losses at the point of liquidation 
we will assess the fair value of these securities at the end of each quarter to determine whether an impairment charge may be required 
as market conditions continue to evolve we may take an impairment charge in the future  which may be meaningful 
backlog of orders at december   we had a backlog that is  work load remaining on signed contracts of approximately million to be completed within the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payment by period less than more than total year to years to years years capital leases operating leases purchase obligaions total included in the above table is the  total lease commitment for our principal office  manufacturing  storage  and primary research and development facility in tucson  az that was terminated when we purchased the facility in february not included in the above table are the dividends on our series a preferred stock that are approximately million in each year  assuming no conversion to common stock 
preferred stock dividend the series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
the series a preferred stock bears dividends at the rate of of the liquidation preference per share per annum  which accrues from the date of issuance  and is payable quarterly  when declared 
dividends are payable in i cash  ii shares of our common stock valued for such purpose at of the weighted average of the last sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable dividend payment date  provided that the issuance and or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an effective registration statement or iii any combination of the foregoing 
capital leases we rent office equipment under capital lease agreements with approximately  in monthly payments 
operating leases we generally operate in leased premises under operating leases that have options permitting renewals for additional periods 
in addition to minimum fixed rentals  the leases typically contain scheduled escalation clauses resulting in a deferred rent accrual at december  of approximately  we account for the escalation provision by straight line inclusion in the rent expense 
total rent expense on premises amounted to approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
we also have an operating lease on a vehicle in tucson which expires in in february we purchased our principal office  manufacturing  storage  and primary research and development facility in tucson  arizona for approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to a variety of risks  such as the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the recoverability of the carrying values of our long term assets 
we do not presently enter into any transactions involving derivative financial instruments for risk management or other purposes 
our available cash balances are invested on a short term basis and are not subject to significant risks associated with changes in interest rates  however  certain of our marketable securities are facing a temporary illiquidity as certain of the underlying auction markets have failed 
it is not known when the underlying auction markets will regain liquidity  if at all 
substantially all of our cash flows are derived from our operations within the united states and we are not subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates
