item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview the company was founded in and is one of the largest regional department store operators in terms of sales in the united states  offering a broad assortment of brand name fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
we currently operate stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  elder beerman  herberger s and younkers nameplates and  under the parisian nameplate  stores in the detroit  michigan area  encompassing a total of approximately million square feet 
the company had net sales of billion in effective march   we purchased all of the outstanding securities of two subsidiaries of saks that were solely related to the business of owning and operating retail department stores 
the stores are located in states in the midwest and upper great plains regions and operate under the names carson pirie scott  younkers  herberger s  boston store and bergner s 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid approximately billion in cash for carson s 
carson s stores encompass a total of approximately million square feet in mid size and metropolitan markets 
to finance the acquisition and the payoff of our previous revolving credit facility  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which provides for up to billion in borrowings  issued million in senior unsecured notes  and entered into a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on october   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with belk  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase assets in connection with four department stores  all operated under the parisian nameplate  and the rights to construct a new parisian store  which opened october  the purchase price was million in cash 
in addition  we agreed to assume specific liabilities and obligations of belk and its affiliates with respect to the acquired parisian stores 
the acquisition of these parisian stores was effective as of october  we achieved significant progress with the integration of bon ton and carson s operations in  completing scheduled phases of the systems integration and permitting a single management view of the consolidated operations 
operational areas integrated in principally included the remaining aspects of internationally sourced merchandise purchasing and information systems technical support 
we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
the department store industry continues to evolve in response to ongoing consolidation among merchandise vendors as well as the evolution of competitive retail formats mass merchandisers  national chain retailers  specialty retailers and online retailers 
our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive  and we foresee competitive pressures continuing in the future 
in addition  we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging in the near term 
as such  in we expect a comparable store sales decrease of one to two percent  with a gross margin rate consistent with results 
results of operations the following table summarizes changes in our selected operating indicators  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each year presented components may not add or subtract to totals because of rounding percent of net sales net sales other income costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of lease related interests income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income compared to we operate on a fiscal year  which is the or week period ending the saturday nearer january of the following calendar year 
consisted of weeks  while consisted of weeks 
comparability between the periods is also affected by the inclusion of five additional weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of  the prior year period includes carson s operations following the march  acquisition 
net sales net sales in increased to  million from  million in the total sales increase reflects the inclusion of the five additional weeks of sales from carson s in the first quarter of as well as sales at the acquired parisian stores  partially offset by a reduction for closed stores and the inclusion of an additional week of sales in the prior year  reflective of the fifty three week fiscal period 
the balance of sales in reflects a bon ton comparable store net sales decrease of and  for informational purposes only  a full year carson s comparable store net sales decrease of  which  in total  approximates million 
we believe that the comparable store net sales decline was the result of several factors including  among others a challenging macroeconomic environment  the result of a weak housing market  mortgage and credit market concerns and rising energy prices  which has pressured consumer spending 
unseasonable weather in our geographic regions in april  september  october and december  which negatively impacted apparel sales 
the elimination of the prior year liquidation of non go forward merchandise in bon ton stores 
the quantifiable impact of the liquidation sales in the prior year was approximately million in the home area alone 
we believe there were incremental sales generated in the prior year from increased customer traffic as a result of the liquidation event  the effect of which cannot be discretely quantified 
the best performing merchandise categories in the period were children s apparel  footwear and better sportswear included in women s apparel 
children s apparel benefited from increased inventory investment and the introduction of new vendors and licensed product 
sales increases in footwear were primarily the result of increased inventory investment and the expansion of certain vendors into additional stores 
better sportswear sales increased as customers responded favorably to our new and expanded offerings of private brand merchandise and key branded vendors 
the poorest performing categories in the period were home which includes furniture  moderate sportswear and coats both included in women s apparel 
the sales decrease in home was primarily due to the elimination of the prior year liquidation event  the impact of which was particularly significant in the second quarter of  and the concerns in the housing market 
sales in coats and moderate sportswear were adversely impacted by the unseasonable weather 
moderate sportswear was also affected by the decision made by certain of our key vendors to exit the moderate sportswear business  the company was unable to develop sufficient new resources to mitigate the sales volume erosion in we expect this sales trend in moderate sportswear to continue until such time that we introduce new resources in the fall of other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under the ccpa  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase in dollars was primarily due to the inclusion of thirteen weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared to eight weeks of carson s post acquisition operations in the first quarter of and increased revenues received under the ccpa  partially offset by the inclusion of an additional week of operations in the prior year 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars in were  million as compared to  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in gross margin dollars primarily reflects the reduced sales volume attributable to the comparable store sales decrease and a decrease in the gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage point to in the current year from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross margin rate reflects the inclusion of carson s sales and markdowns for the first five weeks of the current year  this historically clearance driven period with reduced margins was not included in the prior year period 
additionally  the gross margin rate was impacted by increased net markdowns in the third and fourth quarters of  the result of increased promotional activity in response to unseasonable weather conditions and the challenging macroeconomic environment 
sg a expense in was  million as compared to  million in  an increase of million 
the principal factors in the increase in sg a expense were the inclusion of five incremental weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of and increases in those costs affected by normal inflationary adjustments 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in integration expenses  increased efficiencies in operations in and the inclusion of an additional week of operations in the prior year 
the current year expense rate increased percentage point to 
depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests increased million  to million  in from million in  primarily the result of including thirteen weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as compared to eight weeks of carson s operations in the first quarter of as well as the increased expense associated with asset additions 
furthermore  in we recorded million of asset impairment charges related to the reduction in the estimated net realizable value of certain store properties and a reduction in the value of two private label brand names  as compared to million of charges in for an impaired store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software 
income from operations income from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the million increase is principally due to the net additional weeks of interest expense on debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of carson s compared to such interest expense in the prior year  partially offset by a prior year charge of million for the write off of fees associated with a bridge facility and the early extinguishment of previous debt 
income tax provision the income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of in as compared to in included in the prior year provision is an income tax benefit adjustment of million principally associated with a net reduction in income tax valuation allowances 
net income net income in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in compared to net sales net sales for increased to  million compared to  million in the prior year 
net sales include  million from carson s stores for the period march  through february  and the acquired parisian stores for the period october  through february  bon ton comparable store net sales for the fifty two week period ended january  decreased compared to the prior year fifty two week period 
we believe that the comparable store net sales decline was the result of several factors including  among others the introduction of a common merchandise assortment across all locations  which resulted in significant changes to the merchandise mix at the bon ton stores 
the implementation of a common marketing advertising calendar in the second half of  which resulted in less aggressive discounting in promotional activity at the bon ton stores 
this strategy negatively impacted sales while improving the gross margin rate 
events in the automobile industry  which affected sales trends in our markets in ohio  michigan and indiana 
unseasonably warm weather in december  which negatively affected apparel sales 
carson s sales are not included in the company s reported comparable store sales  therefore  the following is provided for informational purposes only for the period march  through january   carson s comparable store sales increased 
the best performing merchandise categories in were women s special size and misses outerwear both included in women s apparel  footwear  home and children s apparel 
sales for women s special size reflect increased inventory investment 
misses outerwear sales increased as a result of expanded offerings of updated branded product and aggressive marketing efforts 
footwear sales increased as customers responded favorably to our new and expanded offerings in branded casual footwear 
the performance in the home area in reflects approximately million of incremental sales due primarily to the liquidation of merchandise we no longer intend to carry 
children s apparel benefited from narrowed merchandise assortments  increased emphasis on stronger national brands and improved penetration of unique brands 
the poorest performing merchandise categories in were dresses included in women s apparel and accessories 
sales in dresses continue to trend downward  and we have reduced our inventory investment in this area 
sales decreases in accessories reflected a lack of clearance merchandise as compared to the prior year and warm weather in our markets during december other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under the ccpa  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared to million  or of net sales  in the increase was due to the addition of the carson s operations and  commencing in november  revenues received under the ccpa recorded in other income rather than sg a 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars in were  million as compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in gross margin dollars reflects the addition of the carson s stores and an increased gross margin rate  partially offset by reduced sales volume attributable to the comparable store sales decrease and to the four bon ton stores closed in january gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage point to in the current year from in the prior year 
the increase in the gross margin rate reflects a percentage point decrease  at cost  in the net markdown rate  the result of improved sales of regular priced goods and less aggressive discounting in our promotional activity  partially offset by increased distribution costs 
sg a expense in was  million as compared to million in  an increase of million 
the principal factors in the increase in sg a expense were the addition of the carson s stores and support costs  including the costs associated with the transition services agreement with saks  and integration expenses 
integration expenses approximated million in the current year expense rate decreased percentage point to due to the increased sales volume 
depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests increased million  to million  in from million in  primarily reflecting the addition of depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired carson s operations 
in addition  in we recorded million of asset impairment charges related to the reduction in the estimated net realizable value of a store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software  as compared to million of accelerated charges on software associated with our credit operation in income from operations income from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the million net increase is principally due to the increased debt required to fund the acquisition of carson s 
included in the expense are charges of million for the write off of fees associated with the company s previous credit agreement and million for fees associated with a bridge facility required in connection with the financing for the acquisition of carson s 
income tax provision the income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of in as compared to in included in the provision is an income tax benefit adjustment of million and approximately million in and  respectively  principally associated with a net reduction in income tax valuation allowances 
net income net income in was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes material measures of our liquidity and capital resources february  february  january  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization unused availability under lines of credit debt includes obligations under capital leases 
total capitalization includes shareholders equity  debt and obligations under capital leases 
subject to a minimum borrowing availability covenant of  and as of february   february  and january   respectively 
prior to march   our primary sources of working capital were cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on march   to finance the acquisition of carson s and the related payoff of our previous revolving credit facility  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that provides for up to billion in borrowings  issued million in senior unsecured notes and entered into a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
increases in working capital and the current ratio in  as compared to  largely reflect current year reductions in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
the decrease in debt to total capitalization reflects cash flow generated in utilized to reduce debt levels 
the increase in unused availability under lines of credit as compared to the prior year primarily reflects decreases in direct borrowings and standby letters of credit to support the importing of merchandise and as collateral for obligations related to general liability and workers compensation insurance 
increases in working capital  current ratio  debt to total capitalization and unused availability under lines of credit in  as compared to  principally reflect the addition of carson s operations and the increase in debt to fund the acquisition 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in  million in and million in the increase in net cash provided in primarily reflects decreases in merchandise inventories due to inventory management efforts in response to sales trends  partially offset by a reduction in net income 
the decrease in net cash provided in as compared to is principally due to the proceeds from the sale of the credit card operation 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in   million in and million in cash outflow in was primarily for capital expenditures relating to the opening of two new stores  expansions of three stores and the renovation and reconfiguration of several existing stores  as well as information system enhancements 
the increase in cash outflow in reflects the acquisition costs of carson s and the parisian stores as well as increased capital expenditures for the larger combined company 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  million in net cash used in primarily reflects payments made to reduce long term debt 
cash inflow reflects the increased borrowings to fund the acquisitions of carson s and parisian stores 
prior to march   our amended and restated revolving credit facility agreement the credit agreement provided a revolving line of credit of million 
in connection with the acquisition of carson s and the related financing arrangements  discussed below  the credit agreement was terminated and simultaneously replaced by a senior secured credit facility on march  there were no prepayment or early termination premiums or penalties in connection with the termination of the credit agreement 
all deferred financing costs as of march  associated with the credit agreement  which totaled million  were expensed immediately upon termination of the credit agreement 
on march   the bon ton department stores  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bon ton stores  inc  and certain of its subsidiaries  bank of america  na bank of america and certain other lenders entered into a loan and security agreement senior secured credit facility which provides for up to billion of revolver borrowings 
the senior secured credit facility includes a last in  first out revolving credit facility of up to million and a first in  last out revolving credit facility of up to million  and has a sub limit of million for the issuance of standby and documentary letters of credit 
all borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are limited by amounts available pursuant to a borrowing base calculation  which is based on percentages of eligible inventory  real estate and fixed assets  with a reduction for applicable reserves 
the senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by the bon ton stores  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the company  except for certain mortgaged real property 
as part of the senior secured credit facility  bank of america and the other lenders will make available certain swing line loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed million outstanding at any one time 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest at either i the prime rate established by bank of america  from time to time  plus the applicable margin the prime rate or ii the libor rate from time to time plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is determined based upon the excess availability under the senior secured credit facility 
the swing line loans bear interest at the same rate applicable to last in  first out prime rate loans 
we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders for unused commitments at a rate of to per annum  based upon the unused portion of the total commitment under the senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility expires march  financial covenants contained in the senior secured credit facility require that the minimum excess availability be greater than million at all times 
in addition  there are certain restrictions against the incurrence of additional indebtedness  pledge or sale of assets  payment of dividends and distributions  and other similar restrictions 
per the november  amendment of the senior secured credit facility  dividends paid may not exceed million over the life of the agreement million of which has been paid out  or million in any single year  and capital expenditures are limited to million per year  with a one year carryover of any prior year unused amount 
as of february   the company had borrowings of million  with million of borrowing availability before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability covenant of million and letter of credit commitments of million 
on march   the bon ton department stores  inc entered into an indenture the indenture with the bank of new york  as trustee  under which the bon ton department stores  inc issued million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due the notes 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the bon ton stores  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
the notes mature on march  the notes may not be redeemed prior to march   except that we may redeem up to of the notes prior to march  through the proceeds of an equity offering 
the interest rate of the notes is fixed at per year 
interest on the notes is payable on march and september of each year  beginning on september  the indenture includes covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries to  among other things  incur additional debt  pay dividends and make distributions  make certain investments  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  use assets as security in other transactions  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
on march   certain bankruptcy remote special purpose entities each an spe and  collectively  the spes that are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the bon ton stores  inc entered into loan agreements with bank of america  pursuant to which bank of america provided a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million the mortgage loan facility 
the mortgage loan facility has a term of ten years and is secured by mortgages on twenty three retail stores and one distribution center owned by the spes 
each spe entered into a lease with each of the bon ton stores  inc subsidiaries operating on such spe s properties 
a portion of the rental income received under these leases will be used to pay the debt service under the mortgage loan facility 
the mortgage loan facility requires level monthly payments of principal and interest based on an amortization period of twenty five years and the balance outstanding at the end of ten years will then become due and payable 
the interest rate for the mortgage loan facility is fixed at 
financial covenants contained in the mortgage loan facility require that the spes maintain certain financial thresholds  as defined in the agreements 
we used the net proceeds of the notes offering and mortgage loan facility  along with borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  to finance the acquisition of carson s  refinance our previous revolving credit agreement  and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions 
aside from planned capital expenditures  our primary cash requirements will be to service debt and finance working capital increases during peak selling seasons 
we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share on shares of class a common stock and common stock on may   august   october  and january  to shareholders of record as of april   july   october   and january   respectively

capital expenditures for  reduced by landlord contributions  are planned at approximately million 
included in these planned amounts are expenditures relating to the opening of two new stores  expansions of two stores and the renovation of an existing store as well as expenditures relating to information systems  with on going efforts to implement bon ton s advanced point of sale system in the carson s stores 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations  supplemented by borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry 
a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
we have not identified any probable circumstances that would likely impair our ability to meet our cash requirements or trigger a default or acceleration of payment of our debt

in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise up to twelve months in advance of expected delivery 
these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies  insurance reserves  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
prior to the carson s acquisition  we utilized the last in  first out lifo cost basis for all of our inventories 
in connection with the carson s acquisition  we evaluated the inventory costing for the acquired inventories and elected the first in  first out fifo cost basis for the majority of the acquired carson s locations 
as of february  and february   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a fifo cost basis and approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations yielded inventory increases in recent prior years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to a net realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are reflected as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
these allowances received from each vendor are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising or payroll costs that have been incurred and reflected in sg a expense 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent we do not believe recovery of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of income 
our net deferred tax assets were million and million at february  and february   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we considered whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  or a portion thereof  will be realized 
we considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
as a result  we concluded that a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
a total valuation allowance of million and million was recorded at february  and february   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
effective february   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

fin no 
prescribes a recognition and derecognition threshold and measurement element for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
accordingly  we establish reserves for certain tax positions that we believe are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by applicable taxing authorities 
however  interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
changes in our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at february  and february   respectively 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires the company to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions  if available 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  in we recorded million of asset impairment charges related to the reduction in the estimated net realizable value of certain store properties 
impairment losses of million  which included a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of a store property and a reduction in the value of duplicate information systems software resulting from the acquisition of carson s  were recorded in no impairment loss was recorded in goodwill and intangible assets our goodwill was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net intangible assets totaled million and million at february  and february   respectively 
our intangible assets at february  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests and the portion of private label brand names subject to amortization are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at february   lease related interests  customer lists and private label brand names had average remaining lives of fourteen years  eleven years and one year  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at february   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives as part of the purchase accounting for carson s 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices and or a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
we completed our review of the carrying value of goodwill for  and and determined there was no impairment 
as a result of our review of the carrying value of intangible assets for  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
no such charge was recorded in or insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a defined benefit pension plan  and assumed the liabilities of three supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan s assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
for the years ended february  and february   we utilized the citibank pension discount curve cpdc 
the cpdc is developed from a us treasury par curve that reflects the treasury coupon and strips market 
option adjusted spreads drawn from the double a corporate bond sector are layered in to develop a double a corporate par curve  from which the cpdc spot rates are developed 
the cpdc spot rates are applied to expected benefit payments  from which a single constant discount rate can then be developed 
we believe that utilizing the cpdc to develop the discount rate is preferable because the developed discount rate is based on the expected timing of benefit payments 
for the year ended january   the discount rate was based on the moody s long term aa corporate bond rate 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
our target pension plan asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income and real estate at february  and february  was  and  respectively 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate facilities  we enter into derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps are used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps are qualifying hedges and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
at february   we held two variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million each 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and the interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at february  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of our interest rate swaps  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
expected maturity date by year dollars in there thousands after total fair value debt fixed rate debt average fixed rate variable rate debt average variable rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate seasonality and inflation our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the back to school and holiday seasons 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by material inflationary adjustments in the future
