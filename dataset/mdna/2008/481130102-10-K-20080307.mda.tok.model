our publishing segment consists of the milwaukee journal sentinel  which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  and community newspapers and shoppers in two states

our other segment consists of a direct marketing services business and corporate expenses and eliminations 
over the past two years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have deteriorated significantly 
continuing weakness in automotive advertising driven primarily by the domestic automobile industry  reductions in retail and classified rop advertising due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet  circulation declines and online competition have negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
additionally  the recent housing market downturn has adversely impacted the newspaper industry  including real estate classified advertising as well as the home improvement  furniture and financial services advertising categories

retail advertising also decreased in compared to with weakness in a number of categories  including small to mid sized retailers  department stores  furniture furnishings  food and entertainment 
in an effort to offset the negative effect of advertising revenue decreases  our daily newspaper focused on expense controls and better aligning the size of its business with the changing dynamics of the newspaper industry

other long term liabilities consist primarily of obligations for syndicated contracts  a national advertising representative litigation settlement  our unrecognized tax benefits  a capital lease  deferred income and deferred compensation arrangements 
we lease office space  certain broadcasting facilities  distribution centers  buildings used for printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases 
some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses  as well as provisions for the payment of utilities  maintenance and taxes 
we have a purchase commitment with a newsprint supplier for our publishing businesses which runs through march  and totals million as of december  the commitment is based on market prices for quantities we determine will meet our newsprint requirements over the term of the contract

we have reasonably estimated that cash settlement for million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits will occur in less than one year  million will occur in three to five years and million will occur in more than five years 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenues or expenses 
we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and 
table of contents changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
we evaluate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets in and  respectively 
the annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
from time to time  the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   we recorded liabilities for our unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
we rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate before curtailment recognition would have lowered by million or raised by million  respectively  the plans expense and would have lowered the plans projected benefit obligations by million or raised by million  respectively  as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the postretirement benefit plans  we commissioned our actuarial firms to study our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
in addition  we used the moody s aa corporate bonds  as of the measurement dates  as another reference point to support our decision 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserve the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
we also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine postretirement benefit costs other than pension 
we provide our actuarial firm with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation 
these assumptions 
table of contents could have a significant effect on our obligation 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
new accounting standards on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
statement no 
r requires that an acquiring entity recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
statement no 
r will change the accounting treatment for acquisition costs  non controlling interests  contingent liabilities  in process research and development  restructuring costs  and income taxes 
in addition  it also requires a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
statement no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt statement no 
r in the first quarter of we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that were not previously allowed 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
we will adopt statement no 
in the first quarter of  the same date we will adopt statement no 
we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
statement no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under statement no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  statement no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas b  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of statement no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  in accordance with the new rule  we will adopt statement no 
for all nonfinancial assets and non financial liabilities in the first quarter of we do not believe the effect of adopting statement no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation 
we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity  cost containment programs and  where the competitive environment permits  increased selling prices 
however  changes in newsprint prices could have an adverse impact on costs  which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
the interest rate on our revolving credit facility is either at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
average interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility were in if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
we currently purchase our newsprint from two suppliers 
our pricing agreement with a supplier ends on march  and we expect to enter into a new agreement 
we pay market prices for quantities we determine will meet our requirements 
price fluctuations for newsprint can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the average net price per ton was in based on the consumption of newsprint in for the milwaukee journal sentinel and by our community newspapers and shoppers  a per ton increase or decrease in the price of newsprint would increase or decrease our total cost of newsprint by million 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to newsprint price risk
