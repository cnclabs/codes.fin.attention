item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer  distributor and marketer of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
as part of our efforts to grow our business  as well as to achieve increased production and distribution efficiencies  in june we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of dana corporation s engine management group dem for million 
we place significant emphasis on improving our financial performance by achieving operating efficiencies and improving asset utilization  while maintaining product quality and high customer order fill rates 
we intend to continue to improve our operating efficiency and cost position by focusing on company wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction programs  such as closing excess facilities and consolidating redundant functions 
in that regard  during and  we announced initiatives to close our puerto rico manufacturing facility  integrate operations in mexico  close our fort worth  texas production facility and shutdown our manufacturing operations in long island city  new york 
for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  see item  business 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered longer payment terms 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
we accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
despite the additional controls  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced significant overstock returns as customers reduced their working capital levels in response to a difficult economic climate 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  which are our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete air conditioning system repair was performed 
discounts  allowances and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
consolidated net sales for were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in  driven by decreases in our engine management  temperature control and european segments of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in engine management sales was mainly due to higher sales deductions consisting primarily of customer warranty and overstock returns and other rebates and allowances 
the net sales decrease in our temperature control segment was due primarily to lower pricing and volume erosion caused by low cost foreign imports  partially offset by lower customer warranty returns 
europe net sales in included million related to the european temperature control business that was divested in december excluding this divested business  europe sales increased million 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased by percentage points to in from in mainly due to margin improvements in our engine management and european segments of percentage point and percentage points  respectively  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in our temperature control margin 
the margins in engine management and europe benefited mainly from continued improvements in procurement and lower manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting these savings in engine management were the impact of million of higher sales deductions for the year that negatively impacted gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the european segment also benefited from the divestiture of its temperature control business which carried lower margins 
the decrease in temperature control margin was primarily affected by selective price decreases to match offshore price competition 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million or of consolidated net sales in  as compared to million or of consolidated net sales in the increase was due to a higher bad debt provision on certain accounts receivable and slightly higher general and administrative expenses  partially offset by a reduction in distribution expenses 
restructuring and integration expenses 
restructuring expenses  which include restructuring and integration expenses  increased to million in  compared to million in the expense related to charges made for the closure of our puerto rico production operations  the integration of operations in mexico  the closure of our fort worth  texas production facility and severance and related costs in connection with the shutdown of our long island city manufacturing operations 
in december  we reached an agreement with the union representing the hourly employees at our long island city manufacturing facility relating to the shutdown of our manufacturing operations 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to the payment of certain severance payments upon termination of employment and to the withdrawal from the union s multi employer pension plan 
the estimated withdrawal liability related to the multi employer plan is calculated at million paid quarterly over years 
the present value of the liability is estimated at million and was recorded as part of restructuring and integration expenses in in addition  a million increase in our environmental reserve was recorded in for remediation related to the planned sale of our long island city building 
restructuring and integration expense in related mostly to severance costs related to the move of our european and puerto rican production operations and the divestiture of a production unit of our temperature control segment 
operating income 
operating income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to lower consolidated net sales  as well as higher restructuring and integration expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in  which was million higher than other expense  net of million in other income  net in includes a million gain on the sale of our fort worth  texas manufacturing facility  a million gain in foreign exchange  and million in dividend and interest income 
other income expense  net in included a million loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business 
offsetting the loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business are a million gain in foreign exchange  million in joint venture equity income and million in dividend and interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense of million in was million lower than interest expense of million in the lower interest expense in was due primarily to lower borrowing costs and lower average borrowings during the year 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million for compared to million in the million decrease was primarily due to a lower effective rate in  which was compared to in the rate was lower due to the release of the valuation allowance related to us capital losses in consideration of the expected capital gain in connection with our sale of our long island city  new york facility 
the rate was higher due to the adverse impact of discrete items attributable to changes in state tax rates  while the estimated tax rate benefited from pre tax income in europe where previously unrecognized losses carried forward offset taxes otherwise payable 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million and are net of a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
we have concluded that our current level of valuation allowance of million continues to be appropriate  as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
earnings loss from discontinued operation 
earnings loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  reflects legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability and adjustments thereto based on the information contained in the august actuarial study and all other available information considered by us 
we recorded million as a loss and million as income  both net of tax  from discontinued operation for and  respectively 
the loss for reflects a million pre tax adjustment to increase our indemnity liability in line with the august actuarial study  as well as legal fees incurred in litigation  whereas the income for reflects a million pre tax adjustment to reduce our indemnity liability in line with the august actuarial study  partially offset by legal fees incurred in litigation in as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
consolidated net sales for were million  a decrease of million or  compared to million in the net sales decrease was primarily due to our temperature control net sales decreasing by million or due to reduced demand resulting from a cooler summer than the prior year and competition from low cost foreign imports 
engine management net sales also decreased by million or mainly due to higher than average customer returns 
partially offsetting the decrease  net sales in europe increased million 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased by percentage points to in from in mainly driven by engine management margin improvements of percentage points 
the margin increase in our engine management segment reflected a combination of price increases and improved procurement and manufacturing costs 
temperature control and europe margin percentages remained stable due to improved production and procurement costs offsetting the effect of inflation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million or of consolidated net sales in  compared to million or of consolidated net sales in the increase in sg a expenses was driven mainly by increases in marketing and general and administrative expenses  partially offset by a reduction of million in draft expenses as we terminated our accounts receivable draft program in the fourth quarter of and a reduction in distribution costs as a result of lower sales 
the increase in marketing expenses is due to an increase in promotion spending and temporary overlapping costs as we transitioned from an outsourced to an internal returns processing center 
the increase in general administrative expenses was mainly due to our ongoing efforts to fully integrate our operations into a common enterprise resource planning system 
restructuring and integration expenses 
restructuring expenses  which include restructuring and integration expenses  decreased to million for  compared to million in the expenses related mostly to severance costs related to the move of our european and puerto rican production operations and the divestiture of a production unit of our temperature control segment 
expenses in were primarily for a non cash asset impairment charge of million in our temperature control business related to a strategic decision to outsource products previously manufactured  while the remainder was mostly related to the dem restructuring  which has since been substantially completed 
operating income expense  net 
operating income increased by million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from engine management s point improvement in gross profit percentage  lower integration expenses and the elimination of the accounts receivable draft program fees  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased million in compared to  due to a million loss incurred on the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business  partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains 
a benefit in was from a discount of million on a debt reduction not repeated in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million for compared to due to higher average borrowings and higher borrowing costs 
the increase in average borrowings is due to the termination of our accounts receivable draft program in the fourth quarter of  as well as the funding of the repurchase of our common stock held by dana for million at that time 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to higher pre tax earnings and a higher effective rate for which was 
we had an increase in our on going tax rate primarily due to the january  expiration of section of the internal revenue code with regard to our puerto rico operations which are taxed at the us statutory rate starting in this increase was offset in by the one time impact of our puerto rico deferred tax assets becoming recoverable at the higher us tax rate 
our taxes were also higher as a result of recording a valuation allowance for the capital loss on disposition of our european temperature control business which is not expected to be recoverable in the future 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million and are net of a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the tax expense of million in on losses of million was mostly due to the recording of discrete items  namely with regards to a reduced statutory rate applicable to opening deferred tax assets and a larger increase to the tax valuation allowance 
earnings loss from discontinued operation 
earnings loss from discontinued operation  net of tax  reflects legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability and adjustments thereto based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us 
we recorded million as income and million as a loss  both net of tax  from discontinued operation for and  respectively 
the income for includes a million pre tax adjustment to reduce our indemnity liability in line with our most recent actuarial valuation report  partially offset by legal fees incurred in litigation  whereas the loss for reflects only legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during  cash used by operations amounted to million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in the million decrease in operating cash flow is primarily due to an increase in inventories in order to bridge our requirements while we proceed with our facility integration efforts  an increase in accounts receivable reflecting an expansion in days sales outstanding from to  and lower net earnings 
during  cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to cash used by operations of million in the year over year improvement of million is primarily attributable to a lower increase in accounts receivable of million and increased net earnings 
the greater increase in accounts receivable in was due to the end of the accounts receivable draft program in compared to when our major accounts were under the draft program 
the lower increase in accounts receivable in reflects a stabilized situation with no draft program in place 
partially offsetting these improvements was a slight increase in inventory compared to a decrease of million in  driven by our need to provide a bridge of inventory as we undergo a rationalization of our production facilities 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of million in and the acquisition in december of a european wire and cable business for million  offset in part by proceeds of million from the sale of our fort worth  texas manufacturing facility 
during  we received million in proceeds from the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of a majority portion of our european temperature control business in financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the increase is primarily due to higher borrowings  an increase in cash overdrafts  and proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by a million purchase of treasury stock  essentially completing our share buyback program 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the change is primarily due to repayments made on our line of credit in due to an improvement in cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in our bank overdraft balances 
the increase to our line of credit was driven by the settlement of the note held by dana and the repurchase of the common stock held by dana  which note and common stock were originally issued to dana in connection with our acquisition of dana s engine management business 
in march  we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
this restated credit agreement replaces our prior credit facility with general electric capital corporation  which prior credit facility provided for a million credit facility and which was to expire in the restated credit agreement provides for a line of credit of up to million inclusive of the canadian term loan described below and expires in the restated credit agreement also provides a million accordion feature  which would allow us to expand the facility 
direct borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest at the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  or floating at the index rate plus the applicable margin  at our option 
the interest rate may vary depending upon our borrowing availability 
the restated credit agreement is guaranteed by our same subsidiaries and secured by our same assets as the prior million credit facility 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of certain of our subsidiaries 
after taking into account outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement  there was an additional million available for us to borrow pursuant to the formula at december  at december   the interest rate on our restated credit agreement was  and at december   the interest rate on our prior credit agreement was 
outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement inclusive of the canadian term loan described below  which are classified as current liabilities  were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at any time our borrowing availability in the aggregate is less than million and until such time that we have maintained an average borrowing availability in the aggregate of million or greater for a continuous period of days  the terms of our restated credit agreement provide for  among other provisions  financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months  and to limit capital expenditure levels 
as of december   we were not subject to these covenants 
availability under our restated credit agreement is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets 
in addition  the restated credit agreement provides that  beginning on january  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  million of our borrowing availability shall be reserved for the repayment  repurchase or redemption  as the case may be  of the aggregate outstanding amount of our convertible debentures 
our restated credit agreement also permits dividends and distributions by us provided specific conditions are met 
our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to the sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our near term needs 
in march  we amended our credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders 
this credit agreement amends our existing million credit agreement which was to expire in the amended credit agreement provides for a line of credit of up to million  of which million is currently outstanding and which amount is part of the million available for borrowing under our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation described above 
the amended credit agreement is guaranteed and secured by us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and expires in direct borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at the same rate as our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation described above 
our european subsidiary has revolving credit facilities which  at december   provide for a line of credit up to million 
the amount of short term bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities was million on december  and million on december  the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings on december  and december  was and  respectively 
in june  we borrowed million under a mortgage loan agreement 
the loan was payable in equal monthly installments 
the loan had interest at a fixed rate of maturing in july the mortgage loan was secured by our long island city property 
on march   in connection with the closing of the sale of our long island city property the mortgage loan was defeased 
for further information on the sale of the building and the defeasance of the mortgage loan  see notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that matured in october under this agreement  we received a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and paid a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
we have not entered into a new swap agreement to replace this agreement 
in july  we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures carry an interest rate of  payable semi annually 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  in august  our board of directors authorized a million increase in our stock repurchase program 
the program is in addition to our existing program authorizing million of stock repurchases 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock  essentially completing the entire million repurchase program 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased in the comparable period

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
we utilize cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire generally either in outright purchases or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales the used core exchanged at the time it is eventually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or recovery  respectively  within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of the adequacy of our valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions  we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  we recognize in our financial statements only those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
we establish tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold 
interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
with respect to goodwill  we test for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
in the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets  we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement and post retirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are the eligibility criteria of participants  the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
under sfas staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we have concluded that our post retirement plan is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit and accordingly we recognize subsidies from the federal government in the measurement of the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation pursuant to the requirements of sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
in september  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  we recognized a curtailment gain of million for our post retirement plan related to changes made to our plan  namely reducing the number of participants eligible for our plan by making all active participants hired after no longer eligible 
environmental reserves 
we are subject to various us federal and state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain environmental remediation efforts 
we estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and remediation costs 
such estimates may or may not include potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures  which may extend over several years 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our most recent actuarial study as of august  estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from million to million for the period through as a result  in an incremental million provision in our discontinued operation was added to the asbestos accrual increasing the reserve to approximately million as of that date 
based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us  we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  according to the updated study  legal costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings loss from discontinued operation  are estimated to range from million to million during the same period 
we plan to perform an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will continue to reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
other loss reserves 
we have other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb issued sfas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  as a result  was effective for us beginning january  on january   we adopted the provisions of fin the cumulative effect of adoption was a million reduction of retained earnings 
at january   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million  all of which would impact the effective tax rate  if recognized 
we continue the practice of recognizing interest and penalties associated with income tax matters as components of the provision for income taxes 
our accrual for interest and penalties was million upon adoption of fin and at december  we are subject to taxation in the us and various state  local and foreign jurisdictions 
we remain subject to examination by us federal  state  local and foreign tax authorities for tax year as well as through with a few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state  local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for the tax year and for tax years prior to we do not presently anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease prior to december   however  actual developments in this area could differ from those currently expected 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the fiscal year beginning after november   which for us is the year ending december  in december  the fasb issued fsp fas b to defer sfas s effective date for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis  until years beginning after november  derivatives measured at fair value under fas were not deferred under fsp fas b 
we are assessing the impact  if any  which the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  and the hong kong dollar 
as of december   our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that matured in october if  at any time  the swap was determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreement  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective would have been recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
the hedge was effective throughout the time of the swap 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
