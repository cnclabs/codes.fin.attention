the decrease in network access revenues was also due to a decline in the rate base  which affects the interstate pool settlements from the neca see regulatory matters section below 
surewest telephone s revenues can be impacted by shareable earnings obligations and changes in funding levels authorized by the cpuc 
during the years ended december  and  surewest telephone changed its estimates for a portion of its interstate shareable earning obligations and certain neca accounts receivable balances  related to prior year monitoring periods  resulting in an increase to revenues of and  respectively  as described in more detail in the regulatory matters section below

those revenues  which include local service  network access service and toll service  are derived from various sources  including business and residential subscribers  for basic exchange services  surcharges  mandated by the cpuc  long distance carriers  for network access service  competitive access providers and commercial enterprises  for network access service  interstate pool settlements from neca  support payments from federal or state programs  and support payments from the chcf  recovering costs of services including extended area service eas 
significant portions of surewest telephone s rates and charges are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc and the cpuc 
rates and charges are based on various tariffs filed by surewest and others  including those filed by the neca for interstate common line cl charges 
pending and future regulatory actions  with respect to these and other matters and the filing of new or amended tariffs  may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
fcc matters the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  surewest telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known 
based on preliminary cost studies  the company recognized liabilities relating to surewest telephone s estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations of for the year ended december  through reductions of revenues 
the company did not identify any interstate shareable earnings obligations at surewest telephone during the years ended december  or as a result of periodic cost separation studies required by the fcc  surewest telephone changed its estimates for certain neca cl accounts receivable balances related to prior year monitoring periods during the years ended december   and these changes in estimates increased the company s consolidated revenues by  and  respectively and net income by per share  per share and per share  respectively  for the years ended  and as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected aggregate liabilities of relating to surewest telephone s estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
in addition  surewest telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations lapse over time if surewest telephone s interexchange carriers and other customers do not claim the amounts ascribed to them 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of the company s liabilities for interstate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term 
given the ongoing activities of the fcc to promulgate rules and regulations on competition  interconnection  access charges  broadband deployment and universal service reform  and the various on going legal challenges considering the validity of these fcc orders  it is not yet possible to determine fully the impact of the telecommunications act of and related fcc regulations on surewest telephone s operations 
cpuc matters in  the company entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement  which was ultimately approved by the cpuc  to resolve an ongoing regulatory proceeding with various parties 
the settlement agreement resolved past sharing liabilities and suspended future sharing requirements in the intrastate jurisdiction 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  surewest telephone is returning approximately  dividend a  plus interest at the day commercial paper rate for non financial institutions  to its end users through a consumer dividend over a period of approximately four years  which began january  in addition  surewest telephone paid a one time consumer dividend of  dividend b to consumers to settle the monitoring periods to payable over approximately two years  which began january  and was completed in march as part of the settlement agreement  surewest telephone was to implement an additional annual consumer dividend of  on january  to end users receiving surewest telephone services subject to sharing on or after that date 
however  this consumer dividend was subject to reduction based upon the results of other pending regulatory proceedings 
pursuant to a cpuc order in december  beginning in this dividend was offset by a reduction in the company s interim draw from the chcf 
the interim draw from the chcf was previously authorized by a cpuc decision in august which allowed surewest telephone to continue receiving  annually from the chcf to offset its intrastate regulated operating expenses on an interim basis 
in august  the company requested permission from the cpuc to implement a graduated phase down of its annual  interim draw 
in december  the cpuc authorized the company to offset its interim draw from the chcf with the aforementioned  consumer dividend 
in september  the cpuc issued decision which provides for surewest telephone to phase down its annual chcf draw over a five year period  to end on january  the phase down of the interim draw began in january  initially reducing the annual  interim draw by the aforementioned  consumer dividend to  in each subsequent year  the interim chcf draw will be incrementally reduced by approximately  annually 
in  the cpuc initiated a rulemaking pursuant to senate bill commencing a review of the chcf b program 
the goals of this review included  but were not limited to  adjusting universal service rate support payments to reflect updated operating costs  evaluating whether chcf b support levels can be reduced and made more predictable and making the current administration of the program more efficient 
comments in the chcf b rulemaking were filed in september and in april in september  the cpuc approved a decision reforming the industry chcf b program which significantly reduced the chcf b program fund and its associated surcharge 
the decision reduces the current industry chcf b funding level by approximately and orders the reduction to be transitioned over an month period  which began in january and will end in july the company received approximately in based on this level of receipts and the threshold transition schedule outlined in the decision  the company s chcf b fund will be reduced approximately  and in july and january  respectively 
accordingly  the company s general chcf b fund draw will be approximately and in and  respectively 
furthermore  the decision lifts the freeze on basic residential rates beginning in january  however  the decision establishes a phase ii of the proceeding in which the cpuc may determine the amount by which the company may increase basic residential rates over time  among other issues 
the company will continue to evaluate this matter and the potential effects on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in an ongoing proceeding relating to the new regulatory framework under which surewest telephone has been regulated since  the cpuc adopted decision in  which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services  bundling of services  promotions and customer contracts 
this decision adopted a new regulatory framework  the uniform regulatory framework urf  which among other things i eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services except lifeline and basic residential services which will remain capped at current levels until january   ii allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services  iii allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and iv eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation  including the calculation of shareable earnings 
in december  the cpuc issued a final decision fd  in a proceeding investigating the continued need for an intrastate access element called the transport interconnection charge tic 
the fd caps surewest telephone s intrastate access charges at current levels through and eliminates its tic effective january  the company anticipates a reduction in its intrastate access revenues of up to approximately  when the tic is eliminated 
surewest telephone will have an opportunity to recover all or part of this lost revenue elsewhere  including residential rate adjustments as the current residential rate freeze expires on january  other regulatory matters there are a number of other regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on surewest telephone 
these regulatory proceedings include  but are not limited to  consideration of changes to the jurisdictional separations process  the interstate universal service fund  intercarrier compensation access charge reform  broadband deployment and the regulation of local exchange carriers and their competitors  including providers of internet protocol enabled services 
the outcomes and impact on surewest telephone s operations of these proceedings and related court matters cannot be determined at this time 
the regulatory proceedings occurring at the state and federal levels described above may also authorize new competition in the provision of regulated services and change the rates and rate structure for regulated services furnished by surewest telephone  the effects of which on surewest telephone cannot yet be determined
