item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are developing and commercializing off the grid rechargeable power sources for portable electronics 
we have developed a patented  proprietary direct methanol fuel cell technology platform called mobion  which generates electrical power using up to methanol as fuel 
our proprietary fuel cell power solution consists of two primary components integrated in an easily manufactured device the direct methanol fuel cell power engine  which we refer to as our mobion chip  and methanol replacement cartridges 
our mobion chip weighs less than one ounce and is small enough to fit in the palm of one s hand 
the methanol used by the technology is fully biodegradable 
we are currently the only micro fuel cell developer to have demonstrated power density of over mw cm with high energy efficiencies of wh cc of methanol 
for these reasons  we believe our technology offers a compelling alternative to current lithium ion and similar rechargeable battery systems currently used by original equipment manufacturers and branded partners  or oems  in many handheld electronic devices  such as mobile phones including smart phones and mobile phone accessories  digital cameras  portable media players  personal digital assistants  or pdas  and global positioning systems  or gps devices 
we believe our platform will facilitate the development of numerous product advantages  including small size  environmental friendliness  and simplicity of design  all critical for commercialization in the consumer market  and can be implemented as three different product options a compact external charging device  a snap on or attached power accessory  or a lithium ion battery replacement embedded fuel cell power solution 
we intend to commercialize the mobion platform in our mobion technology eliminates the need for active water recirculation pumps or the inclusion of water as a fuel dilutant 
the water required for the electrochemical process is transferred internally within the mobion chip from the site of water generation on the air side of the cell 
this internal flow of water takes place without the need for any pumps  complicated re circulation loops or other micro plumbing tools 
our mobion technology is protected by a patent portfolio that includes over us patent applications covering five key technologies and manufacturing areas 
our goal is to become a leading provider of portable power for handheld electronic devices 
we also design  manufacture  and sell high performance test and measurement instruments and systems serving three markets general dimensional gauging  semiconductor  and aviation 
these products consist of electronic  computerized gauging instruments for position  displacement and vibration applications for the design  manufacturing and test markets  semiconductor products for wafer characterization  and engine balancing and vibration analysis systems for military and commercial aircraft 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including completion of our portable power source products development activities  our ability to commercialize our portable power source products  market acceptance of our portable power source products  and other factors 
we expect to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic partnerships 
several key indicators of our liquidity are summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  cash and cash equivalents securities available for sale working capital net loss net cash used in operating activities purchase of property  plant and equipment from inception through december   we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue micro fuel cell product development and commercialization programs 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  sales of securities available for sale as well as the operating results of our businesses 
results of operations results of operations for the year ended december  compared to december  product revenue product revenue in our test and measurement instrumentation business for increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this performance was primarily the result of a  increase in activity by the us air force  driven by the new pbs systems contract 
also contributing were increased purchases by our japanese distributor particularly oem capacitance  as well as increased volume in semiconductor product shipments 
total product revenue for general dimensional gauging products increased by  or  to million  while total product revenue for semiconductor products increased by  or  to  in our test and measurement instrumentation business during  the us air force accounted for million  or  of product revenue while during  the us air force accounted for million  or  of product revenue

the doe contract is a cost share contract 
doe funding for this contract was suspended during january and reinstated during may during  we received notifications from the doe of funding releases totaling million and also received an extension of the termination date for the contract from july  to september  during february  we received notification from the doe of a funding release of  the samsung contract is a research and prototype contract 
this contract included one up front payment of  and two milestone payments of  each for the delivery of prototypes 
the contract was amended on october  as we agreed to issue a credit in the amount of the last invoice in recognition of our continuing collaboration with samsung 
therefore  revenue under this contract totaled  the saft contract is a fixed price contract 
this is a subcontract with saft under the us army cecom contract 
the purchase order received in connection with this subcontract was revised on november  eliminating one milestone 
as a result  the contract value was reduced from  to  and the expiration date was extended from september  to december  this contract was a cost plus catalyst research contract with the national center for manufacturing sciences  or ncms 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue in our test and measurement instrumentation business increased by  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a percentage of product revenue  the annual cost of product revenue remained relatively consistent with  and this increase was consistent with the higher revenue during gross profit as a percentage of product revenue decreased by to for the year ended december   remaining relatively consistent with funded research and product development expenses funded research and development expenses in our new energy business increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  while the active contracts were relatively consistent between periods  costs for the doe contract increased million  reflecting its reinstatement during may  while costs for the samsung contract increased by  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in costs for the saft contract of  as that contract was completed during the first quarter of unfunded research and product development expenses unfunded research and product development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a million decrease in development costs related to a the doe contract that resumed during may  which related increase is reflected in funded research and product development expenses  and b cost savings from the decision to suspend work on our high power program during march this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in product development expenses in our test and measurement instrumentation business reflecting increased staffing and external product development costs focused on the development of the division s new stand alone measurement and data acquisition solution  stand alone laser head  as well as other precision measurement solutions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a a  decrease in non cash stock based compensation charges reflecting the difference between sign on and promotion grants during compared with primarily annual compensation grants during and the reversal of expense during related to certain cancelled executive stock based performance grants where performance goals were not met  b a  decrease in outside services  including audit  legal  and consulting fees  c a  decrease in recruiting and relocation costs  d a  increase in severance costs attributable to employees terminated as a result of our march restructuring  e a  decrease in wages and benefits  which was also attributable to our march restructuring  f a  decrease in other operating expenses  primarily insurance and laboratory operating fees  g a  increase related to a decrease in allocations of expense from sg a to funded and unfunded research and development costs for overhead and other costs allocable to research and development programs  and h a  decrease in other expenses  net

gain loss on derivatives we recorded a gain on derivative accounting of million for the year ended december  and a gain of  on derivative accounting for the year ended december  both the and gains are the result of derivative treatment of the freestanding warrants issued to investors in conjunction with our december capital raise 
income tax expense benefit our income tax rate for the year ended december  was  while the income tax rate for the year ended december  was 
these tax rates were primarily the result of losses generated by operations  changes in the valuation allowance  state true ups upon tax return filings  permanent deductible differences for the derivative valuation  and disproportionate effects of reclassification of gains on plug power security sales included in operating loss 
the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december  was million and at december  was million 
we determined that it was more likely than not that the ultimate recognition of certain deferred tax assets would not be realized 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to december  product revenue product revenue in our test and measurement instrumentation business increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this performance was primarily the result of a an increase of million  or  in dimensional gauging sales  particularly direct capacitance sales through our japanese distributor  b increases in semiconductor sales of  as manual  one automatic  and one semi automated metrology tool systems were sold during the year  compared to seven manual  one semi automated  and four oem systems during  c commercial aviation equipment sales increases of  and d lower revenue from the us air force of  as a result of fewer purchases of new equipment and reduced activity under the existing repair contract

funded research and product development expenses new energy funded research and product development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decreased costs were attributable to active contracts during  which were no longer active during during  we had active contracts with samsung  doe and saft  while during we had active contracts with doe  nyserda  saft  nist  arl  and the marine corps 
unfunded research and product development expenses unfunded research and product development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase reflected a million increase in our new energy business related to increased internal costs for the development of micro fuel cell systems and costs in connection with developing prototypes and product intent prototypes  including a  non cash charge for share based compensation resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r  which requires that the fair value of share based compensation be expensed 
this increase also included a  increase in product development expenses in our test and measurement instrumentation business for projects related to the development of a glass thickness gauge  improvements to the portable engine vibration and balancing system  and updated industrial balancing software 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a an  increase in non cash equity compensation charges resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r  which required that the fair value of share based compensation be expensed  b a million decrease in salaries and engineering management costs  partially a result of an increase in costs directly charged to research and product development and the elimination of the government systems group during the second quarter of  c a  decrease related to increases in liquidations to unfunded research and development costs  which was a result of having charged more time to internal development projects for low power and high power technology platform developments  the development of prototypes for samsung  and the development of the mobion m product  d a  decrease in the los alamos national laboratory license fees as a result of an amendment of the license agreement  which resulted in reduced minimum annual license payments  e a  decrease in depreciation costs primarily related to the renewal of the lease on our main office  f a  increase in commission costs at mti instruments  g a  increase in incentive compensation primarily related to new executive employment agreements  h a  increase in marketing costs as mti micro raised its emphasis on marketing and business development and mti instruments underwent a major rebranding campaign during  and i a  decrease in other expenses  net 
operating loss operating loss increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  as a result of the factors noted above 
gain on sale of securities available for sale the gain on sale of securities available for sale for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we sold  shares of plug power common stock at a weighted average price of per share  with gross proceeds to us of million 
on june   fletcher international ltd  or fletcher  notified us of its election to exercise in full its right to purchase from us an amount of common stock of plug power 
as a result of this election  fletcher purchased  shares of plug power common stock from us at a price of per share  with proceeds to us of million 
in connection with this exercise  we recognized a loss on this embedded derivative immediately prior to exercise of million and a gain on the sale of plug power common shares of million 
gain loss on derivatives we recorded a gain on derivative accounting of  for the year ended december  and a loss of million on derivative accounting for the year ended december  the gain was the result of derivative treatment of the freestanding warrants issued in conjunction with our december capital raise  while the result related to an embedded derivative for the purchase of plug power common stock  which was issued as part of the private placement transaction 
the warrant derivative was valued using the black scholes pricing model  as was the embedded derivative prior to its exercise on june  upon exercise  the embedded derivative was valued at its intrinsic value 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense rate for the year ended december  was  while the income tax expense rate for the year ended december  was 
these tax rates were primarily the result of losses generated by operations  changes in the valuation allowance  and disproportionate effects of reclassification of gains on plug power security sales included in operating loss 
the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december  was million and at december  was million 
we determined that it was more likely than not that the ultimate recognition of certain deferred tax assets would not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant losses as we continue to fund the development and commercialization of our portable power source business 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  sales of securities available for sale  our operating results  the availability of equity financing  including warrants issued in connection with the december capital raise  and the ability to attract government funding resources to offset research and development costs 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   our results of operations resulted in a net loss of million and cash used in operating activities totaling million 
this cash use in was funded primarily by cash and cash equivalents on hand as of december  of million and proceeds from the sales of securities available for sale of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses as we seek to develop and commercialize our portable power source products and we expect to continue funding our operations from current cash and cash equivalents  the sales of securities available for sale  proceeds  if any  from equity financings  including warrants issued in connection with the december capital raise  and government funding 
we expect to spend approximately million on research and development of mobion technology and million in research and development on mti instruments products during additional financing during may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
cash used to support operations is expected to total approximately million and cash used for capital expenditures is expected to total approximately million 
capital expenditures will consist of purchases of manufacturing and laboratory equipment  software  computer equipment  and furniture 
proceeds from our sale of securities available for sale are subject to fluctuations in the market value of plug power 
we may also seek to supplement our resources through additional equity offerings  sales of assets including mti instruments  and additional government revenue could also provide more resources 
as of december   we owned  shares of plug power common stock 
potential future sales of plug power securities will generate taxable income or loss  which is different from book income or loss  as a result of the tax bases in these assets being significantly different from their book bases 
book and tax bases as of december  are as follows security shares held average book cost basis average tax cost basis plug power plug power stock is currently traded on the nasdaq global market and is therefore subject to stock market conditions 
when acquired  these securities were unregistered 
our plug power securities are considered restricted securities as defined in the securities laws and may not be sold in the future without registration under the securities act  unless in compliance with an available exemption from registration 
while our plug power shares remain restricted securities  these shares are now freely transferable in accordance with rule d under the securities act  subject to the limitations associated with such rule 
working capital was million at december   a million decrease from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of the use of cash in operations offset by proceeds from sale of securities available for sale 
at december   the company s order backlog was  compared to  at december  our inventory turnover ratios and average accounts receivable days sales outstanding for the years ended december  and and their changes are as follows years ended december  change inventory turnover average accounts receivable days sales outstanding the decline in inventory turnover stemmed from a higher year end inventory balance needed to support new product initiatives as these products gain acceptance in their targeted markets  as well as maintenance of higher stock levels to support continued growth at strategic end use customers 
the increase in average accounts receivable days sales outstanding in compared with was primarily attributable to our decision to grant our largest commercial customer day payment terms 
cash flow used by operating activities was million during compared with million during this cash use decrease of million reflected a net decrease of million in cash expenditures to fund operations coupled with net balance sheet changes  which increased cash expenditures by million  reflecting the timing of cash receipts and payments  particularly recognition of deferred revenue and payment of certain accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures were  during  a decrease of million from the prior year 
capital expenditures during included computer equipment  software  and manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
outstanding commitments for capital expenditures as of december  totaled  and included expenditures for laboratory and computer equipment 
we expect to finance these expenditures and other capital expenditures during with current cash and cash equivalents  the sale of securities available for sale  equity financing  and other sources  as appropriate and to the extent available 
during  we sold  shares of plug power common stock with proceeds totaling million and gains totaling million 
these proceeds reflect our previously announced strategy to raise additional capital through the sale of plug power stock to fund our micro fuel cell operations 
we expect the net gains to be offset by our operating losses for purposes of computing taxable income 
we estimate that as of december   our remaining net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements pursuant to a financing transaction between us and certain investors on december   we issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate  shares of our common stock exercisable at any time until december  at an exercise price per share of 
the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants would be issued under a shelf registration statement covering the resale of such shares 
the terms of the warrant agreement permits a cash settlement with the holders of the warrants if we are acquired by  or merge with  a private company 
because of the possibility of such a settlement  we have classified this agreement as an asset liability derivative in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of our most significant accounting policies 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  securities available for sale  income taxes  share based compensation and derivatives 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from development contracts based upon the relationship of actual costs to estimated costs to complete the contract 
these types of contracts typically provide development services to achieve a specific scientific result relating to direct methanol fuel cell technology 
some of these contracts require us to contribute to the development effort 
the customers for these contracts are commercial customers and various state and federal government agencies 
while government agencies are providing revenue  we do not expect the government to be a significant end user of the resulting products 
therefore  we do not reduce funded research and product development expense by the funding received 
when it appears probable that estimated costs will exceed available funding on fixed price contracts and we are not successful in securing additional funding  we record the estimated additional expense before it is incurred 
we apply the guidance in sab no 
 revenue recognition  in the evaluation of commercially funded fuel cell research and prototype agreements in order to determine when to properly recognize income 
payments received in connection with commercial research and prototype agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement for service related payments 
for milestone and prototype delivery payments  if and when achieved  revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the agreement 
when revenue qualifies for recognition it will be recorded as funded research and development revenue 
the costs associated with research and prototype producing activities are expensed as incurred 
expenses in an amount equal to revenue recognized are reclassified from unfunded research and product development to funded research and product development 
we also recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with sab no 
product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product to the customer or distributor has occurred  at which time title generally is passed to the customer or distributor  and we have determined that collection of a fixed fee is probable  all of which occur upon shipment of the product 
if the product requires installation to be performed by us  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as based on historical usage 
demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock and award restricted stock to our employees and directors under our equity incentive plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  and sec staff accounting bulletin  share based payments 
effective january   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of fas r with the modified prospective application  which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of fas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
share based compensation expense recognized under fas r for the year ended december  was million 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested awards granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of share based awards on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the value of each share based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under fas the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r during future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under fas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the intrinsic values realized upon the exercise  expiration  cancellation or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and expensed in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and expensed in our financial statements 
there is currently neither a market based mechanism nor other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor a way to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with fas r and sab using a qualified option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in fas r and sab is still relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december  using the black scholes model  we used the historical volatility of our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the black scholes model  consistent with the guidance in fas r and sab the risk free interest rate is based on the risk free zero coupon rate for a period consistent with the expected option term at the time of grant 
we do not currently pay nor do we anticipate paying dividends  but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the black scholes model 
as such  we use a zero dividend rate 
the expected option term is estimated using both historical term measures and projected termination estimates 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
included in this assessment is the determination of net operating loss carry forwards 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset 
the company must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses being carried forward 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the recorded valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million as of december  this valuation allowance is due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize certain of these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of the recoverability of certain net operating losses 
in the event actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which became effective for us beginning in fiscal fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
derivative instruments we account for derivative instruments and embedded derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the amended standard requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure these instruments at fair value 
fair value is estimated using the black scholes pricing model 
we also follow eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  which requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or a liability 
under the provisions of eitf issue no 
 a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument can be included in equity with no fair value adjustments required 
our asset liability derivatives are valued on a quarterly basis using the black scholes pricing model 
significant assumptions used in the valuation included exercise dates  closing prices for the company s common stock  volatility of our common stock  and a proxy risk free interest rate
