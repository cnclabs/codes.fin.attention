item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global leader in providing open source software solutions to the enterprise  including our core enterprise operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux and enterprise middleware platform  jboss enterprise middleware and other red hat enterprise technologies 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software 
because open source software code is freely shared  there are customarily no licensing fees for the distribution of the open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the aggregation  integration  testing  certification  delivery  maintenance and support of our red hat enterprise technologies  and by providing a level of scalability  stability and accountability for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute 
moreover  because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings  opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities 
we sell our enterprise technologies through subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers 
in addition  we generally provide certain managed services for each of our enterprise technologies  through red hat network rhn  jboss operations network jboss on and jboss customer support portal jboss support portal  as a component of our subscriptions 
we market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises  government organizations  small and medium size businesses and educational institutions 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for red hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture 
since introducing our initial enterprise open source operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux  it has gained widespread independent software vendor isv and independent hardware vendor ihv support 
we have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise offerings and introducing new systems management services  middleware  integrated virtualization and clustering capability  file management systems  directory and certificate technologies and enhanced security functionality 
we intend to bring the value of open source technology to other key areas of the enterprise infrastructure as the development community efforts support and customer needs dictate 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources i subscription revenue and ii training and services revenue 
the arrangements with our customers that produce this revenue and cash are explained in further detail under critical accounting policies below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these arrangements typically involve subscriptions to red hat enterprise technologies 
our revenue is affected by  among other factors  corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors  including total revenue  deferred revenue  operating income  operating margin and cash flows from operations 
on june  we acquired jboss  inc jboss  an open source company whose main products are middleware offerings developed and designed for service oriented architectures  permitting web enabled applications to run on open source and other platforms 
revenue 
for the year ended february   total revenue increased or million to million from million for the year ended february  this increase resulted primarily from an increasing level of adoption of red hat enterprise linux as a primary computing platform by the larger enterprise customers  as well as growing penetration of the small and mid sized business market and increased adoption of other red hat enterprise technologies 
the success of our business model is influenced by the 
table of contents acceptance and widespread deployment of our open source technologies  our ability to generate subscription revenue on a per installed system basis for red hat enterprise technology and our ability to increase annual average subscription revenue per customer by providing additional value to our customers in the form of additional technology infrastructure and by providing customers with additional services 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue  current and long term  balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenue improves predictability of future revenue 
deferred revenue at february  increased as compared to the balance at february  of million 
subscriptions 
our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
the subscription entitles the end user to maintenance  which generally consists of a specified level of support  as well as security updates  bug fixes  functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription through our integrated management technologies  rhn  jboss on and jboss support portal 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased each quarter of fiscal  and and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods 
revenue by geography 
we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific principally japan  singapore  india  australia  south korea and china 
in fiscal  approximately million or of our revenue was generated outside the united states compared to approximately million or for fiscal our international operations are expected to continue increasing as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
as of february   we had offices in more than locations throughout the world 
gross profit margin 
subscriptions made up and of total revenue for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
the gross profit margin on subscriptions was and for years ended february  and february   respectively 
these two overall trends  the increased percentage of sales represented by subscriptions and improvements in the gross profit margin of subscriptions  resulted in the improvement of our overall gross profit margin to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  income from operations 
operating income was and of total revenue for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue is a result of our increase in gross margin as described above 
operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  investments in research and development and investments in expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure resulted in increased operating costs as percentage of revenue of and  respectively 
these investments in research and development and sales and marketing infrastructure were partially offset by efficiencies realized in our general and administrative functions 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt securities and cash flow from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in debt securities balances at february  totaled billion 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions during the period 
our significant cash balance gives us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions  increasing investment in international areas and purchasing our own common stock and debt securities 

table of contents in our fiscal year ended february   we focused on  and expect in fiscal to continue to focus on  among other things  i gaining widespread acceptance and deployment by the enterprise of red hat enterprise linux and of jboss enterprise middleware  ii generating increasing subscription revenue by renewing subscriptions and providing additional value to our customers and by growing the number of enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture and iii generating increased revenue by providing additional systems management  developer and other services as well as from additional market penetration through a broader and deeper set of channel partner relationships  including oems  and our own international expansion  among other means 

table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  share based compensation  and deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and statement of position no 
 modification of sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
we establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer  a click through contract on our website whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms  signed or click through distribution contracts with oems and other resellers  or  in the case of individual training seats  through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise technologies 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription  subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed 
the deferred revenue amount is recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the subscription 
red hat enterprise technologies are generally offered with either one or three year base subscription periods  the majority of our subscriptions have one year terms 
under these subscription agreements  renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms 
the base subscription generally entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support pcs  generally consisting of a specified level of customer support and security errata  bug fixes  functionality enhancements to the technology and upgrades to new versions of the technologies  each on a when and if available basis  during the term of the subscription 
we sell our open source technologies through two principal channels direct  which includes sales by our sales force as well as web store sales  and indirect  which includes distributors  resellers and oems 
we recognize revenue from the sale of red hat enterprise technologies ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement 
subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements eg  software technology  maintenance  training  consulting and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of its fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered 
the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either i providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or ii selling the services on a stand alone basis 
training and services revenue training and services are comprised of revenue for consulting  engineering and customer training and education services 
consulting services consist of time based arrangements  and revenue is recognized as these services are performed 
engineering services represent revenue earned under fixed fee arrangements with our oem partners and other customers to provide for significant modification and customization of our red hat 
table of contents enterprise technologies 
we recognize revenue for these fixed fee engineering services using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  provided we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
under the percentage of completion method  earnings under the contract are recognized based on the progress toward completion as estimated using the ratio of labor hours incurred to total expected project hours 
changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known 
revenue for customer training and education services is recognized on the dates the services are complete 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill be tested at least annually using a two step process that begins with identifying potential impairment 
potential impairment is identified if the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies is less than the recognized or book value of the related reporting entity  including such goodwill 
where the book value of a reporting entity  including related goodwill  is greater than the reporting entity s fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for the years ended february   february  and february   we did not identify any potential impairment related to our goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
we perform this assessment on an annual basis  typically during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no significant impairment losses were recognized during fiscal  and for further discussion see note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation effective march   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation costs include a compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  march  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and b compensation costs for all share based awards granted on or subsequent to march   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in applying sfas r  we are required to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest and the amount of tax benefits we expect will ultimately be realized  among other things 
the amount of share based awards that actually vest and the amount of tax benefits from share based awards actually realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes as modified by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
during the year ended february   we recorded a net tax expense of million  which was net of a tax benefit of approximately million from foreign tax credits and a tax benefit of approximately million from the reduction of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset from research tax credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted from management s determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset from research tax credits will be realized 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  the benefit of the deferred tax asset attributable to us net operating loss nol carryforwards from share based compensation expense deductions  generated prior to adoption of sfas r  are being recognized as and only to the extent that taxes payable are reduced 
as these deferred tax assets attributable to nol s from share based compensation expense deductions are realized  the benefit of the deferred tax asset is recorded in additional paid in capital 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of nol s from share based compensation expense deductions in the united states 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of february   the net deferred tax asset balance was million  of which is offset by a valuation allowance 
we continue to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets with respect to nol s attributable to certain share based compensation expense deductions related to excess tax benefits recognized prior to the adoption of sfas r  certain foreign nol s and an acquired nol carryforward that is subject to a limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
it is our policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us from time to time however  we remit a portion of these earnings to the extent we do not incur additional us tax and it is otherwise feasible 
our effective tax rate could be affected by  among other things  changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates and certain share based compensation expenses arising from sfas r 
in july  the fasb issued fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by us on our tax returns 
we adopted fin effective march  our unrecognized tax benefits were million as of adoption  march  and million as of february  our unrecognized tax benefits at adoption and at february   which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate were million and million  respectively 
the cumulative effects of adopting fin are further explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions  in i calculating our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized

the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt

table of contents capital requirements we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our enterprise technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors  including the amount of resources we devote to funding the continued development of our enterprise technology products  accelerating the development of our systems management services  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers and support our business  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and investing in businesses  products and technologies 
we have utilized  and will continue to utilize  cash and investments to fund  among other potential uses  purchases of our common stock  purchases or redemption of our convertible debentures  purchases of fixed assets and mergers and acquisitions 
given our historically strong operating cash flow and the billion of cash and investments held at february   we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations  either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february  and february   we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations convertible debentures and other debt obligations  including related interest total because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future payments related to uncertain tax positions  such liabilities are not included in the above table 
however  as of february   we have recognized a total of million related to such liabilities  which are included in other long term obligations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a million change in interest income on an annual basis 
our convertible debentures are at a fixed interest rate and therefore interest expense is not impacted by a change in rates 
the fair market value of the debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of debt with conversion features permitting conversion into the issuer s stock  like our debentures  also generally increases as the market price of the underlying stock increases and decreases as the market price falls  assuming constant market interest rates 
interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of our debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the fair value of the debentures was approximately million and million based on quoted market prices as of february  and february   respectively 
investment risk the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  and february   respectively 
derivative instruments during the year ended february  we entered into a forward contract with a global financial institution to hedge foreign currency exposure associated with a japanese yen denominated transaction 
at february   the forward contract is recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
we have elected not to qualify the forward contract for hedge accounting treatment and as a result  changes in the fair value of the forward contract  which totaled million for the year ended february   are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
the notional amount of the outstanding forward contract at february  was million 
the fair value of the outstanding forward contract at february  was a million asset and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we did not hold derivative financial instruments at february  
table of contents foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended february  were produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the income statements of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue  operating expenses and net income for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue  operating expenses and net income will decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal  our revenue from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been lower than we reported using the exchange rates for fiscal by approximately million 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the applicable balance sheet dates  while related revenue and expense accounts of these operations are translated at average exchange rates during the month in which related transactions occur 
translation gains and losses are included as an adjustment to stockholders equity and included in other comprehensive income
