overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and service of consumables and systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences and clinical healthcare markets and are recognized as a market leader in creating breakthrough tools that are advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of life 
there are a number of factors that influence the size and development of our industry  including the availability of genomic sequence data for human and other organisms  technological innovation that increases throughput and lowers the cost of genomic and genetic analysis  the development of new computational techniques to handle and analyze large amounts of genomic data  the availability of government and private funding for basic and disease related research  the amount of capital and ongoing expenditures allocated to research and development spending by biotechnology  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  the application of genomics to new areas including molecular diagnostics  agriculture  human identity and consumer goods  and the availability of genetic markers and signatures of diagnostic value 
we have established our genechip system as the platform of choice for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex genetic information 
our integrated genechip platform includes disposable dna probe arrays chips consisting of gene sequences set out in an ordered  high density pattern  certain reagents for use with the probe arrays  a scanner and other instruments used to process the probe arrays  and software to analyze and manage genomic information obtained from the probe arrays 
we currently sell our products directly to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrichemical  diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic research centers  government research laboratories  private foundation laboratories and clinical reference laboratories in north america and europe 
we also sell our products through life science supply specialists acting as authorized distributors in latin america  india  the middle east and asia pacific regions  including china 
the following overview describes a few of the key elements of our business strategy and our goals increase top line revenue growth 
we intend to continue our top line revenue growth through the successful commercialization of our technologies and expansion of our customer base  including leveraging our technologies into new markets 
we also believe that the genotyping market will continue to be one of the most attractive growth opportunities in life sciences and that new content packaged in versatile formats will drive growth for years to come 
these opportunities include emerging cytogenetic and copy number diagnostics and our new drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters dmet product which we believe addresses a significant unmet need for our pharmaceutical partners 
we anticipate that these products and technologies will stimulate our business in and beyond 
in addition  our revenues in also includes a non recurring million intellectual property payment received in january while continued innovation is essential to create new opportunities  we are also pursuing additional paths to grow the business including our acquisition of usb corporation in january for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition is expected to significantly accelerate next generation enzymology and reagents that will be used with the sequencing applications that we have in development 
improve operating efficiency 
our goal is to generate continued improvement in gross margin throughout in february  we implemented a restructuring plan in order to optimize our production capacity and cost structure to enable us to increase our future gross margins 
we intend to move  by the end of  the majority of our probe array manufacturing from our west sacramento  california facility to our singapore facility 
in connection with this plan  we expect to incur total non cash charges in the first quarter of of million to million related to the abandonment of certain long lived manufacturing assets and approximately million in cash outlays related to employee severance 
depending on the rate at which we transfer production capacity to singapore  we may incur additional charges in associated with the reduction of capacity in west sacramento  california 
additionally  we will continue to monitor our expenses closely to help ensure our costs remain in line with our revenue growth 
critical accounting policies estimates general the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when and how to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and customer acceptance  if required  has occurred 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered to undelivered elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on any arrangement 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record specific bad debt allowances to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record allowances for bad debt on a small portion of all other customer balances based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories we enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  product expiration and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods  when appropriate  in order to report inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs  supplier arrangements  or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
non marketable equity securities as part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies  we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies 
our non marketable equity securities are carried at cost unless we determine that an impairment that is other than temporary has occurred  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we periodically review our investments for impairment  however  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the analysis may include assessment of the investee s i revenue and earnings trend  ii business outlook for its products and technologies  iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash  and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non marketable investments over the past few years 
income taxes income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  future levels of research and development spending  nondeductible expenses  changes in overall levels and geographical mix of pretax earnings and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits 
effective january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as a change in accounting principle 
as a result prior periods are not restated for the effect of fin  and the cumulative effect of applying fin was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
the cumulative effect of adoption was a million increase in the opening balance of accumulated deficit as a change in accounting principle 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was approximately million 
if recognized  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income from continuing operations and the effective tax rate is million 
any changes to acquisition related unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million will impact goodwill 
as of december   we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next months 
we classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately million for a total cumulative amount of million as of december  we file us federal  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
any reserves recorded may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
accounting for stock based compensation beginning january   we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
we determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility 
the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
sfas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
accordingly  in  we recognized employee stock based compensation of million million in cost of product sales  million in research and development expense and million in selling  general and administrative expenses  which includes approximately million related to the modification of an executive officer s stock option grant to increase the associated exercise period 
we adopted sfas r on a modified prospective basis 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options not yet recognized is expected to be allocated to cost of products sales and operating expenses over a weighted average period of years 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized under sfas r during the fiscal years prior to restructuring in recent years we engaged in  and may continue to engage in  restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation  realizable values of assets that may become duplicative or obsolete  and other exit costs 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a full description of our restructuring actions  see note recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fin under fin a company recognizes the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet 
we adopted fin effective january  as described in note in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurement 
sfas requires prospective application for fiscal year ending december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb no 
sfas 
the statement permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements in order to facilitate comparisons between entities choosing different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not affect existing accounting requirements for certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us for the fiscal year ending december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r amends sfas and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
it also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales the components of product sales are as follows in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from probe arrays      reagents     instruments      total product sales     total product sales increased in as compared to probe array sales increased primarily due to the growth in genotyping unit sales of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million related to a reduction in the average selling price of our probe arrays 
reagent sales grew primarily due to an increase of million related to growth in unit sales and million due to an increase in average selling price 
the average selling price of our probe arrays decreased primarily due to the implementation of our strategy to grow our market share in the genotyping market in and a shift in the pricing for our bundled consumables between probe arrays and reagents for our new snp products 
instrument sales decreased primarily due to a decline of million because of a drop in the average selling price of our genechip scanner and a decrease of million primarily due to reduction in unit sales 
total product sales decreased in as compared to probe array sales declined primarily due to a decrease of million related to the reduction of the average selling price of our probe arrays primarily due to a decrease in the selling price of our current two chip k genotyping product and a decrease of million due to a decline in unit sales 
instrument sales decreased primarily due to a decrease of million related to a decline in unit sales of our genechip scanner  a decrease of million due to a drop in unit sales of our genechip scanner high resolution upgrades and a decrease of million in unit sales of our automation equipment 
product related revenue in thousands  except percentage amounts the components of product related revenue are as follows year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from subscription fees      service and other     license fees and milestone revenue    total product related revenue    total product related revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in subscription fees of about million due to our efforts to transition our customers to the volume based pricing on array sales 
there was also a decrease of approximately million of other revenue related to our genotyping services business due to the variable timing of projects 
total product related revenue increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in service and other revenue of approximately million related to our genotyping services business 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in subscription fees earned under our genechip array access programs as we continue to transition customers to volume based pricing on array sales 
in january  under the terms of an expanded collaboration agreement  roche paid us an access fee of million  which we recognized as a component of product related revenue in license fees over the research and development period of approximately five years 
the amortization of this access fee was completed in royalty and other revenue in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from royalties and other revenue     royalties and other revenue increased in as compared to primarily due to the recognition of a million non recurring license fee related to a change of control provision 
our royalties and other revenues are primarily dependent on the issuance of new licenses and other intellectual property payments  which may fluctuate 
for example  in the first quarter of  we received a non recurring million intellectual property payment which will be recognized as other revenue 
the increase in royalties and other revenue in as compared to was primarily related to the recognition of million related to a license agreement entered into in the second half of with no continuing performance obligations 
we also recorded an additional million in deferred revenue related to this license agreement which will be recognized when the payment is received 
we expect to receive this payment in revenue from perlegen sciences  inc 
in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from revenue from perlegen sciences    perlegen revenue decreased in primarily due to lower demand for our commercial products 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into new supply agreements with perlegen  which include terms that are generally consistent with our standard supply terms and discontinued the requirement for royalty payments 
perlegen revenue increased in as compared to primarily related to increased demand by perlegen for our commercial probe arrays 
the increase of million was partially offset by a decrease in demand for wafers used by perlegen for internal research and development of million 
probe arrays and wafers used by perlegen for use in their internal research and development activities are sold at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
we also earn a royalty on certain of these wafers if they are used by perlegen for certain revenue activities 
royalties recognized were million and million in and  respectively 
we rely on reports from perlegen to recognize royalty revenue 
product and product related gross margins in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar point change from gross margin on product sales    gross margin on product related revenue   gross margin on product and product related revenue  product gross margin as a percentage of product sales product related gross margin as a percentage of product related revenue the point decrease in product gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to the following factors points of the decrease is attributable to a decline in the average selling price of our probe arrays as we implemented a strategy to increase our market share in the genotyping market in and a shift in the pricing for our bundled consumables between probe arrays and reagents for our new snp products  points of the decrease is attributable to a decline in the average selling price of our instrumentation products  and points of the decrease is attributable to higher costs of production for reagents 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase of points due to the growth in genotyping unit sales 
the point decrease in product related gross margins in is primarily due to a shift in product mix as our genotyping services business grew as a percentage of total product related sales 
in addition  sales of our genechip array access agreements declined as we continued to transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales 
the point decrease in product gross margin in as compared to is primarily due to the following three factors points of the decrease can be attributed to a decrease in the average selling price of our probe arrays primarily due to a decrease in the selling price of our two chip k genotyping product  points of the decrease is due to underutilized capacity in our probe array and instrument manufacturing facilities and increased manufacturing costs for our chips  points of the decrease is due to start up costs for our new singapore manufacturing facility 
these decreases were partially offset by a point increase in product gross margins as we sold more of our higher margin products 
the point decrease in product related gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our genotyping services business as well as the continuing decline in sales of our access agreements as we continue to transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales 
cost of perlegen revenues in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from cost of revenue from perlegen sciences    cost of perlegen revenue decreased in as compared to due to decreased demand for our commercial products 
cost of perlegen revenue was flat in as compared to primarily due to decreased demand by perlegen for wafers used for internal research and development which are sold at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing which was offset by an increase in the costs of commercial products purchased by perlegen 
research and development expenses in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from research and development     the decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in supplies and purchased services due to cost cutting measures and re prioritization of projects  a million decrease in total compensation and benefits due to a reduction in headcount  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of million primarily due to our acquisition of parallele as well as an increase in new hires in the first half of and an increase of million of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from selling  general and administrative    the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to cost cutting efforts including million of lower legal expenses  million of lower headcount related costs and million of lower stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in variable compensation due to our improved operating results 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was partially due to million of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r 
our stock based compensation expense included a million charge in the second quarter of due to the modification of an executive officer s stock option grant to include an extension of time to exercise as well as the vesting of certain stock options without a requisite service period 
additionally  legal expenses increased by million in as we continued to defend our patent rights 
in the third quarter of  we also incurred approximately million in costs related to our stock option review 
lastly  we saw an increase related to higher headcount related costs of million in acquired in process technology in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from acquired in process technology   during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million to acquired in process technology upon the october  completion of our acquisition of parallele  a provider of comprehensive genetic discovery solutions to the life science research  pharmaceutical and diagnostic sectors 
we utilized the assistance of a third party valuation specialist to help us determine the estimated fair value of certain research and development programs in process at the acquisition date that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these projects primarily included the development of a dna genotyping product and to a lesser extent certain rna and other expression products 
the fair values of these projects were determined using the income approach whereby we estimated each project s related future net cash flows between and and discounted them to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate of 
this discount rate is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing products and services based on complex genetic technologies and biochemical processes 
as of october   the dna genotyping project was complete and the rna other projects were complete and the expected costs to complete the dna genotyping project were approximately million and million to complete the rna and other projects 
as of december   there was no significant update to the percentage of completion of the projects  nor the anticipated costs to complete as certain of the projects were delayed during as we re prioritized our efforts in connection with our restructuring plans 
the estimates used by us in valuing the licensed technologies and acquired in process technologies were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
restructuring in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from restructuring     fiscal restructuring plan in july  we announced that we will be consolidating an administrative facility located in sunnyvale  california into our main campus in santa clara  california during the fourth quarter of the plan 
additionally  in august and december  we terminated certain employees in the research and development and selling  general and administrative functions 
we estimate that the total restructuring expenses to be incurred in connection with the plan will be approximately million 
of this total  we estimate that approximately million relates to employee severance and approximately million  net of estimated sublease income of million  relates to contract termination and million of other costs associated with vacating the leased kifer facility  which occurred during the fourth quarter of the estimated cash outlays to be incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  the costs relating to employee severance are being accrued over the remaining service periods of the employees 
during  we recognized approximately million of expense related to employee termination benefits associated with the plan  which was presented as a component of the line item labeled restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal restructuring plan in the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan the plan to better align certain of our expenses with our current business outlook 
our primary focus of the plan was in the general and administrative functions and included rationalizing our facilities 
in august  we terminated certain employees in the general and administrative functions 
additionally  in september  we announced our plan to close our bedford  massachusetts based instrumentation manufacturing and development facility 
we consolidated the bedford facility s instrument manufacturing operations with our probe array manufacturing facility in west sacramento  california 
our instrumentation development capabilities were consolidated with our principal research and development facilities located in santa clara  california 
implementation of the plan began in the fourth quarter of and continued into the first half of and eliminated or transferred certain positions 
the closure of our bedford  massachusetts facility was substantially completed by the third quarter of fiscal we estimate that the total restructuring expenses to be incurred in connection with the plan will be approximately million 
of this total  we estimate that million relates to employee severance and relocation benefits  million relates to contract termination costs associated with vacating the leased bedford facility  net of estimated sublease income of million  and approximately million relates to other restructuring costs such as fixed asset write downs and equipment and inventory relocation costs 
we incurred restructuring expenses beginning in the third quarter of and continued incurring related expenses through the third quarter of cash outlays incurred in connection with these restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  the costs relating to employee severance and relocation were accrued over the remaining service periods of the employees 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized approximately million of expense which was presented in a single line item labeled restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations  of which approximately million of the expense related to the modification of a former employee s equity awards  all of which became fully vested under the terms of a prior leave of absence agreement when he was involuntarily terminated in connection with the plan 
we have incurred total restructuring charges for both the plan and the plan of approximately million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
in february  we implemented a restructuring plan in order to optimize our production capacity and cost structure to enable us to increase our future gross margins 
we intend to move  by the end of  the majority of our probe array manufacturing from our west sacramento  california facility to our singapore facility 
in connection with this plan  we expect to incur total non cash charges in the first quarter of of million to million related to the abandonment of certain long lived manufacturing assets and approximately million in cash outlays related to employee severance 
depending on the rate at which we transfer production capacity to singapore  we may incur additional charges in associated with the reduction of capacity in west sacramento  california 
interest income and other  net in thousands  except percentage amounts the components of interest income and other  net  are as follows year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from interest income      realized loss in perlegen   write down of equity investment  net  currency gains losses  net   other    total interest income and other  net    interest income and other  net increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in our cash and marketable securities balances  higher yields on those balances and the recognition of a million net gain on an equity investment 
these increases were partially offset by the write down of a non marketable equity investment of million and a decrease in currency gains 
interest income increased in as compared to due to an increase in the returns on our cash and marketable securities balances 
in  we also realized a million currency gain on assets held in various foreign currencies 
in  we realized losses related to the recognition of our proportionate share of perlegen s net loss 
the carrying value of our investment in perlegen was written down to zero at december   therefore  to the extent we do not make any additional future investments in perlegen  we do not expect further expenses related to this investment 
interest expense in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from interest expense     interest expense increased in as compared to as we began recognizing interest expense on our million senior convertible notes issued in november interest expense remained flat in as compared to interest expense in and primarily consists of interest and amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our million senior convertible notes issued in december income tax provision benefit in thousands  except percentage amounts year ended december  dollar change from percentage change from income tax provision benefit    the provision for income taxes in is less than the us federal statutory rate applied to consolidated income before income taxes primarily due to income tax benefits related to federal and state research tax credits in the united states and due to income generated in foreign jurisdictions taxed at a lower rate than the us federal statutory rate 
in  the provision for income taxes was more than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions and the tax impact of non deductible stock based compensation expenses under sfas r 
in  the benefit for income taxes was more than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the reduction in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
a portion of our operations in singapore operate under various tax holidays and tax incentive programs  which expire in whole or in part at various dates through there was a minimal net impact from these tax holidays and tax incentive programs for the year ended december  sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
as of december   current net deferred tax assets totaled million 
non current net deferred tax assets totaled million 
we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized using factors that include historical book income  the scheduled reversal of temporary differences  and projected future book and taxable income in making this assessment 
based upon the weight of available evidence  as of december   we provided for a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets  of which million of the valuation allowance is recorded to offset benefits relating to stock options 
this amount of the valuation allowance will not be reduced until the benefit reduces tax that would otherwise be due 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to deferred tax assets in the period in which we make that determination 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million for us federal purposes  which expire in the years through for state purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in the years through additionally  we have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss or tax credits before utilization

liquidity we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  sales of equity and debt securities  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations  including a million intellectual property payment received from illumina in january  will enable us to maintain currently planned operations  acquisitions including our january acquisition of usb corporation for approximately million and capital expenditures estimated to be approximately million for the year ending december   for the foreseeable future 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating and financing plans  which are subject to change  and therefore we could require additional funding 
factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include future acquisitions  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
as of december   we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted interest rates by year of maturity for our available for sale securities and our debt obligations in thousands  except percentage amounts 
these amounts are primarily denominated in united states dollars  and the fair value of each as of december  and our available for sale securities are classified on our balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities short term and available for sale securities long term 
periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities   average interest rate liabilities senior convertible notes due  average interest rate senior convertible notes due  average interest rate periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities   average interest rate liabilities senior convertible notes due  average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we derive a portion of our revenues in foreign currencies  predominantly in europe and japan 
in addition  a portion of our assets are held in nonfunctional currencies of our subsidiaries 
in early  we began hedging activities by using currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposures created from our activities denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging program is designed to reduce  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
prior to  we hedged a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward contracts and the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in  we did not carry or initiate new currency forward contracts on a percentage of forecasted international revenue  based on management s internal assessment of the risk posed by extrapolating historical and potential future currency rate changes 
management will continue to reevaluate this risk on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we had no open hedging contracts
