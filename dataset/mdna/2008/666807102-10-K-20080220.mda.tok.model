n adoption of a new tax accounting standard on accounting for uncertain tax positions see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item outlook us defense contractors have benefited from the upward trend in overall defense spending over recent years 
certain programs in which the company participates may be subject to potential reductions due to a slower rate of growth in the us defense budget forecasts and funds being utilized to support the on going global war on terrorism 
despite the trend of slower growth rates in the us defense budget  the company believes that its portfolio of technologically advanced  innovative products  services  and integrated solutions will generate revenue growth in and beyond 
based on total backlog funded and unfunded of approximately billion as of december   the company expects sales in of approximately billion and forecasts improvement in net income over the major industry and economic factors that may affect the company s future performance are described in the following paragraphs 
industry factors northrop grumman is subject to the unique characteristics of the us defense industry as a monopsony  and by certain elements peculiar to its own business mix 
northrop grumman  along with lockheed martin corporation  the boeing company  raytheon company  and general dynamics corporation are among the largest companies in the us defense industry at this time 
northrop grumman competes against these and other companies for a number of programs  both large and small 
intense competition and long operating cycles are both key characteristics of northrop grumman s business and the defense industry 
it is common in this industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies 
a company competing to be a prime contractor may  upon ultimate award of the contract to another party  turn out to be a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting party 
it is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts 
the nature of 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation major defense programs  conducted under binding contracts  allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries 
the company s success in the competitive defense industry depends upon its ability to develop and market its products and services  as well as its ability to provide the people  technologies  facilities  equipment  and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency 
it is necessary to maintain  as the company has  sources for raw materials  fabricated parts  electronic components  and major subassemblies 
in this manufacturing and systems integration environment  effective oversight of subcontractors and suppliers is as vital to success as managing internal operations 
similarly  there is intense competition among many companies in the information and services markets which is generally more labor intensive with competitive margin rates over contract periods of shorter duration 
competitors in the information and services markets include the defense industry participants mentioned above as well as many other large and small entities with expertise in various specialized areas 
the company s ability to successfully compete in the information and services markets depends on a number of factors  most important is the capability to deploy skilled professionals  many requiring security clearances  at competitive prices across the diverse spectrum of these markets 
accordingly  various workforce initiatives are in place to ensure the company is successful in attracting  developing and retaining sufficient resources to maintain or improve its competitive position within these markets 
economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the defense of the us and its allies requires the ability to respond to one or more regional conflicts  terrorist acts  or threats to homeland security and is increasingly dependent upon early threat identification 
national responses to those threats may require unilateral or cooperative initiatives ranging from dissuasion  deterrence  active defense  security and stability operations  or peacekeeping 
the us government continues to place a high priority on the protection of its engaged forces and citizenry and in minimizing collateral damage when force must be applied in pursuit of national objectives 
as a result  the us and its military coalitions increasingly rely on sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  and precision strike capabilities combined with the ability to rapidly deploy effective force to any region 
accordingly  defense procurement spending is expected to be weighted toward the development and procurement of military platforms and systems demonstrating the stealth  long range  survivability  persistence and standoff capabilities that can overcome such obstacles to access 
additionally  advanced electronics and software that enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide for the real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms will also be required 
while the upward trend in overall defense spending may slow  defense requirements are not expected to change significantly in the foreseeable future 
many allied countries are focusing their development and procurement efforts on advanced electronics and information systems capabilities to enhance their interoperability with us forces 
the size of future us and international defense budgets is expected to remain responsive to the international security environment 
the proposed budget provides billion in discretionary authority for the dod base budget  representing a billion or percent increase over the enacted level for fiscal this proposed budget includes reductions in certain programs in which the company participates or for which the company expects to compete  however the company believes that spending on recapitalization and modernization of homeland security and defense assets will continue to be a national priority  with particular emphasis on areas involving intelligence  persistent surveillance  cyber space and non conventional warfare capabilities 
us government programs in which the company either participates  or strives to participate  must compete with other programs for consideration during the us budget formulation and appropriation processes 
budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for the size and structure of the company and the entire defense industry 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation substantial new competitive opportunities for the company include a new aerial refueling tanker  the next generation long range bomber  space radar  unmanned vehicles  satellite communications systems  restricted programs  technical services and information technology contracts  and several international and homeland security programs 
in pursuit of these opportunities  northrop grumman continues to focus on operational and financial performance for continued growth in and beyond 
northrop grumman has historically concentrated its efforts in high technology areas such as stealth  airborne and space surveillance  battle management  systems integration  defense electronics  and information technology 
the company has a significant presence in federal and civil information systems  the manufacture of combatant ships including aircraft carriers and submarines  space technology  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr  and missile systems 
the company believes that its programs are a high priority for national defense 
nevertheless  under budgetary pressures  there remains the possibility that one or more of them may be reduced  extended  or terminated by the company s us government customers 
the company provides certain product warranties that require repair or replacement of non conforming items for a specified period of time 
most of the company s product warranties are provided under government contracts  the costs of which are generally incorporated into contract pricing 
prime contracts with various agencies of the us government and subcontracts with other prime contractors are subject to numerous procurement regulations  including the false claims act and the international traffic in arms regulations promulgated under the arms export control act  with noncompliance found by any one agency possibly resulting in fines  penalties  debarment  or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all us government agencies 
given the company s dependence on us government business  suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on the company

contracts the majority of the company s business is generated from long term government contracts for development  production  and service activities 
government contracts typically include the following cost elements direct material  labor and subcontracting costs  and certain indirect costs including allowable general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cost accounting standards cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by the company and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include  but are not limited to  certain legal costs  lobbying costs  charitable donations  and advertising costs 
the company s long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories flexibly priced contracts includes both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts 
cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price incentive contracts also provide for 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs  but are subject to a cost share limit which affects profitability 
fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached 
firm fixed price contracts a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 
the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer us other percent in millions government customers total of total flexibly priced firm fixed price total contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fees  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  percentage of completion of the contract  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
positive award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical performance 
award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against such negotiated criteria 
award fee contracts are widely used throughout the company s operating segments 
examples of significant long term contracts with substantial negotiated award fee amounts are the kei  sdd  e d sdd  lpd  and ddg programs 
compliance and monitoring on a regular basis  the company monitors its policies and procedures with respect to its contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview the majority of the company s business is derived from long term contracts for the construction of facilities  production of goods  and services provided to the federal government  which are accounted for under the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
accounting for long term construction type contracts  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and the aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors 
the company classifies contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts 
the company also enters into contracts that are not associated with the federal government  such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers 
the company accounts for those contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 
the company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when it determines the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting the company generally recognizes revenues from its long term contracts under the cost to cost and the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for certain contracts with large up front purchases of material  primarily in the ships segment  sales are generally calculated based on the percentage that direct labor costs incurred bear to total estimated direct labor costs 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
the company estimates profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability of the company to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of its products and services 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
sales under cost type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that cannot be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 
other changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimates had been the original estimates 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain service contracts revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers are generally recognized when services are performed 
service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements  primarily in the information and services business 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred  except that direct and incremental set up costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
service contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 
cost estimation the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  program managers  and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contract cost estimates are updated at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded to cost of sales in the period the loss is determined 
loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
purchase accounting and goodwill overview the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period typically not exceeding twelve months with the exception of certain adjustments related to income tax uncertainties  the resolution of which may extend beyond the purchase price allocation period 
acquisition accruals the company has established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from its acquisitions and divestitures 
these accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on management s experience 
goodwill the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november th of each year  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
in order to test for potential impairment  the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis  corroborated by comparative market multiples where appropriate 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies overview the company is subject to a range of claims  lawsuits  environmental and income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
environmental accruals the company is subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it conducts operations 
the company records an accrual to provide for the costs of expected environmental obligations when management becomes aware that an expenditure will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
factors which could result in changes to the company s assessment of probability  range of loss  and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more extensive 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation contamination than anticipated  results of efforts to determine legally responsible parties  changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements  and improvements in remediation technology 
although management cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will materially affect the estimated liability accrued  management does not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
litigation accruals litigation accruals are recorded as charges to earnings when management  after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each matter  including any settlement offers  has determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to the company may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
based upon the information available  the company believes that the resolution of any of these various claims and legal proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
uncertain tax positions effective january   the company measures and records uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
the timing and amount of accrued interest is determined by the applicable tax law associated with an underpayment of income taxes 
if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period the tax position is claimed in the tax return of the company 
the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
penalties  if probable and reasonably estimable  are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item prior to  the company recorded accruals for tax contingencies and related interest when it determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of the contingency could be reasonably estimated based on specific events such as an audit or inquiry by a taxing authority 
under existing gaap  changes in accruals associated with uncertainties arising from the resolution of pre acquisition contingencies of acquired businesses are charged or credited to goodwill 
adjustments to other tax accruals are generally recorded in earnings in the period they are determined 
retirement benefits overview assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans are evaluated annually by management in consultation with its outside actuaries 
in the event that the company determines that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
assumptions the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rates 
for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity investments and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined based on the results of a hypothetical long term bond portfolio matching the expected cash inflows with the expected benefit payments 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation for each benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  the company s weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations

general and administrative expenses in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts  most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts and such costs  for most components of the company  are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors include this cost component as an element of cost 
general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations 
general and administrative expenses remained at a constant rate of approximately percent of sales in and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from percent in to percent in the increase in is due primarily to higher property insurance  litigation  and bid and proposal costs  partially offset by lower ir d 
operating margin the company considers operating margin to be an important measure for evaluating its operating performance and  as is typical in the industry  defines operating margin as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and general and administrative expenses

these realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services 
in january  certain programs and business areas were transferred among information technology  mission systems  space technology  and technical services 
the operating results for all periods presented have been revised to reflect these changes 
see a description of the segment business areas and specific realignments located in part i  item 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation subsequent realignments in january  the newport news and ship systems sectors were realigned into a single segment called northrop grumman shipbuilding to enable the company to more effectively utilize its shipbuilding assets and deploy its talented shipbuilders  processes  technologies  production facilities and planned capital investment to meet customer needs 
this realignment had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows  or segment reporting 
also in january  the company announced the transfer of certain programs and assets from the mission systems segment to the space technology segment  effective july  this transfer will allow mission systems to focus on the rapidly growing command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance business  and the missiles business will be an integrated element of the company s aerospace business growth strategy

key segment financial measures operating performance assessment and reporting the company manages and assesses the performance of its businesses based on its performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below  with consideration given to the critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments described on page based on this approach and the nature of the company s operations  the discussion of consolidated results of operations generally focuses around the company s seven reportable segments versus distinguishing between products and services 
product sales are predominantly generated in the electronics  integrated systems  space technology and ships segments  while the majority of the company s service revenues are generated by the information technology  mission systems and technical services segments 
funded contract acquisitions funded contract acquisitions represent amounts funded during the period on customer contractually obligated orders 
funded contract acquisitions tend to fluctuate from period to period and are determined by the size and timing of new and follow on orders and by obligations of funding on previously awarded unfunded orders 
in the period that a business is purchased  its existing funded order backlog as of the date of purchase is reported as funded contract acquisitions 
in the period that a business is sold  its existing funded order backlog as of the divestiture date is deducted from funded contract acquisitions 
sales and service revenues period to period sales generally vary less than funded contract acquisitions and reflect performance under new and ongoing contracts 
changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume 
unless otherwise described  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in revenues incurred due to varying production activity levels  delivery rates  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes will typically carry a corresponding margin change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 
segment operating margin segment operating margin reflects the performance of segment contracts 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far  and therefore not allocated to the segments 
changes in segment operating margin are typically expressed in terms of volume  as discussed above  or performance 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract 
operating margin changes are accounted for on a cumulative to date basis at the time an eac change is recorded
