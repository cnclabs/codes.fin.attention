overview core molding technologies is a compounder of sheet molding composite smc and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics 
core molding technologies produces high quality fiberglass reinforced molded products and smc materials for varied markets  including light  medium and heavy duty trucks  automobiles and automotive aftermarkets  personal watercraft  and other commercial products 
the demand for core molding technologies products is affected by economic conditions in the united states  canada  and mexico 
core molding technologies manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core molding technologies operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
on december   core molding technologies acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of navistar s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late columbus plastics  located in columbus  ohio  was a compounder and compression molder of smc 
in  core molding technologies began compression molding operations at its second facility in gaffney  south carolina  and in october  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of airshield corporation 
as a result of this acquisition  core molding technologies expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up  hand lay up open mold processes and resin transfer rtm closed molding utilizing a vacuum infusion process 
in september  core molding technologies acquired substantially all the operating assets of keystone restyling products  inc  a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced products for the automotive aftermarket industry 
in august  core molding technologies acquired certain assets of the cincinnati fiberglass division of diversified glass  inc  a batavia  ohio based  privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy duty truck market 
the batavia  ohio facility produces reinforced plastic products by a spray up open mold process and resin transfer molding rtm utilizing multiple insert tooling mit closed mold process 
core molding technologies recorded net income for of  or per basic and per diluted share  compared with  or per basic and per diluted share  in the year net income was negatively impacted by decreased sales volumes due to lower demand resulting from an industry wide decline in truck orders 
stricter federal emission standards for increased demand throughout for heavy and medium duty trucks as customers purchased vehicles in advance of the new emission standards 
demand in has declined as anticipated by industry analysts who estimated a twenty to forty percent decrease in new orders for heavy and medium duty trucks compared to demand 
in addition to the 
table of contents effect of lower sales  net income was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies resulting from new product launches and varying production levels caused by inconsistent customer orders as well as lower fixed cost absorption 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate decrease from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project sales result from billings to customers for molds and assembly equipment built specifically for their products 
these sales are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend 
tooling project revenues relate to both replacement models and new business awarded to the company 
total product sales revenue for  excluding tooling project revenue  totaled  an approximate decrease from the  reported for the primary reason for the decrease in product sales is lower demand resulting from an industry wide general decline in truck orders due to the new federal emissions standards that went into effect on january  and was partially offset by new business awarded to the company 
sales to navistar in totaled  an approximate decrease from the amount of  included in total sales is  of tooling sales for compared to  in total product sales to navistar have decreased by for as compared to the primary reason for the decrease in product sales is lower demand resulting from an industry wide general decline in truck orders as noted above  and was partially offset by new business with navistar 
sales to paccar in totaled  an approximate increase from sales amount of  included in total sales is  of tooling sales for compared to  in total product sales to paccar have decreased by for as compared to the primary reason for the decrease in sales to paccar is a result of the industry wide decline in truck orders as noted above  which was partially offset by new business with paccar 
sales to other customers decreased by approximately to  in from  in this decrease is primarily related to the general decline in truck orders from other truck manufacturers core molding technologies serves and reduced sales to an automotive supplier 
gross margin was approximately of sales in compared to of sales in the decrease in gross margin was due to a combination of factors including production inefficiencies resulting from new product launches and varying production levels caused by inconsistent customer orders 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was lower fixed cost absorption due to lower product sales volumes 
our manufacturing operations have significant fixed costs such as labor  energy  depreciation  lease expense and post retirement healthcare costs that do not change proportionately with sales 
partially offsetting the decrease in gross margin was lower profit sharing expense due to lower earnings 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a totaled  in  decreasing from  incurred in the primary reasons for this decrease are lower profit sharing expense due to lower earnings  lower wage and benefit costs related to reductions in personnel  as well as lower professional fees  outside services and insurance costs 
interest income decreased to  in compared to  in this change is primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of stock from navistar 
on july    of cash balances were used to partially finance this repurchase  resulting in lower interest income 
interest expense increased to  in compared to  in the increase in interest expense is related to borrowings of  against the line of credit that was used to finance the remaining portion of the stock repurchase from navistar 
partially offsetting higher interest expense from the share repurchase was a reduction in interest associated with reductions of long term debt due to regularly scheduled payments 
variable interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its two long term borrowing facilities have increased  however  due to the interest rate swaps previously entered into by core molding technologies  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these two debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to approximately in the decrease is primarily due to the company qualifying for certain manufacturing production activity deductions for its us manufacturing facilities under section of the internal revenue code as well as state and local tax refunds received

gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the primary reason for the increase in gross margin  as a percentage of sales was due to better absorption of fixed costs of production due to the increases in production volumes 
these gains were partially offset by increased profit sharing amounts resulting from improved profits 
selling  general  and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to increases in the company s profit sharing amounts resulting from increased profits and increases in professional and outside services 
interest income increased to  in compared to  in due to increases in cash balances and the increase in the interest rate earned on those cash balances 
interest expense decreased to  in compared to  in contributing to the reduction of net interest expense was capitalized interest in of approximately  relating to the columbus plant expansion  as well as a reduction in debt from regularly scheduled principal payments 
there was no capitalized interest recorded in interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its long term borrowing facilities were favorable  however  due to the interest rate swaps core molding technologies entered into  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to approximately in the decrease is primarily due to the company qualifying for certain manufacturing production activity deductions for its us manufacturing facilities under section of the internal revenue code

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns  customer rework chargebacks  discounts offered to customers  and price adjustments 
should these customer returns  chargebacks  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company has reduced accounts receivable for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets annually on december st 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities below the assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and self insurance the company is self insured with respect to most of its columbus and batavia  ohio and gaffney  south carolina medical and dental claims and columbus and batavia  ohio workers compensation claims 
the company has recorded an estimated liability for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at december   and of  and  respectively 
post retirement benefits management records an accrual for postretirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated notes to financial statements 
core molding technologies recorded a liability for postretirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products  chargebacks and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when 
table of contents the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
income taxes 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its two largest customers navistar and paccar  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  the deferred tax asset of  at december  primarily includes temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s property and equipment of approximately  inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
due to the cost of crude oil and natural gas  raw material prices have increased and may continue to rise in these increases could have a significant impact on the future results of operations
