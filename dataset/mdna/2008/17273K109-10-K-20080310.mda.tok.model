item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities and we also incurred and expensed an additional million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we also expect to capitalize million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  and also expect to incur and expense charges of approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  
table of contents item a 
risk factors certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur our leslie controls  inc subsidiary is subject to asbestos related litigation that could ultimately have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
as more fully described in part i  item legal proceedings  our leslie controls  inc subsidiary leslie has been and continues to be named as a defendant in asbestos related product liability actions 
the actual amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the numbers of trials and settlements 
historically  leslie s defense and resolution of these asbestos related claims has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  leslie recorded an additional liability of million and anticipated insurance recoveries of million  for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its current open claims 
although leslie believes this estimate is reasonable  such estimate also is highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history is relatively limited  very recent  and quite variable 
as a result  the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
in addition  while future claims are probable  leslie s management cannot estimate the losses that may arise from such future claims and we  therefore  have not accrued a liability for such future claims 
leslie also incurs significant costs in defending asbestos claims and we record these costs at the time incurred 
a significant increase beyond our estimates in the cost to leslie of resolving current claims  the incurrence of significant liability with respect to future claims  or a significant increase in the cost of defending current and future asbestos claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
leslie s primary insurance carriers currently pay of each defense and indemnity dollar incurred with respect to asbestos claims 
leslie management believes that the amount of insurance remaining in its primary layer should be sufficient to cover resolution of its current claims 
while future claims are probable  we cannot estimate the amount of any liabilities associated with such future claims  however  resolution of such future claims could result in an exhaustion of the primary layer of insurance 
because leslie has limited available excess insurance coverage  an exhaustion of its primary insurance layer would likely result in leslie becoming responsible for a substantial majority of any defense and indemnity costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in this regard  we refer the reader to and incorporate by reference part i  item captioned legal proceedings in this annual report on form k and to part i  item i captioned legal proceedings in our periodic filings on form q which provides more specific information regarding the amount of primary layer insurance remaining 

table of contents we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues and shareholders equity is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face the continuing impact of economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as well as current conflicts in iraq and the rest of the middle east 
in the past  terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions have improved considerably  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current conflicts in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 

table of contents if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
commencing in and continuing in  we embarked on a company wide program to implement lean manufacturing techniques 
we believe that this process will produce meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  implementation of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to successfully implement these processes our anticipated profitability may suffer 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 

table of contents implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and energy products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them and may result in an impairment charge 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 

table of contents if we can not pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 
if our suppliers cannot provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate those customers if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
during and part of  we experienced diminished supplier performance that negatively impacted our operating and net income 
the diminished supplier performance was the result of the closure of certain suppliers  problems with new supplier on time delivery reliability as well as lower than expected new supplier qualification acceptance 
while we believe that we have taken appropriate steps to remediate these lower supplier performance issues and to alleviate the diminished impact on profitability  a continuation or recurrence of these factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous 
table of contents materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in its report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include 
table of contents inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or with respect to passive investors or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 

table of contents our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our outstanding industrial revenue bond  and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated december  and amended october   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has in the past experienced price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including significant manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations

our tampa facility is subject to a collateral assignment under a loan agreement with a long term lender 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends and by successful implementation of our on going lean manufacturing initiatives 
item legal proceedings like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  our subsidiary leslie controls  inc leslie  which we acquired in  has been and continues to be named as a defendant in product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as alleged successor in interest in these cases 
as of december   leslie was a named defendant in approximately active  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in california  texas  new york  massachusetts  connecticut  and other states excluding mississippi 
of these claims  approximately involve claimants allegedly suffering from or the estates of decedents who allegedly died from mesothelioma  a fatal malignancy associated with asbestos exposure 
in addition  leslie was also a named defendant in approximately  unresolved asbestos related claims filed in mississippi 
since  however  the mississippi supreme court has interpreted joinder rules more strictly  and the state legislature enacted a tort reform act under which each plaintiff must independently satisfy venue provisions  thus preventing thousands of out of state claimants from tagging onto a single in state plaintiff s case 
as a result of these changes  mississippi state court judges since have severed and dismissed tens of thousands of out of state asbestos claims against numerous defendants including leslie 
we continue to expect that most of the remaining mississippi claims against leslie will be dismissed as well 
leslie has not incurred any indemnity costs in mississippi and defense costs to resolve these mississippi cases have not been significant 
while it is possible that certain dismissed claims could be re filed in mississippi or in other jurisdictions  any such re filings likely would be made on behalf of one or a small number of related individuals who could demonstrate actual injury and some connection to leslie s products 

table of contents leslie s asbestos related claims generally involve its fluid control products 
leslie management believes that any asbestos was incorporated entirely within the product in a way that would not allow for any ambient asbestos during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
leslie and its insurers general strategy have been to vigorously defend these cases 
nevertheless  while we strongly believe that exposure to leslie s products has not caused asbestos related illness to any plaintiff  there is no assurance that juries or courts will not reach a different conclusion in particular cases 
leslie has resolved a number of asbestos related claims over the past few years and continues to do so for strategic reasons  including avoiding defense costs and the possible risk of excessive verdicts 
the amounts expended on asbestos related claims in any year may be impacted by the number of claims filed  the volume of pre trial proceedings  and the numbers of trials and settlements 
to date  leslie s defense and resolution of these asbestos related claims have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
during our fiscal year leslie resolved a total of asbestos cases for an aggregate indemnity amount of million  of which or million was paid by insurance 
leslie s insurance coverage is further discussed below 
the following tables provide more specific information regarding leslie s claim activity and defense costs during each of the three years ended december  as well as the financial impact on the company of the asbestos litigation for such periods excluding open mississippi cases for which we anticipate dismissal of virtually all such cases for the reasons described above for the year ended december beginning open cases cases filed cases resolved and dismissed ending open cases ending open mesothelioma cases for the year ended december in thousands settlement costs incurred adverse verdicts accrued open case accrual defense cost incurred less insurance recoveries net pre tax expense average pre tax settlement amount per case resolved dismissed the information reflected above includes a jury verdict rendered on october  by a los angeles state court jury that  if allowed to stand  would result in a liability to leslie of approximately million  or approximately million  would be paid by leslie while insurance would pay the balance 
although leslie accrued a liability in the third quarter of fiscal for this verdict  both 
table of contents leslie and the other defendant against whom the judgment was rendered have appealed this verdict 
we believe there are strong grounds for either significantly reducing the amount of the award or for requiring a new trial 
leslie records an estimated liability associated with reported asbestos claims when it believes that a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in prior periods  with respect to its unresolved pending claims  leslie did not believe that it had sufficient information to assess the likelihood of resolving such claims 
accordingly  until the fourth quarter of  leslie accrued for defense costs as incurred  and accrued for pending claims only when resolution of a particular claim was probable and the probable loss was estimable 
as a practical matter  the claims accrual generally occurred close in time to when a settlement agreement for a particular claim was reached 
in most cases  settlement payments are paid to claimants within thirty to sixty days of settlement 
in the only two cases in which leslie has received an adverse verdict  leslie has accrued million for such claims at the time the adverse verdict was rendered 
leslie also recorded an insurance receivable of million to be paid by its insurers for these adverse verdicts 
in both cases  leslie has appealed the judgment rendered against it and leslie is not at this time able to determine when or if those accrued amounts ultimately will be paid or not 
over the last few years  leslie has continued to accumulate data associated with its asbestos claims 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed a detailed review of our leslie asbestos matters 
this review  among other items  included an assessment of leslie s historical filed  resolved and dismissed claim rates 
in conducting this review  certain factors caused us to determine that the likelihood of incurrence of indemnity costs for existing cases was now probable 
the most significant of these factors include an escalation  commencing in and continuing in  of the rate of claim resolutions and filings  as well as the incurrence  for the first time in  of adverse jury verdicts 
from to  our claim settlement costs increased more than and our cases filed increased more than 
as part of our review of asbestos matters we engaged hamilton  rabinovitz and associates  inc hr a  a firm specializing in estimating expected liabilities of mass tort claims  to help us determine an estimate of leslie s asbestos related liabilities 
because leslie s claims experience is both limited and variable  hr a concluded that any estimate of pending or future liabilities of leslie s asbestos claims would be highly uncertain from a statistical perspective 
leslie s management has determined  however  that  by using its historical albeit brief average cost by disease classification in resolving closed claims  and by applying this information to the mix of current open claims as of december   it could make a reasonable estimate of the indemnity costs to be incurred in resolving such current open claims 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of leslie recorded an additional liability of million for the estimated indemnity cost associated with resolution of its current open claims 
leslie expects that payment of the amounts accrued with respect to the open claims will be made by leslie and its insurers over the next three years 
the recording of this liability resulted in a pretax charge of million  net of insurance recoveries 
a summary of leslie s unpaid existing asbestos claims and incurred asbestos defense cost liabilities and the related insurance recoveries is provided below 
as of december in thousands existing claim indemnity liability incurred defense cost liability insurance recoveries 
table of contents although leslie believes its estimates are reasonable  such estimates are also highly uncertain  especially because leslie s claims history is relatively limited  very recent  and quite variable 
depending on future events  the actual costs of resolving these pending claims could be substantially higher or lower than the current estimate 
some of the more significant unknown or uncertain factors that will affect these costs going forward include the severity of the injuries alleged by each pending claimant  increases or decreases in leslie s average settlement costs  possible adverse or favorable jury verdicts  rulings on unresolved legal issues in various jurisdictions that bear on leslie s legal liability  the numbers of claims that will be dismissed with no indemnity payments  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards in different jurisdictions  the potential bankruptcies of other companies named as defendants in asbestos related claims 
as a result of these factors  leslie is unable to estimate a range of additional losses that may be reasonably possible in the event that actual indemnity costs of resolving pending claims are higher than our estimate 
in addition  while the likelihood of future claims is probable  leslie s management cannot estimate the amount of new claims or any range of losses that may be reasonably possible arising from such future claims 
with respect to current claims  critical information is known regarding such factors as disease mix  jurisdiction and identity of plaintiff s counsel 
such information is of course unknown with respect to any future claims  and leslie s management believes that the disease mix  jurisdictional information and plaintiff counsel identity associated with its current case experience  which has been both limited and variable  cannot reasonably be extrapolated to any future filings 
moreover  leslie management believes that appellate actions recently commenced and currently pending in certain jurisdictions such as california  together with movements toward legislative and judicial reform in such jurisdictions may significantly alter the litigation landscape  thus affecting both the rate at which claims may be filed as well as the likelihood of incurring indemnity amounts on account of such future claims and the level of indemnity that may be incurred to resolve such claims 
to date  leslie s insurers have paid the vast majority of the costs associated with its defense and settlement of asbestos related actions 
under leslie s current cost sharing arrangements with its insurers  leslie s insurers pay of defense and settlement costs associated with asbestos related claims and leslie is responsible for the remaining of all such defense and indemnity costs 
the amount of indemnity available under leslie s primary layer of insurance coverage is therefore reduced by of any amounts paid through settlement or verdict 
we believe that  as of december   excluding the impact of the october  adverse jury verdict  and without giving effect to our estimate for the indemnity cost of resolving pending claims  the aggregate amount of indemnity remaining on leslie s primary layer of insurance was approximately million 
if the october  jury verdict were to stand  our primary layer of insurance could be reduced by an additional million 
similarly  if our estimate of the indemnity cost of resolving pending claims is accurate  such resolution ultimately would further reduce the aggregate amount of primary layer indemnity by approximately million 
based on its current estimate of costs to resolve leslie s pending asbestos claims  leslie s management believes that this primary layer of insurance should be sufficient to cover such pending claims 
as set forth above  we 
table of contents cannot estimate the amount of any liabilities associated with such future claims and therefore cannot reasonably estimate when and if the primary insurance may be eroded 
in addition  leslie has limited available excess insurance coverage 
some of this excess insurance  however  lies above layers of excess insurance written by insolvent insurers  which could affect when leslie may be able to recover this excess insurance 
moreover  unlike primary policies under which defense costs do not erode policy limits  the terms of excess policies typically provide that covered defense costs do erode policy limits 
as a result  if its primary insurance layer were exhausted  leslie would likely become responsible for a substantial majority of any defense and indemnity costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that payment of any litigation related asbestos liabilities of leslie leslie currently constitutes approximately of the company s consolidated revenues and shareholders equity is legally limited to the net assets of that subsidiary 
this belief is based on the principle of american law that a shareholder including a parent corporation is generally not liable for an incorporated entity s obligations 
smaller numbers of asbestos related claims have also been filed against two of our other subsidiaries spence engineering the stock of which we acquired in  and hoke  the stock of which we acquired in due to the nature of the products supplied by these entities  the markets they serve and our historical experience in resolving these claims  we do not believe that asbestos related claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of spence or hoke  or the financial condition  consolidated results of operations or liquidity of the company

overview circor international  inc is a leading provider of valves and fluid control products for the industrial  aerospace  petrochemical  and energy markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
we have organized the company into two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including military and commercial aerospace  chemical processing  marine  power generation  commercial hvac systems  food and beverage processing  and other general industrial markets 
the energy products segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
our growth strategy includes organic profitable growth as well as strategic acquisitions that extend our current offering of engineered flow control products 
for organic growth  our businesses focus on 
table of contents developing new products and reacting quickly to changes in market conditions in order to help grow our revenues 
regarding acquisitions  we have made twelve acquisitions in the last six years that extended our product offerings 
our acquisitions of loud in january and industria in october provided us with complementary aerospace component and subassembly manufacturing capabilities 
in february  we acquired two businesses hale hamilton and its subsidiary cambridge fluid systems  a leading provider of high pressure valves and flow control equipment  and sagebrush which provides pipeline flow control and measurement equipment to oil and gas markets 
in july  we purchased the assets of sei  a leader in the design of pneumatic controls and inflation systems for the aerospace  marine  defense  and industrial markets 
regarding our financial results  we had a record year in a number of respects 
customer orders increased over whereas revenues rose over net income and diluted earnings per share were the highest ever for circor  net income rose over to million and diluted earnings per share increased to 
we enter with the highest backlog ever to begin a new year  at million 
these results can be largely attributed to the robust worldwide spending in the oil and gas markets 
while our energy products segment achieved record revenues and near record operating margins  the profitability of our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment continued to be constrained by production difficulties from operational changes  higher stainless steel costs and a significant increase in our asbestos related costs at our leslie facility  compared to in response to these issues  we have strengthened our supplier management processes and expanded our international sourcing programs 
we have also strengthened our management teams  continued our lean manufacturing improvement initiatives with a focus on manufacturing constraints  and initiated further facility consolidations 
these counter measures helped our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment report nearly sequential operating margin improvement after the first quarter  exiting with fourth quarter operating margin of  excluding the basis point effect from the million accrual for asbestos related open claims against leslie controls 
during  we expect to show improved profitability within the instrumentation and thermal fluid control products segment 
regarding cash flow  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  or of revenues  an increase of million compared to million generated in the increase from resulted from greater profitability and more efficient use of working capital compared to we also used million of cash for investing activities and million in financing activities  specifically million was used for net payments on our revolving line of credit 
as of december   we believe we remain a well capitalized company with total debt to total capitalization of 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the 
table of contents week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
except for income taxes and a change in the measurement of pension liabilities  there have been no significant changes from the methodology applied by management for critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in our annual report on form k 
the methodology applied to management s estimate for income taxes has changed due to the implementation of a new accounting pronouncement as described below and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for inventory we typically analyze our inventory aging and projected future usage on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of our inventory allowances 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand is one of the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  
table of contents we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
purchase accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies and we typically utilize third party valuation firms to assist in the valuation of certain tangible and intangible assets 
we accrue estimates for certain costs  related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings  anticipated at the date of acquisition  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
business combinations and emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
adjustments to these estimates are made during the acquisition allocation period  which is generally up to twelve months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized 
subsequent to the allocation period  costs incurred in excess of the recorded acquisition accruals are generally expensed as incurred and if accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the acquired entity  usually decreasing goodwill 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies and guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i  item impairment analysis as required by sfas no  goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual assessment as to whether there was an indication that goodwill and certain intangible assets are impaired 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
our policy is to perform 
table of contents impairment tests for each reporting unit on goodwill and certain intangible assets on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  if triggering events indicate impairment may have occurred 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit  and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges 
when the estimated future cash flows are expected to be less than the carrying value of the assets of the reporting unit being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was compared with million as of december  the amounts of our non amortizing intangible assets were million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of our goodwill in   or in the fourth quarter  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the estimated indemnity costs to resolve open asbestos claims filed against leslie controls  which is reported in our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment 
as a result of the evolving factors associated with leslie control s asbestos matters  our outlook of diminished future cash flow for leslie controls was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of leslie control s in accordance with sfas no 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of our year end closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  led us to conclude that the fair value of leslie control s long lived assets was at least equal to net book value  and no impairment charge was necessary 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of research and product development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion  domestic manufacturing deduction  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax liabilities decreased primarily due to the reversal of prior depreciation differences and amortization relating to non goodwill intangibles 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses and inventory reserves 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained a total valuation allowance of million at december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of certain foreign tax credits  state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based 
table of contents on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which became effective for us beginning in fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the result of the company s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
the company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision 
during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million in interest 
as of december   accrued interest and penalties were million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
for additional information regarding the adoption of fin  see income taxes in note  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we maintain two pension benefit plans  a qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan that covers substantially all of our salaried and hourly non union employees in the united states  and a nonqualified  noncontributory defined benefit supplemental plan that provides benefits to certain highly compensated officers and employees 
to date  the supplemental plan remains an unfunded plan 
these plans include 
table of contents significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation 
as of july   in connection with a revision to our retirement plan  we froze the pension benefits of our qualified noncontributory plan participants 
under the revised plan  such participants generally do not accrue any additional benefits under the defined benefit plan after july  and will instead receive enhanced benefits associated with our defined contribution k plan in which substantially all of our us employees are eligible to participate 
effective december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize in their balance sheets the over funded or under funded status of defined benefit post retirement plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date 
we adopted the measurement provisions of sfas beginning january  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 we accounted for our pension benefit plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded the combined fair value of plan assets and accumulated pension cost 
any adjustment was recorded as a non cash charge to other comprehensive income in shareholders equity deficit 
sfas no 
required that the liability recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post retirement benefit plans through other comprehensive income loss 
assets of our qualified pension plan are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor in the plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for and for the qualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expense for was compared to for the period of january  through june  and for the period from july  through december  for the nonqualified plan  the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was compared to in the qualified plan was remeasured on march  due to freeze in pension benefits after july  which has resulted in multiple discount rates for different periods in for the qualified plan 
the 
table of contents effect of the discount rate changes for lowered our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and lowered our pension expense by approximately million 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are being recognized over approximately a ten year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
the fair value of our defined benefit plan assets at december  was less than the estimated projected benefit obligations 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our benefit plans 
during  we did not make any cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
in  we do not expect to make voluntary cash contributions  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
we derive our discount rate utilizing a commonly known pension discount curve  discounting future projected benefit obligation cash flows to arrive at a single equivalent rate 
for  we utilized as our discount rate for our pension plans on a weighted average basis given the level of yield on corporate bond interest rates 
the effect of the change in the assumed discount rate is expected to lower our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and has virtually no impact on pension expense 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 

table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following tables set forth the results of operations  percentage of net revenue and the period to period percentage change in certain financial data for the year ended december  and december  year ended december  december  change dollars in thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges  n m operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense  net  n m total other expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenue net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following segment year ended total change acquisitions divestiture operations foreign exchange december  december  in thousands instrumentation thermal fluids control energy total the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the energy products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
this segment s customer orders increased in compared to  excluding a small business sold in business units in this segment benefited from higher volumes and selling prices 
revenue increased an incremental million from the february acquisition of hale hamilton which complemented this segment s sales to general industrial  power generation  aerospace  and chemical processing end markets 
the increase in on net revenues is also net of a decrease of revenues from our december sale of the small  break even french business  soci t alsacienne regulaves thermiques von rohr  sa sart  which had million of revenue in this segment s year to date revenues also included a million increase due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
in  we expect market conditions to remain steady for most of the general industrial  commercial hvac  power generation  and aerospace end markets served by this segment 
excluding any acquisitions in this segment  we expect a revenue increase in this segment approximating for the full year compared energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was the net result of an incremental million from organic increases in revenues which included million for large international projects and fabricated systems in north america and the balance from standard products sold through distribution 
the total organic revenue increase resulted from an escalation in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas that has motivated producers to increase their drilling  production  and distribution facilities 
this segment s revenues for standard products sold through distribution declined in the second half of due to lower orders resulting from wet weather conditions in the midwest in june and july and by distributors normalizing their stocking levels  after over buying from manufacturers during and early due to tight supply of products 
we expect our distributors to have completed their re balancing of inventories by the first quarter of revenues in also increased an incremental million from the february acquisition of sagebrush which produces fabricated measuring  metering  and control sub systems for pipeline applications in the north america oil and gas markets 
this segment s revenues also included a million increase due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the increase in end market demand resulted in this segment s customer backlog being higher as of december   compared to the same period last year and nearly equivalent to the end of the third quarter of looking forward  after three successive years in which this segment s organic sales growth was nearly per year  we expect the energy products segment to have full year sales growth approximating to compared to gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for consolidated gross margin of for was an increase of basis points from gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross profit increased on higher unit volume increases related to market growth and selective customer price increases  however  these increases were partially offset by higher costs 
the higher costs included 
table of contents continuing higher raw material costs  especially brass  stainless steel and other nickel based alloys  and we were not able to fully offset these additional costs via higher prices to customers 
also  with higher capacity utilization at critical vendors  we spent additional amounts to counteract decreased vendor responsiveness and lengthened lead times to receive certain critical parts 
further  we experienced lower factory productivity from re organizing production flow in three of this segment s us plants 
measures enacted to counter these factors include outsourcing and foreign sourcing to lower the cost of goods sold  focusing lean manufacturing priorities to achieve more linear and efficient production levels  and ensuring predictable flow of inventory from global suppliers 
one result of counter measures taken was the closing in the first quarter of of a us plant with similar production now being sourced from asian suppliers 
this plant closing resulted in a special charge cost in of million  of which million was recorded in each of the first two quarters of the annual savings of this closure and foreign sourcing counter measure is expected to be million 
gross profit for the energy products segment increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase included an incremental million from the february acquisition of sagebrush and million increase in gross profit due to higher foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
the remainder of the increase resulted from operational improvements higher unit shipments to meet the strong global demand  customer price increases  and further increases in foreign sourcing which helped to lower cost of goods sold and improved linearity in production activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for  a decrease of basis points from selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by million over which was due to increased litigation costs associated with asbestos related claims  higher foreign exchange rates for the euro and pound sterling  higher personnel related costs at certain locations  and the incremental impact from our acquisition of hale hamilton  offset by million of costs for our sart business divested in december the increased litigation costs included a net million charge related to an accrual for estimated indemnity costs to resolve open asbestos claims for our leslie facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy products segment increased only million despite its revenue growth 
this increase was due to higher foreign exchange rates for the euro  incremental expense from our february acquisition of sagebrush  and higher commissions 
corporate  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily from higher benefit costs and professional fees 

table of contents special charges special charges of million were recorded in the year ended december  these charges include million related to costs associated with the company s ceo and cfo retirement agreements  specifically the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards  million pertaining to severance and facility costs primarily from closing a facility located in connecticut within the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls segment  and a million net gain related to the sale of facilities classified as held for sale within the energy products segment 
for the year ended december   special charges of million were recognized including a pension curtailment charge of million incurred in connection with the freeze of our qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan and million related to a write down of an asset classified as held for sale 
operating income the change in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows year ended total change acquisitions divestiture operations foreign exchange segment december  december  in thousands instrumentation thermal fluid controls energy corporate total operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for  on a increase in revenues in operating income for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment decreased million to million compared to the year ended december  while revenues increased  operating margin declined as our businesses in this segment were hampered by higher raw material costs  especially stainless steel and brass  manufacturing inefficiencies  and costs to counteract decreased vendor responsiveness and increased litigation costs associated with asbestos related claims 
the french business  sart  which was sold in december  had recorded a million profit for the period owned by us 
operating income for the energy products segment increased million  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in operating margins increased basis points to on a revenue increase of  compared to the energy products segment increased operating income benefited from a higher volume of shipments  price increases to customers  further foreign sourcing that reduced cost of goods sold as well as the incremental contribution from our acquisition of sagebrush 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million to million for compared to million for the decrease in interest expense  net was primarily due to million lower outstanding balance of our senior unsecured notes that were fully paid in october and steadily reduced borrowings during against our revolving credit facility 
other income  net other income  net was a million gain for the year ended december  compared to million expense in the same period of the difference in the amounts of other income was largely the gain on the sale of an investment in a small european business within our instrumentation and thermal fluid control products segment for million 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of the rate increase was the net result of the expiration of the extraterritorial income exclusion in  proportionally greater income in from higher taxed jurisdictions partially offset by revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of in foreign tax law and lower statutory rates in germany  the united kingdom and italy 
net income net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for this increase is primarily attributable to increased profitability of our energy products segment  incremental contributions from two acquisitions in february  gains from the sale of a small european business and a former site in china  and lower interest expense partially offset by higher production  selling  and asbestos related litigation costs incurred by a subsidiary in our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment and higher corporate expenses

table of contents instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
revenues increased an incremental million from the february acquisition of hale hamilton and by million from the acquisition of industria in october the two acquisitions were complemented by organic increases in product sales to general industrial  power generation  aerospace  and chemical processing end markets 
incoming customer orders increased  excluding hale hamilton and industria  and benefited nearly every business unit  and many of our businesses benefited from higher selling prices 
in  management expects market conditions to remain steady for most of the general industrial  chemical processing and aerospace end markets served by this segment 
energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the net result of an incremental million from the february acquisition of sagebrush 
the added revenues from the sagebrush acquisition were complemented by additional organic increases in revenues as an escalation in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas motivated producers to increase their drilling  production  and distribution facilities 
organic revenues from our north american operations increased million over  and our italian subsidiary  pibiviesse  increased its revenues million over pibiviesse continues to be successful in winning and fulfilling orders for large international oil and gas projects  a majority of which are for national energy companies in the middle east 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  consolidated gross margin of for the year ended december  was a decrease of basis points from the prior year period 
gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year and was primarily the result of million of incremental gross profit from the february acquisition of hale hamilton 
at our ongoing businesses  gross profit increased on higher unit volume increases related to market growth and selective customer price increases  however  these increases were offset by higher costs 
the higher costs included continuing higher raw material costs  especially stainless steel and nickel based alloys  and we were not able to fully offset these additional costs via higher prices to customers 
also  with higher capacity utilization at critical vendors  we spent additional amounts in to counteract decreased vendor responsiveness and lengthened lead times to receive certain critical parts 
further  we experienced lower factory productivity from re organizing production flow in three of this segment s us plants 
measures being enacted to counter these factors include outsourcing and foreign sourcing to lower the cost of goods sold  focusing lean manufacturing priorities to achieve more linear and efficient production levels  and ensuring predictable flow of inventory from global suppliers 
gross profit for the energy products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the gross profit increase was the net effect of million from higher sales by existing business units and million from the acquisition of 
table of contents sagebrush 
the operational improvements that have led to the increase in gross profit from our ongoing businesses included higher unit shipments to meet the strong global demand  customer price increases  savings from facility consolidations in  further increases in foreign sourcing which helped to lower cost of goods sold  and improved linearity in production activities

in addition  certain of our ongoing businesses invested in sales efforts and product engineering in to pursue sales prospects in fast growing geographies and key customer projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy products segment increased million  including million of incremental expense from our february acquisition of sagebrush 
this segment also incurred higher commissions and selling expense related to its nearly organic revenue growth and its near record backlog of million as of december  corporate general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million the prior year 
the majority of the net increase from was from higher stock based compensation costs 
we adopted the new accounting pronouncement  fas r effective january   requiring the expensing of stock options 
the impact of this new accounting pronouncement was an additional pretax expense of million or per diluted share in we also incurred an incremental pretax cost of million or per diluted share for restricted share units granted in other corporate expense increases for staffing were offset by reductions in consulting fees  variable compensation costs and audit fees 
special charges special charges of million were recognized for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the special charges recognized as of year ended december  related to a pension curtailment charge of million incurred in connection with the freeze of our qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan  and in our energy products segment  severance charges of million incurred in closing an assembly operation and million related to a write down of an asset classified as held for sale

based on our expected cash flows from operations  available credit facilities  and ability to further leverage the balance sheet  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund working capital needs and future growth 
we continue to search for strategic acquisitions in the flow control market 
a larger acquisition may require additional borrowings and or the issuance of our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime 
table of contents markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity risk as of december   our primary interest rate risk is related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our industrial revenue bond 
the interest rates for our revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bond fluctuate with changes in short term borrowing rates 
we had million borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of december  based upon expected levels of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in and our current balance for our industrial revenue bond  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would have an effect on our annual results of operations and cash flows of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses are recognized when hedged transactions affect earnings  which are generally in the same period as the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   we had forward contracts to sell currencies with a face value of approximately million 
the net unrealized losses attributable to foreign currency forward contracts at december  were less than million 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
our risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties is not significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation
