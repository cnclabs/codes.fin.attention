management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents a review of the major factors that have affected the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of britton koontz capital corporation the company and its subsidiaries  principally britton koontz bank  na the bank  as of and for the three years ended december  summary in  the company reported net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  representing a decrease of  or thousand  compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  reported at december   and a decrease compared to net income of million  or and per basic and diluted share  reported at december  return on average equity for the years  and was  and  respectively 
net interest margins increased to at december   from at december  and at december  the company s decision to limit the volume of residential mortgages retained in its own portfolio and to allow residential mortgage loans already booked to pay down limited overall loan growth in loan growth was generated primarily in the baton rouge market  which experienced better economic conditions than those in the company s vicksburg and natchez markets 
in baton rouge  the company s lending was focused primarily on commercial real estate financing  and the company expects such financing to remain the dominant type of lending for the bank in its baton rouge market 
the company anticipates that deposit gathering in the future will be bolstered by our sale of new financial products such as remote deposit  internet banking and commercial cash management services 
we believe that the more urban baton rouge market in particular presents an excellent opportunity for the company to sell these new products 
the company took steps in to position the company for future growth in its deposit gathering 
for example  personnel recruitment included the hiring of a chief deposit officer  a veteran banker with extensive treasury management sales experience 
this hiring accounts for a portion of the increase in personnel costs for to increase its physical presence in the area and to facilitate access to the bank services  the company intends to expand in the baton rouge market 
in  the company intends to acquire two new sites in baton rouge to supplement the company s approximate square foot full service branch office in baton rouge on bluebonnet boulevard 
company plans are to begin construction of a new branch on one of the sites in with construction of the second site beginning in early to mid capital expenditures and the associated operating expenses incurred in connection with this expansion will likely dampen net income over the next to months  although the company expects that additional loans and deposits resulting from our expansion will generate additional income for the company 
in addition  the impact from the increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses will be somewhat offset by the decline of depreciation expense on existing plant and equipment 
the company s strategy in baton rouge continues the focus on commercial lending  reflected both in the company product emphasis and recruitment of personnel 
the company believes that the products and services it offers in the baton rouge market are competitive with those offered by competing institutions but that its single physical location limits the demand for the company s retail services in the market 
the company does expect to increase its mortgage originations in all markets 
in recent years  the company has not actively participated in sub prime market products 
although this has resulted in the lower loan origination volumes  the company does not expect to be severely impacted by the downturn in the subprime market 
at the same time  the company believes that greater regulatory supervision of the delivery systems for mortgages arising in response to the recent market excesses will actually improve the opportunities for the company  which has traditionally operated within conservative mortgage parameters 
financial condition assets during  total assets decreased thousand to million at december  the change is due primarily to a decrease of million in loans  which ended at million  offset by an million increase in investment securities to million 
nearly of the decrease in loans occurred in the residential portfolio 
during  total assets decreased  or million to million from million at december  the decline in assets was primarily due to the redirection of cash flows from both the investment portfolio and the residential mortgage portfolio into new commercial loans and the reduction in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings
