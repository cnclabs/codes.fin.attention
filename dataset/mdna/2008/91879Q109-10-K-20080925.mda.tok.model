overview the company s operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate  which represented  and  respectively  of the company s net revenue for the year ended july  the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of five ski resort properties as well as ancillary businesses  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
mountain segment revenue is seasonal in nature  the majority of which is earned in the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of nine luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including five proximate to the company s ski resorts  ii the ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to the company s ski resorts  iii gtlc  and iv golf courses 
the resort segment is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around the company s resort communities 
the company s single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i out of state and international guests destination and ii in state and local visitors in state 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised an estimated of the company s skier visits  while the in state market comprised an estimated of the company s skier visits 
destination guests generally purchase the company s higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental as well as the lodging at or around the company s resorts 
destination guests are less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  due to the advance planning required for their trip  but can be impacted by general economic conditions and the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more weather sensitive and value oriented  to address this  the company markets season passes to in state guests  generally prior to the start of the ski season 
approximately  and of the total lift revenue was comprised of season pass revenue for the  and ski seasons  respectively 
the cost structure of ski resort operations once a certain level of visitation is achieved is largely fixed with the exception of certain variable expenses including forest service fees  other resort related fees  credit card fees  retail rental operations  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  incremental revenue generally has high associated profit margin 
lodging properties at or around the company s ski resorts represented approximately  and of the lodging segment net revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively  and are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests 
revenue generated through management fees is based upon the revenue of managed individual hotel properties within the lodging portfolio  and to the extent that these managed properties are not proximate to ski resorts  the seasonality of those hotels more closely resembles the seasonality and trends within the overall travel industry 
revenue of the lodging segment during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s peak operating season occurs during the summer months  as well as golf operations and operations from the company s other owned and managed properties 
the company s real estate segment primarily engages in both the vertical development of projects and to a lesser degree the sale of land to third party developers  which latter activity generally includes the retention of some involvement and control in the infrastructure  development  oversight and design of the projects and a contingent revenue structure based on the ultimate sale of the developed units 
the company attempts to mitigate the risk of vertical development by utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the project  which generally requires significant non refundable deposits  and obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects 
the company s real estate development projects also may result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the resort segment 
the company s real estate revenue and associated expense fluctuate based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  thus increasing the volatility of real estate operating results between periods 
in the near term  the majority of real estate revenue is expected to be generated from vertical development projects that are currently under construction  in which revenue and related cost of sales will be recorded at the time of real estate closings 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on skier visits 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on sales of season passes prior to the beginning of the season to in state skiers  who the company believes are the most weather sensitive visitors to the company s ski resorts 
additionally  the company has invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations throughout the ski season 
total season pass revenue for the and the ski seasons increased by and over revenue for the prior ski seasons  respectively 
in march  the company announced a new season pass product the epic season pass for the upcoming ski season  which offers unrestricted and unlimited access to the company s five ski resorts 
the epic season pass is being marketed towards the company s destination guests although is also available to in state guests and must be purchased on or before november   prior to the vast majority of the ski season 
as such  the company expects an increase in season pass revenue for the ski season  however  the company cannot predict the overall impact the epic season pass will have on overall lift revenue and etp 
the economic downturn currently affecting the us economy combined with higher energy costs may continue to have a negative impact on overall trends in the travel and leisure industries 
consequently  visitation to the company s resorts and or the amount the company s guests spend at its resorts may be negatively impacted by the weaker us economy  in addition to potential lowered demand for the company s real estate projects 
consistent with prior years  the company plans to raise prices on the majority of its lift ticket products  including season pass products  for the ski season and continues to charge some of the highest prices in the industry 
while pricing increases historically have not reduced demand  there can be no assurances that demand will remain price inelastic 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of the company s operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities  therefore many of the company s on mountain capital improvements must go through an approval process 
changes or impacts to the applicable regulatory environment may have detrimental effects on the company 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
additionally  the magnitude of real estate projects currently under development or contemplated could result in significant fluctuations in real estate reported ebitda between periods 
for example  the company closed on of the units at the arrabelle at vail square arrabelle during the year ended july  and expects to close on the remaining condominium units during the year ending july  the company closed on five of the lodge at vail chalets chalets during the year ended july  and expects to close on the remaining chalets during the year ending july  additionally  the company expects to close on a vast majority  if not all of the units at crystal peak lodge during the year ending july  the company has entered into definitive sales contracts with a value of approximately million related to these projects of which million of revenue was recognized in the year ended july   along with the associated cost of sales 
the company has several other real estate projects across its resorts under development and in the planning stages 
while the current instability in the capital markets and slowdown in the national real estate market have not  to date  materially impacted the company s real estate development  the company does have elevated risk associated with the selling and or closing of its real estate under development as a result of the current economic climate 
these risks surrounding the company s real estate developments are partially mitigated by the fact that the company s projects include a relatively low number of luxury and ultra luxury units situated at the base of its resorts  which are unique due to the relatively low supply of developable land 
additionally  the company s real estate projects must meet the company s pre sale requirements  which include substantial non refundable deposits  before significant development begins  however  there is no guarantee that a sustained downward trend in the capital and real estate markets would not materially impact the company s real estate development activities or operating results 
in addition to the expected completion of the arrabelle  chalets and crystal peak lodge development projects during the year ending july   the company is also moving forward with the development of one ski hill place located at the base of peak in breckenridge and the ritz carlton residences  vail 
the company expects to incur between million to million of development costs subsequent to july  on the remaining chalets  crystal peak lodge  one ski hill place and the ritz carlton residences  vail projects 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  with no borrowings under the revolver component of its credit facility and expects to generate additional cash from operations  including future closures on real estate vertical development projects during the fiscal year 
in addition to building excess cash  the company continuously evaluates how to utilize its excess cash  including any combination of the following strategic options self fund real estate under development  continue recent levels of investment in resort assets  pursue strategic acquisitions  pay off outstanding debt  repurchase additional common stock of the company see note  stock repurchase plan  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s stock repurchase plan  and or other options to return value to stockholders 
the company s debt is long term in nature and the company believes its debt has favorable interest rates 
in determining its uses of excess cash  the company has some constraints as a result of the company s fourth amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of january   as amended  between the vail corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  bank of america  na as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto the credit agreement underlying the company s credit facility and the indenture  governing the notes  which limit the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase stock and pay off certain of its debt  including its notes 
on june   the company and east west resort transportation holdings llc entered into a definitive agreement whereby the company will acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of colorado mountain express cme  a ground transportation related business 
the purchase price is approximately million  net of certain working capital and other adjustments 
the acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals and certain other closing conditions 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of the fiscal year ending july  the company uses many methods  estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead the company to change its methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect the company s results of operations

in order to provide additional flexibility for the company s liquidity needs  the company finalized in march an agreement with the lenders in its credit facility to utilize an accordion feature to expand commitments under the existing facility by million for a total borrowing capacity of million  at the same terms existing in the current facility 
the company believes the credit facility  which matures in  including the expanded commitments would provide added flexibility especially when evaluating future financing needs for its real estate projects given the current state of the non recourse financing available in the capital markets  and is priced favorably  with any new borrowings currently being priced at libor plus 
in addition to building excess cash  the company continuously evaluates how to utilize its excess cash  including any combination of the following strategic options self funded real estate under development  continue recent levels of investment in resort assets  pursue strategic acquisitions  pay off outstanding debt  repurchase additional common stock of the company and or other options to return value to stockholders 
the company s debt generally has favorable fixed interest rates and is long term in nature 
the company s credit facility and the indenture limit the company s ability to make investments or distributions  including the payment of dividends and or the repurchase of the company s common stock  and the pay off of certain of its debt  including its notes 
significant uses of cash the company s cash needs typically include providing for operating expenditures  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for both assets to be used in operations and real estate development projects 
in addition  the company expects it will incur a significant increase in cash income tax payments for the next two to three years due to the utilization of all nol carryforwards previously available to offset taxable income subject to the appeal of the irs ruling described above  real estate under development and an estimated decline in tax benefits resulting from stock award exercises

the company has not finalized its real estate development plan for calendar year the company obtained non recourse financing to partially fund construction of arrabelle and chalets projects 
in addition to utilizing project specific financing and cash on hand as appropriate  the company also pre sells units requiring deposits in a proposed development prior to committing to the completion of the development 
the company has historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for its resort operations  and expects to continue to invest significant cash in the future 
the company evaluates additional capital improvements based on expected strategic impacts and or expected return on investment 
the company currently anticipates it will spend approximately million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar year excluding resort depreciable assets arising from real estate activities noted above  of which million was spent as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar year this overall resort capital investment will allow the company to maintain its high quality standards and make incremental discretionary improvements at the company s five ski resorts and throughout its owned hotels

excluding payments of amounts due under non recourse real estate financing million  which are expected to be made utilizing proceeds from the applicable real estate closings  the company has a total of million of principal payments due over the next five fiscal years on its current debt outstanding 
interest payments under the company s debt will be approximately million in the year ending july   assuming the debt remains at its current level and assuming current interest rates 
the company s debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause the company s annual interest payments to change by approximately million 
the fluctuation in the company s debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under its credit facility or other alternative financing arrangements  including non recourse real estate financings  it may enter into 
the company s long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under the credit facility  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
the company can manage changes in the business and economic environment by managing its capital expenditures and real estate development activities

acquisitions under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors

the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit facility covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  minimum net worth and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  the company s financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in its credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while the company anticipates that it would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require the company to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
the company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the company s audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate revenue and cost of sales 
description the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units sold within a project  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the determination of cost of sales may utilize estimates for the value of resort depreciable assets that may be part of a mixed use real estate development project and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either the relative sales values of the components of a project  which may include resort depreciable assets  or the total projected costs to be incurred to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels or units within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates of either the relative sales values of the components of a project or remaining costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method would have changed the profit margin recognized by approximately million for the year ended july  intangible assets 
description the company acquires intangible assets  including goodwill  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the assistance of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values and lives  when applicable  could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas  discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment under sfas as of may  or whenever events may indicate a possible impairment exists 
additionally  future operating results could trigger significant future non cash impairment charges 
judgments and uncertainties the company determines fair value using current market values and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and a royalty rate model 
these types of analyses require the company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding economic factors and the future operating results of certain business operations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company completed the annual impairment testing of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the year ended july   which resulted in no impairment being recorded  using the methodology described herein 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit associated with goodwill and or fair value of the intangible assets tested would not have had a significant impact on the test results 
tax contingencies 
description on august   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
see note in the notes of consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires the company to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which the company may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
the irs has completed its examination of the company s tax returns for tax years through and has issued a report of its findings 
the examiner s primary finding is the disallowance of the company s position to remove the restrictions under section of the internal revenue code of approximately million of nol carryforwards 
these restricted nol carryforwards relate to fresh start accounting from the company s reorganization in the company has appealed the examiner s disallowance of these nol carryforwards to the office of appeals 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with the company s various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and it has adequate reserves for its tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in the company s tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable and or adjustments to its deferred tax assets  liabilities or intangible assets in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets 
description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or the company could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s useful life of the assets contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended july  new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  the company s fiscal year ending july  
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november  the company s fiscal year ending july  and interim periods within the fiscal year of adoption 
the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company is currently evaluating the impacts  if any  the adoption of the provisions of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas gives the company the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  the company s fiscal year ending july  
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r will be applicable prospectively to business combinations consummated after july  the company s fiscal year ending july  
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity within the balance sheet 
currently  noncontrolling interests minority interests are reported as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the related income loss attributable to minority interests is reflected as an expense credit in arriving at net income 
upon adoption of sfas  the company will be required to report its minority interests as a separate component of stockholders equity and present net income allocable to the minority interests along with net income attributable to the stockholders of the company separately in its consolidated statement of operations 
sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of sfas shall be applied prospectively 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  the company s fiscal year ending july  
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and the company s owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses 
revenue and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from certain managed properties  certain other lodging properties and golf operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during the year ended july   of total combined mountain and lodging segment net revenue was earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during the year ended july  of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor will cause the company s annual interest payments to change by million 
the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
