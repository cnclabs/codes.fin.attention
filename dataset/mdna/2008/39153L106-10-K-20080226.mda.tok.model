financial overview was an extraordinary year in many respects and difficult in others 
despite a sluggish crm market  we achieved record sales of million for the year  an increase of over last year 
excluding the million of revenue that was contributed by our acquisitions  we achieved an growth rate year over year 
our earnings per share for totaled  which included per share for ipr d charges  per share for other non recurring acquisition related charges and per share related to our cost savings and consolidation initiatives 
results benefited from a per share gain related to the exchange of a portion of our long term debt during the year and a per share gain from the sale of an investment security 
earnings per share for amounted to and included per share related to our cost savings and consolidation initiatives 
we completed five acquisitions in and two in the first two months of these acquisitions were enabled by our strong cash position and financing activities in the first half of we conducted an exchange offering for approximately million of our old convertible notes  which extended the effective maturity from to at the same time  we issued an additional million in new convertible notes 
additionally  in may we entered into a new credit facility which included a million revolving line of credit  which can be increased to million upon our request 
as of year end our cash and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at the end of during  we spent approximately million on the five acquisitions mentioned above 
our cash on hand and our availability under our line of credit are sufficient to meet our operating and investment activities for the foreseeable future  including our investment of approximately million on the orthopedics acquisitions completed in the beginning of ceo message over the past year  we have focused our strategic initiatives on creating a platform that can support additional growth 
we remain steadfast in our mission of being a leader in the comprehensive design and manufacturing of technology based custom products for the commercial and implantable medical markets 
we are poised to continue growing through innovation and strategic acquisitions that broaden our technology and market base 
in  we operated primarily in the crm and commercial power markets 
as we moved into  our focus shifted to the diversification and globalization of greatbatch 
early in the year  we put in place over million of available financing to facilitate this growth 
this facilitated our acquisition of five companies in and two in early  each complementing our existing business model and adding to our capabilities 
these investments helped move us into new vertical markets while expanding our presence geographically 
to enhance our technological prowess and complement our growing medical operations  we purchased biomec in april with specialties in infection and clotting control  biomec provides us with enhanced design service capability and extends our customer reach from device concept through commercial manufacturing 
with biomec  we obtained a minority ownership in intellect medical  which has provided us with the important clinical relationships that improve our presence in the neurostimulation market 
in june  we acquired enpath 
enpath enhances our current imc business by providing a platform to enter into the vascular market and broaden our neurostimulation markets 
it also allows us to expand our current product offerings to existing customers and leverage a proprietary product portfolio 
with quan emerteq  we added substantial critical mass to the vascular product offerings acquired from enpath 
in addition  approximately of quan emerteq s sales come from crm and neurostimulation products  which further strengthen our position with current customers in these markets 
quan emerteq also helps us enter the growing peripheral  coronary and neurovascular markets 
together  quan emerteq s and enpath s capabilities create the basis for our therapy delivery product line 
with the inception of our therapy delivery business we are now developing new products such as leadwires for the crm and neurostimulation markets  and introducers  catheters and delivery systems for the vascular market 
we also entered the orthopedics market in early by acquiring precimed and the follow on acquisition of depuy s chaumont  france manufacturing facility 
these acquisitions provided us with a major european manufacturing presence and multiple product offerings including trays  instruments and implants 
electrochem  our commercial subsidiary  showed significant growth in to build on that momentum  we expanded electrochem s capabilities to include battery powered wireless sensing solutions  with the acquisition of intellisensing 
this acquisition works well with our current oil and gas product offering and enables us to better serve our customers through a more comprehensive solution 
in addition  we plan to leverage our wireless sensor capabilities into the medical market in the near future 
eac was added to complement our commercial division as well 
eac designs and manufactures rechargeable battery pack solutions for customers in the external medical  communication  automatic data collection  and environmental and safety markets 
eac allows us to increase product offerings to our existing commercial customers and allows for expansion into the growing external medical market 
it also increases our primary cell capabilities to include rechargeable batteries and design solutions 
while diversifying our markets  we simultaneously expanded geographically 
through our acquisitions  we added eleven new locations throughout the world 
our newly developed presence in six us cities  switzerland  france  china  japan and the united kingdom better equips us to serve existing customers while pursuing untapped markets 
i consider the positive impact our growth has had on our customers to be a significant accomplishment 
with new vertical markets and expanded offerings in crm and commercial  we are able not only to develop new customers but also to offer current customers a more comprehensive product portfolio 
our measures to diversify has brought many new faces to greatbatch over the past year and helped to reposition the responsibilities of several long standing leadership team members 
our organizational restructuring has led to the creation of a strong management team  one that will be responsible for leading greatbatch into and beyond 
with a platform focused on integration  our business leaders will not only work to strengthen their units  but together  work to improve the overall strength of greatbatch

our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective

identifiable intangible assets such as purchased technology  patents and customer lists are reviewed at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life indefinite lived intangible assets such as trademarks and tradenames are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach

we have pricing arrangements with our customers that at times do not specify minimum order quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
our customers may have inventory management programs and alternate supply arrangements of which we are unaware 
additionally  the relative market share among the oem device manufacturers changes periodically 
consequently  these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period 
we achieved year over year growth of in our imc business despite our underlying markets growing at a low single digit pace and an approximate net reduction in selling prices 
our acquisitions represented a increase in imc revenue 
icd capacitors  icd batteries  assembly products and coated electrodes were the primary growth drivers 
icd capacitor sales increased due to a non recurring customer supply issue in the first half of the year 
growth in icd batteries was primarily due to increased sales of our q technology battery which was introduced near the end of  partially offset by lower prices 
this growth represents increased adoption of our high rate battery technology 
we expect pricing pressure from our larger customers to continue in the future 
consistent with our strategy to increase the integration of our component products including enclosures into our assembly business  assembly revenues  which are included in other imc revenue  increased by in correspondingly  revenues from enclosures decreased by over the same period 
in addition to the above  the increase in assembly sales reflected an increase in price due to contractual agreements related to material price increases 
ecp 
similar to imc customers  we have pricing arrangements with our customers that many times do not specify minimum quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time as most customers utilize short term purchase orders as opposed to long term contracts 
ecp sales grew by in through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions  greater value added pack assembly and acquisitions 
our acquisitions represented a increase in ecp revenue 
the core growth rate slowed from the prior year partially due to the favorable benefit of approximately to million in customer inventory stocking in as it consolidated operations 
the oil and gas exploration market remains robust due to the increased demand for products used in pipeline inspections  pressure monitoring and measurement while drilling applications 
in addition  our presence in the rechargeable cells market will provide incremental sales opportunities 
sales outlook including the acquisitions in and early  we expect our full year sales will be in the range of million to million 
our newly acquired therapy delivery and orthopedic companies are forecasting to growth over their previous year results  respectively 
we have assumed an underlying crm market growth rate of for next year 
cost of sales excluding amortization of intangible assets changes from the prior year to cost of sales as a percentage of sales  excluding the amortization of intangible assets  were primarily due to the following increase price reduction a inventory step up b excess capacity at columbia facility c total percentage point change to cost of sales as a percentage of sales a 
this increase was primarily due to contractual price concessions negotiated with our larger customers 
price reductions were negotiated in exchange for longer term commitments  primarily in the imc segment 
b 
in connection with our acquisitions  the value of inventory on hand was stepped up to reflect the fair value at the time of acquisition 
the inventory step up amortization  which is recorded as cost of sales excluding intangible amortization  was million 
as of december   million of inventory step up is remaining to be amortized  which does not include the value of the inventory step up related to the acquisitions in early c 
the columbia facility was operating with excess capacity during as its production transitioned to our tijuana  mexico facility 
the excess capacity cost is approximately million 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  excess capacity costs are expensed 
we expect cost of sales as a percentage of sales to benefit in future years due to our consolidation efforts and the elimination of excess capacity  partially offset by a continuing shift in product mix towards lower margin products 
cost of sales amortization of intangible assets amortization expense for increased from due to an increase in intangible assets acquired as part of the enpath  quan emerteq and eac acquisitions 
the increase represents a partial year of amortization related to our acquisitions 
in  cost of sales amortization of intangible assets is expected to increase to million  due to the full year impact of the acquisitions in and does not include intangible assets that will be recorded in connection with our acquisitions in early sg a expenses changes from the prior year to sg a expenses were primarily due to the following in millions increase headcount increases associated with acquisitions a amortization b increased sales and marketing workforce c increased legal expense d other net increase in sg a a 
personnel working for the acquired companies in functional areas such as finance  human resources and information technology were the primary drivers of this increase 
the remaining increase was for consulting  travel and other administrative expenses to operate these areas 
b 
relates to the amortization of customer relationships and non compete agreements recorded as a result of our acquisitions in c 
the increase in sales and marketing workforce was primarily a result of our planned efforts to increase the marketing and sales of our products 
d 
the increase in legal expense is primarily due to increased staffing levels and activity related to customer contract renewals during the year 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to remain constant in the near term and improve over the long term as synergies from our acquisitions are realized 
rd e expenses net research  development and engineering costs were as follows in millions year ended december  december  research and development costs engineering costs less cost reimbursements engineering costs  net total research and development and engineering costs  net the increase in rd e expenses for was primarily due to the planned headcount increase in engineering personnel as we continue to invest substantial resources in product technologies 
additionally  million of engineering costs were a result of the enpath and biomec acquisitions 
reimbursement on product development projects increased compared to last year primarily due to the timing of the achievement of milestones  as well as the enpath and biomec acquisitions  which added million of cost reimbursements 
reimbursements for achieving certain development milestones are netted against gross spending 
rd e expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to remain constant  reflecting our continued development of and investment in core product technologies 
in the future  cost reimbursements generated from various government grants will be lower as the grants acquired from biomec are scheduled to expire in other operating expenses acquired in process research and development approximately million and million of the biomec and enpath purchase prices  respectively  represent the estimated fair value of ipr d projects acquired from those companies 
these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date  thus were immediately expensed on the date of acquisition 
the ipr d written off in connection with the enpath acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes 
additional information regarding these projects is set forth in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
we are currently in the process of performing a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the companies acquired in at this time  we have not determined if any ipr d charge will result from this valuation

during  we recorded a loss of million related to the write off of a battery test system that was under development 
upon completion of our engineering and technical evaluation  it was determined that the system could not meet the required specifications in a cost effective manner 
this charge was included in the imc business segment 
the remaining expense for includes charges for various asset dispositions and million for professional fees related to a potential acquisition that was no longer considered probable 
in plant relocation and asset disposition expenses are expected to be approximately million to million 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for is higher than the prior year period primarily due to the additional million of convertible notes issued at the end of the first quarter of and additional amortization of deferred fees and discounts associated with these notes and the notes exchanged at that time 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our long term debt obligations 
going forward  interest expense will be higher as a result of the million we borrowed in connection with our acquisitions in early interest income for increased in comparison to primarily due to increased cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  as well as higher rates earned 
in the future  interest income will be lower as a result of the cash deployed in connection with our acquisitions and acquisitions in early gain on sale of investment security in the second quarter of  we sold an investment security which resulted in a pre tax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share 
gain on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of  we exchanged million of our original million of convertible subordinated notes due csn i for an equivalent principal amount of a new series of convertible subordinated notes due the primary purpose of this transaction was to eliminate the june  call and put option that is included in the terms of the exchanged csn i 
we accounted for this exchange as an extinguishment of debt  which resulted in a net pre tax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share 
other income expense  net in december  we entered into a forward contract to purchase  swiss francs chf  at an exchange rate of chf per one us dollar  in order to partially fund our acquisition of precimed  which closed in january and was payable in swiss francs 
in january  we entered into an additional forward contract to purchase  chf at an exchange rate of per one us dollar 
we entered into a similar foreign exchange contract in january in order to fund our acquisition of depuy s chaumont  france facility  which closed in february and was payable in euros 
the net result of the above transactions was a gain of million  million of which was recorded in based upon the fair value of the forward contract at december  as other income and the remainder will be recorded in the first quarter of provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate primarily as a result of the ipr d charge from the acquisition of enpath  which is non deductible for income tax purposes 
as a result  our effective tax rate was in excluding this ipr d charge  our effective tax rate was consistent with we expect our effective tax rate in to be more in line with the us statutory rate 
this excludes the impact of any ipr d charges which may result from our acquisitions 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales we achieved sales growth of in compared to this growth was accomplished during a period in which the underlying crm market  which represents over of our total sales  was in decline 
this growth is even more favorable considering that results include the favorable benefit of approximately million to million in icd marketplace field actions 
another sales highlight for was our ecp business  which grew through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions and greater value added pack assembly 
imc 
we achieved year over year growth of from our medical business 
this growth was accomplished despite the underlying crm market being down compared to the prior year and an approximate reduction in selling prices 
assembly products  feedthroughs  coated electrodes and machined components were the primary growth drivers 
the assembly business was a new opportunity that was launched in the second half of growth in feedthroughs  coated products and machined components represents market share penetration with both our domestic and international customers 
our icd battery product line declined by during  commensurate with the market and the market share shifts among our customers 
the decline in sales was primarily due to lower volume with us based customers and the approximate reduction in selling prices  partially offset by strong european customer sales 
this growth represents increased adoption of our high rate battery technology 
the capacitor business also experienced a decline in sales 
capacitor sales declined by million or  primarily attributable to the actions taken by a single customer in late to further vertically integrate its operations 
ecp 
ecp sales grew by in through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions and greater value added pack assembly 
the oil and gas exploration was robust in due to the increased demand for products used in pipeline inspections  pressure monitoring and measurement while drilling applications 
in addition  our presence in the telematics market provided incremental sales opportunities 
cost of sales changes from the prior year to cost of sales as a percentage of sales were due to the following increase production efficiencies primarily associated with higher volumes a excess capacity at wet tantalum capacitor facility b excess capacity at tijuana  mexico facility c mix change d other total percentage point change to cost of sales as a percentage of sales a 
this decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the fact that as production volumes increase  fixed costs such as plant overhead and depreciation do not increase at the same rate 
the production volume increase was necessary to accommodate the increased sales and to replenish safety stocks 
b 
during  the capacitor facility was not being utilized to its full capacity 
the cost associated with the excess capacity was eliminated in as capacitor manufacturing was consolidated into the alden facility 
c 
the tijuana  mexico facility was new in and its infrastructure and floor space were coming on line during and therefore the full cost of the capacity was not in place 
in  the tijuana facility was on line for the entire year and excess capacity costs in exceeded those in d 
the revenue increase from was primarily in other imc sales  which generally have lower margins 
cost of sales amortization of intangible assets amortization expense for was consistent with sg a expenses changes from the prior year to sg a expenses were primarily due to the following in millions december  sfas no

as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we began expensing stock options in  which had a material impact on sg a costs 
b 
amounts relate to the additional stock based compensation costs recorded in connection with the retirement and replacement of our former ceo and former senior vice president of administration 
these costs were recorded due to acceleration provisions in our executive retirement guidelines as well as costs associated with additional grants awarded to facilitate the transition 
c 
the increase in information technology costs was a result of our continuing investment in the infrastructure of our company in order to support our growth 
d 
the increased workforce expense was primarily a result of our efforts to increase the marketing and sales of our products 
e 
the increase in director fees primarily relates to the adoption of a new director compensation program in this program was designed and approved by the corporate governance committee of the board of directors 
rd e expenses net research  development and engineering costs were as follows in millions year ended december  december  research and development costs engineering costs less cost reimbursements engineering costs  net total research and development and engineering costs  net the increase in rd e expenses for was primarily due to the planned headcount increase in engineering personnel costs  as we continue to invest substantial resources to develop new products

this charge was included in the imc business segment 
the remaining expense for includes charges for various asset dispositions and million for professional fees related to a potential acquisition that was no longer considered probable 
during  a million charge was recorded for the write down of automated cathode assembly equipment for the imc segment 
the remaining expense for relates to various asset dispositions of approximately million and the cost to exit a development agreement of million 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was consistent with  and is primarily related to the contingent convertible notes 
interest income increased during in comparison to due to higher interest rates on higher cash and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate due to the allowable extraterritorial income exclusion eti  the qualified production activities deduction and the federal research and development credit

short term investments in consist of municipal  us government agency and corporate notes and bonds acquired with maturities that exceed three months 
short term investments in also included auction rate securities and equity securities

working capital decreased by approximately million primarily due to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities of and financing activities of million were offset by million of expenditures related to our acquisition activity in and capital purchases 
revolving line of credit in may  we entered into a new senior credit facility the new credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility  which can be increased to million upon our request and approval of a simple majority of the lenders 
the new credit facility also contains a million letter of credit subfacility and a million swingline subfacility 
this new credit facility replaced our previous million revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility is secured by our non realty assets including cash  accounts and notes receivable  and inventories and has an expiration date of may  with a one time option to extend to april  if no default has occurred 
interest rates under the new credit facility are  at our option  based upon the current prime rate or the libor plus a margin that varies with our leverage ratio 
if interest is paid based upon the prime rate  the applicable margin is between minus and 
if interest is paid based upon the libor  the applicable margin is between and 
we are required to pay a commitment fee between and per annum on the unused portion of the new credit facility based on our leverage ratio 
the new credit facility contains limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness  limitations on the incurrence of liens and licensing of intellectual property  limitations on investments and restrictions on certain payments 
except to the extent paid for by common equity of greatbatch or paid for out of cash on hand  the new credit facility limits the amount paid for acquisitions to million 
the restrictions on payments  among other things  limits repurchases of greatbatch s stock to million and limits our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of our convertible subordinated notes 
these limitations can be waived upon the company s request and approval of a simple majority of the lenders 
such waiver was obtained in order to fund the precimed acquisition 
in addition  the new credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda  as defined in the agreement  to interest expense of at least to  and a total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  of not greater than to from may  through september  and not greater than to from september  and thereafter 
the new credit facility contains customary events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  a majority of the lenders may declare all obligations under the new credit facility immediately due and payable 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility as of december  in connection with our acquisitions that closed in early  we borrowed approximately million under the new credit facility 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  capital expenditure and debt service needs for the foreseeable future  other than for acquisitions 
operating activities in total  net cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million from this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in net income excluding non cash items ie depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  gains loss on investments  disposal of pp e  foreign currency contract and debt extinguishment  and ipr d charges 
the extinguishment of debt in resulted in a reclassification of approximately million of current income tax liability which was paid in this amount was previously recorded as a non current deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 
the remainder of the variance relates to the net change in working capital accounts due to the timing of the receipt payment of accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory levels 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  capital expenditure and debt service needs  other than for acquisitions 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily the result of our acquisitions in million which were funded with both short term investments and cash on hand 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased million over the majority of this increase relates to our new ecp manufacturing facility in raynham  ma and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in clarence  ny which will be completed in the remainder of the property  plant and equipment purchases relate to routine investments in order to support our internal growth and to maintain our technology leadership 
in addition to the above  in we made an additional million investment in intelect medical  inc  an early stage neurostimulation device company that works in conjunction with the cleveland clinic 
our current expectation for is that capital spending will be in the range of million to million  of which million relates to the construction of our new ecp manufacturing facility and the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
we regularly engage in discussions relating to potential acquisitions and may announce an acquisition transaction at any time 
we continually assess our financing facilities and capital structure to ensure liquidity and capital levels are sufficient to meet our strategic objectives 
going forward  we expect the pace of acquisitions to be less than the level 
however  we will continue to pursue strategically targeted and opportunistic acquisitions 
financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities for primarily related to net proceeds of million received in connection with the issuance of convertible subordinated notes due during the first quarter 
we paid approximately million of financing fees related to this transaction as well as the new credit facility discussed above 
in connection with the enpath acquisition  we acquired million of debt which we subsequently paid down with short term investments and cash on hand 
cash flows from financing activities also include cash received from stock option exercises 
capital structure at december   our capital structure consisted of million of convertible subordinated notes and our million shares of common stock outstanding 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
the market value of our outstanding common stock since our ipo has exceeded our book value  accordingly  we believe that if needed we can access public markets to sell additional common or preferred stock assuming conditions are appropriate 
our capital structure allows us to support our internal growth and provides liquidity for corporate development initiatives 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
litigation we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
while we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending activities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in the period in which the ruling occurs 
during  a former non medical customer commenced an action alleging that we had used proprietary information of the customer to develop certain products 
we have meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending the matter 
the potential risk of loss is between and million 
in connection with our acquisition of enpath  we assumed liability in connection with the following proceeding on june   enpath was named as defendant in a patent infringement action filed by pressure products medical supplies  inc and venued in the us district court in the eastern district of texas 
on october   enpath was officially served 
enpath has filed an answer denying liability and has filed counterclaims against the plaintiff alleging antitrust violations and patent misuse 
the plaintiff has alleged that enpath s flowguard tm valved introducer  which has been on the market for more than three years  infringes claims in the plaintiff s patents and is seeking damages and injunctive relief 
enpath believes that the plaintiff s claims are without merit and intends to pursue its defenses vigorously 
revenues from products sold that include the flowguard valved introducer were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the lawsuit is currently in the discovery stage 
the district court held a hearing to construe the claims of the plaintiff s patents in august  but has not yet issued its decision 
it is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of this litigation at this time  including whether it will affect our ability to sell our flowguard products  or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss

c 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we enter into blanket orders with vendors that have preferred pricing and terms  however these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
d 
in november  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire precimed which included its right to purchase the depuy chaumont  france manufacturing facility 
these transactions closed in in exchange for approximately million in cash  and a contingent payment  as defined in the precimed purchase agreement  which can range from chf to  chf depending on precimed s earnings performance 
the years amount was based upon the exchange ratio of chf per one us dollar as of december  and is subject to change due to foreign currency fluctuations and the final calculation of the contingent payment 
the purchase price was funded with cash on hand approximately million and availability under our revolving credit agreement approximately million and is an interest only obligation until the expiration of the revolving credit agreement in may inflation we utilize certain critical raw materials including precious metals in our products that we obtain from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials with our customers 
we cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials because of these requirements 
additionally  increasing global demand for some of the critical raw materials we need for our business has caused the prices of these materials to increase significantly 
our results may be negatively impacted from an increase in the prices of these critical raw materials 
this risk is partially mitigated as many of the supply agreements that we have with our customers allow us to partially adjust prices for the impact of any raw material price increases 
historically  raw material price increases have not materially impacted our results of operations

that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas no 
called the purchase method be used for all business combinations 
this statement also retains the guidance in sfas no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill

in february  the fasb issued fsp fas b effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of fas we believe that the provisions of sfas no 
applicable to us beginning in fiscal year will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are still evaluating what impact the provisions of sfas no 
that were deferred will have on our consolidated financial statements  which are effective beginning in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our revolving line of credit any borrowings bear interest at fluctuating market rates 
at december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our line of credit and thus no interest rate sensitive financial instruments other than short term investments 
we do not believe that the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our short term investments will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we borrowed in excess of million under our million revolving credit agreement to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions 
this borrowing bears interest at variable rates and thereby will subject us to interest rate risk in the future 
we incur certain expenses related to our mexican and china operations that are denominated in a foreign currency 
given the size of these operations in relation to the overall company  they did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we completed two acquisitions that had operations in europe 
correspondingly foreign currency fluctuations are anticipated to have a greater impact on our future results 
we are currently in the process of evaluating our foreign currency risk as a result of these transactions in order to develop a plan to best mitigate these risks  which could include the use of various derivative instruments 
in december  we entered into a forward contract to purchase  chf  at an exchange rate of chf per one us dollar  in order to partially fund the acquisition of precimed  which closed in january and was payable in swiss francs 
in january  we entered into an additional forward contract to purchase  chf at an exchange rate of per one us dollar 
we entered into a similar foreign exchange contract in january in order to fund the acquisition of depuy s chaumont france facility  which closed in february and was payable in euros
