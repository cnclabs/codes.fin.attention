item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis md a provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other readers to assess our financial condition and results of operations 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
this md a is organized in the following major sections overview  including summary of fiscal results  growlean initiative  and outlook for fiscal results of operations performance by business segment financial condition off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations critical accounting policies and estimates overview we design  manufacture  and market professional turf maintenance equipment and services  turf and agricultural micro irrigation systems  landscaping equipment  and residential yard and irrigation products worldwide 
we sell our products through a network of distributors  dealers  hardware retailers  home centers  mass retailers  and over the internet 
our businesses are organized into two reportable business segments professional and residential 
a third reportable segment called other consists of domestic company owned distribution companies and corporate activities  including corporate financing activities 
our emphasis is to provide well built  dependable  and innovative products supported by an extensive service network 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been  and we expect it to continue to be  attributable to new and enhanced products 
summary of fiscal results fiscal was a difficult year with a slight increase in net sales and a decline in net earnings 
our fiscal results included the following items of significance net sales for fiscal increased slightly by percent compared to fiscal due primarily to strong international sales  which were offset by lower domestic sales as a result of the continued weakening of the domestic economy 
international net sales continued to grow with a double digit increase of percent compared to fiscal approximately million of this increase was the result of the weaker us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
this increase was also attributable to our continued investments in new products and growth in the international golf market  mainly in asia and canada 
international net sales comprised percent of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal professional segment net sales  which represented over two thirds of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal  increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to the continued growth and demand in international markets  particularly the golf market  as well as our successful introduction of new products 
however  our professional segment net sales growth rate was hampered by the continued weakening of the domestic economy and the poor domestic housing market 
our residential segment net sales slightly rose by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to strong demand of snow thrower products in north america due to heavy snow falls during the winter season  which was partially offset by lower demand for walk power mowers as a result of the continued weakening of the domestic economy and poor spring weather 
fiscal net earnings decreased percent compared to fiscal  and diluted net earnings per share declined percent compared to fiscal our after tax return on sales for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal gross margin was percent in fiscal  down from percent in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced significant increases in commodity and fuel costs which hindered our gross margin as compared to fiscal we were not able to offset the higher costs paid for commodities and fuel  despite increasing prices on most of our products and continued use of lean methods to reduce costs 
in addition  our gross margin for fiscal was negatively impacted by higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production in an effort to lower inventory levels 
selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal remained unchanged at percent compared to fiscal we continued to generate strong cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
this allowed us to continue to reinvest in product development  brand building  and new technologies  repurchase shares of our stock  fund acquisitions  and increase our cash dividend in fiscal we increased our fiscal quarterly cash dividend for the fourth consecutive year 
we continued with our stock repurchase program in fiscal which reduced our number of shares outstanding 
this reduction resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings per share of approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the difficult domestic economic conditions we faced in fiscal  we improved our asset management with a percent decline in our inventory and our domestic field inventory levels were lower as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal growlean initiative in fiscal  we launched our growlean initiative 
this three year initiative focuses our efforts more intensely on revenue growth and asset management while maximizing our use of lean methods to reduce costs and improve quality and efficiency in our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices 
we believe we have opportunities to create a leaner  cohesive enterprise that has the potential to deliver long term positive financial performance 
building a growth enterprise 
we have identified several strategic focus areas to drive revenue growth in our businesses and accelerate opportunities to expand our global presence through stronger customer relations  acquisitions  alliances  and new partnerships 
our revenue growth growlean initiative goal is to grow net sales at an average annual rate of percent or more over the three year period ending october  for the first two years of our growlean initiative  our average annual net sales growth rate was percent 
based on our average annual net sales growth rate for fiscal and  as well as our anticipated net sales growth for fiscal  excluding the impact of any potential acquisitions  we do not expect to achieve the percent average annual revenue growth goal of our growlean initiative 
however  we are investing in new product development  marketing  distribution  and other strategies to help build market share and strengthen our brands worldwide 
at the same time  we are pursuing targeted acquisitions using a disciplined approach that will add value to our existing brands and product portfolio 
we also expect to invest in developing innovative  customer valued products to generate revenue growth 
building a lean enterprise 
our continuous improvement journey  which was part of our two previous three year initiatives  created awareness on our part of the root causes of waste and inefficiency throughout our entire organization 
we believe we now have a strong foundation on which to elevate our internal use of lean tools while expanding them externally to our suppliers and distribution partners 
the profitability goal within our growlean initiative is to achieve a consistent after tax return on sales of percent or more over the three year period ending october  for the first two years of our growlean initiative  our average after tax return on sales was percent 
however  given the current recessionary conditions and our anticipated after tax return on sales for fiscal  excluding the impact of any potential acquisitions  we do not expect to achieve the percent or more profitability goal of our growlean initiative 
however  we plan to continue to employ lean methods  such as value stream mapping  to identify and eliminate constraints and barriers within and across our businesses and functions 
in addition  we plan to continue to fine tune enterprise wide systems  such as design for manufacturing and assembly  to deliver products more competitively and efficiently 
improving asset management 
in our quest to become an integrated lean enterprise  we have placed additional emphasis on asset management 
this is an endeavor that we believe will fundamentally change the way we do business 
our long term asset management growlean initiative goal is to reduce average net working capital as a percent of net sales below percent  or in the teens 
we define net working capital as accounts receivable plus inventory less trade payables 
in fiscal and  our average net working capital as a percentage of net sales was percent and percent  respectively 
we have reduced and plan to continue reducing inventory in our distribution channels within our plants and warehouses  as well as at our distributors 
throughout the supply chain  we expect to reduce our costs as more of our products use the same components and we negotiate better supplier agreements 
in fiscal  we continued to roll out a pull based production system that we plan to implement in all of our plants over time 
the pull model is based on retail sales that trigger replenishment cycles throughout the supply chain 
as manufacturing is then better synchronized with customer demand  we expect significant inventory reductions at our production facilities 
we expect that our focus on asset management will improve customer satisfaction by delivering the right products to the right customer at just the right time to meet current demand 
outlook for fiscal fiscal was a difficult year as we faced a weakening domestic economy and a poor domestic housing market 
we are uncertain how deep  long  or widespread this current recession will be  and we also expect economic conditions in key international markets to weaken in fiscal compared to fiscal however  we have taken and continue to take proactive measures to manage through this tough economic environment 
we believe the key drivers for our fiscal financial performance will include  among many others  the following main factors international markets will continue to be a long term focus for us to grow our revenues 
we plan to continue investing in new products designed specifically for international markets and in infrastructure around the world that will connect us closer to international customers  increasing our global presence 
our goal is for international sales to continue to comprise a larger percentage of our total consolidated net sales 
however  as we experienced the weakening of the domestic economy during fiscal  we also anticipate international economic growth to slow down in fiscal  and coupled with the recent strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business  we expect a lower growth rate for our international business in fiscal compared to the growth rates we experienced in the past three fiscal years 
we anticipate net sales in our professional segment to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal as we anticipate the weakening of worldwide economies and tight credit markets to continue in fiscal however  we plan to increase our market share by enhancing our product offering with innovative new and improved products 
for example  in fiscal we plan to increase our product offering of landscape contractor equipment with a next generation line of zero turn radius riding mowers and grandstand premium stand on mowers 
in addition  we anticipate growth in the micro irrigation market as the need to become more efficient in water use is expected to drive demand for our micro irrigation systems 
fiscal was a challenging year for our residential segment as economic and poor spring weather conditions were unfavorable to our business 
these conditions continue to be a concern for us as we enter fiscal however  we are facing the challenge with a broad array of new product offerings and expanded product placement at a key retailer in fiscal during fiscal  we again experienced increased costs for commodities  and we anticipate average prices paid for commodities to be higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  namely steel  despite recent commodity cost declines 
in addition  we expect higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization in fiscal compared to fiscal due to anticipated lower sales volumes and continued efforts to reduce inventory levels 
these anticipated higher costs are expected to impede our gross margin growth rate in fiscal compared to fiscal we have implemented price increases on most products  and we continue to make progress using lean methods and principles as part of our growlean initiative to offset these anticipated higher costs 
we anticipate net earnings and diluted net earnings per share in fiscal to be down compared to fiscal  as we expect net sales and gross margins to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we expect our net sales and earnings will be hampered from foreign currency exchange rate translation as the us dollar has significantly strengthened compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our focus on improving asset utilization as part of our growlean initiative 
we anticipate reducing our net working capital as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal through prudent inventory management 
consistent with our focus on asset management  our current overall domestic field inventory levels are within our expectations 
we will continue to keep a cautionary eye on domestic and international economies  commodity prices  weather conditions  field inventory levels  retail demand  competitive actions  and other factors identified in part i  item a  risk factors of this report  which could cause our actual results to differ from our anticipated outlook 
results of operations fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  a decrease of percent from per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings decline were lower gross margins  a higher effective tax rate  and a decline in other income 
however  our net earnings per diluted share were benefited by approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of reduced shares outstanding from repurchases of our common stock 
fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
fiscal diluted net earnings per share were  an increase of percent over per share in fiscal the primary factors contributing to the net earnings increase were higher net sales and an increase in gross margins  somewhat offset by higher selling  general  and administrative expenses and an increase in our effective tax rate 
in addition  our share repurchase program resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings per share of approximately per share in fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of our consolidated net sales 
fiscal years ended october net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expense interest expense other income  net provision for income taxes net earnings fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  a slight increase of percent 
this net sales increase was primarily driven by strong international net sales that increased percent as a result of continued growth and demand for our products in international markets  particularly in the golf market  and the successful introduction of new products 
a weaker us dollar during most of fiscal compared to other currencies in which we transact business accounted for approximately million of our sales growth 
partially offsetting those positive factors were lower domestic shipments as a result of the continued weakening of the domestic economy and customers reluctance to place orders due to the uncertain economic environment  which has resulted in lower field inventory levels for our domestic businesses 
looking ahead  we expect our net sales to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal as we are uncertain how deep or long this current recession will be 
we also anticipate international economic growth to slow down in fiscal  and we expect a negative impact on net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the recent strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
gross margin 
gross margin represents gross profit net sales less cost of sales as a percentage of net sales 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled cost of sales  for a description of expenses included in cost of sales 
gross margin decreased by percentage points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this decline was mainly the result of the following factors increased commodity and fuel costs 
higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production in an effort to lower inventory levels 
increased tooling costs from accelerated depreciation of tooling no longer used and investments in tooling for new products 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were price increases introduced on most products 
a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
continued focus on cost reduction efforts and productivity improvements as part of our growlean initiative 
looking ahead  we expect gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal to decline due to anticipated higher average costs for commodities  higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization  and an unfavorable impact from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
however  price increases and benefits from our ongoing profit improvement initiatives  driven by our emphasis on lean manufacturing  should in part offset these anticipated higher costs 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense decreased million or percent from fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  in the section entitled selling  general  and administrative expense  for a description of expenses included in sg a expense 
sg a expense rate represents sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
sg a expense rate in fiscal remained unchanged at percent compared to fiscal the following factors increased our sg a expense increased spending for marketing 
higher level of investments in engineering 
costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments 
offsetting those increases were a decline in incentive compensation expense due to lower than planned financial performance in fiscal a decrease in product liability and self insurance costs attributable to favorable claims experience 
looking ahead  sg a expense is expected to decrease as we reduce spending in response to anticipated difficult economic conditions continuing in fiscal however  our sg a expense rate is expected to be higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due to fixed sg a costs spread over anticipated lower sales volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased slightly by percent compared to fiscal due to interest expense paid in fiscal on million of notes that were repaid in june and a decline in average interest rates  somewhat offset by higher average debt levels 
other income  net 
other income  net consists mainly of interest income  financing revenue  litigation settlements and recoveries  currency exchange rate gains and losses  and equity losses from investments 
other income  net for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was due mainly to the following factors foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange gains in fiscal lower interest income 
a decline in financing revenue 
somewhat offsetting those decreases was higher litigation settlement recovery in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due mainly to the tax impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  our fiscal tax rate was benefited by the increase in benefits related to the domestic research credit as a result of the retroactive extension of this credit by the tax relief and health care act of looking ahead  the tax rate for fiscal is expected to remain unchanged at percent 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
net sales growth was primarily driven by strong international net sales that grew percent as a result of strong demand in international markets  particularly in the golf market  and the successful introduction of new products 
a weaker us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business accounted for approximately million of our sales growth 
increased professional segment net sales due to the successful introduction of new products and growth in the sports fields and grounds market 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors was a decline in residential segment net sales primarily from lower shipments of snow thrower products due to the lack of snow fall in key markets during the winter season of  which was partially offset by an increase of riding and walk power mower product shipments as we introduced new innovative and enhanced products that were well received by consumers 
lower landscape contractor equipment product sales due mainly to efforts to reduce field inventory levels as part of our asset improvement initiative 
gross margin 
gross margin increased by percentage points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this increase was mainly the result of the following factors increased sales of higher margin products 
price increases introduced on some products 
cost reduction efforts  including benefits from past and continuing profit improvement initiatives 
a weaker us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
a charge for customs duties last fiscal year that negatively impacted gross margins in fiscal somewhat offsetting those positive factors were increased commodity costs 
higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we cut production in an effort to lower inventory levels 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense increased million or percent from fiscal sg a expense rate increased slightly to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the increase in sg a expense rate was due to the rate of increase of our overall sg a costs that outpaced our sales growth rate of percent  as well as the following other factors fiscal self insurance costs were up because we did not have the same reduction of insurance costs from favorable claims experience as in fiscal increased investments for engineering 
higher incentive compensation expense 
somewhat offsetting those increases were lower warranty expense due to a reduction of special warranty provisions for major product modifications in fiscal  compared to fiscal in which we incurred special warranty provisions for major product modifications and a product recall 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal due to higher average levels of debt and slightly higher average interest rates 
other income  net 
other income  net for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal this increase was due mainly to the following factors higher interest income 
lower losses on investments 
somewhat offsetting those increases were lower litigation settlement recoveries compared to those we received in fiscal a decline in financing revenue 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was due to the unfavorable timing of the phase out phase in provisions of the united states export exclusion compared to the domestic manufacturing deduction  somewhat offset by an increase in benefits related to the domestic research credit in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the retroactive extension of this credit by the tax relief and health care act of performance by business segment as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in two reportable business segments professional and residential 
a third reportable segment called other consists of company owned distribution companies and corporate activities  including corporate financing functions 
operating earnings for each of our two business segments is defined as earnings from operations plus other income  net 
operating loss for the other segment includes earnings loss from domestic wholly owned distribution company operations  corporate activities  including corporate financing activities  other income  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments net sales and operating results 
professional professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal and  and percent for fiscal the following table shows the professional segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales    change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following factors higher international net sales as a result of continued strong demand and growth in international markets  particularly in the golf market  as well as a weaker average us dollar compared to the other currencies in which we transact business 
the success of new products introduced within the past two years 
incremental sales from strategic acquisitions 
partially offsetting those positive factors were lower domestic product shipments as a result of decreased demand due to the weak domestic economy  as well as the poor domestic housing market that led to a decline in professionally installed irrigation systems 
the lower shipments also resulted in a decline of our domestic field inventory levels  which were down as of the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up percent compared to fiscal higher international shipments led this increase as a result of strong demand and growth in international markets  particularly in the golf market  as well as a weaker us dollar compared to the other currencies in which we transact business 
in addition  strong worldwide demand and growth in the sports fields and grounds markets resulted in higher equipment product sales  as well as the success of new products introduced within the past two years 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were lower shipments of landscape contractor equipment due mainly to efforts to reduce field inventory levels 
looking ahead  net sales for the professional segment are expected to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal as we anticipate the current recessionary domestic economy to continue through fiscal  and we also anticipate international economic growth to slow down in fiscal however  we expect new products to be well received and we plan to increase our market share in fiscal operating earnings 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins decreased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors negatively impacted professional segment operating earnings lower gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased commodity costs and fuel prices  as well as higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization  which were somewhat offset by price increases on most products  continued cost reduction efforts  and a weaker average us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
higher sg a expense rate in fiscal compared to due to continued investments in engineering and marketing  partially offset by a decline in product liability and warranty expense from favorable claims experience 
operating earnings for the professional segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the operating profit improvement was due mainly to higher gross margins as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  price increases on some products  cost reduction efforts  and a weaker us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
however  higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization somewhat tempered the increase in gross margins and operating earnings 
a higher sg a expense rate also hampered the increase in operating earnings due to increased investments in engineering and marketing  somewhat offset by a decline in warranty expense 
looking ahead  professional segment operating earnings are expected to be down in fiscal compared to fiscal due to anticipated lower sales volumes and a decline in gross margins from anticipated higher average costs for commodities  higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization  and an unfavorable impact from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
residential residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal and  and percent for fiscal the following table shows the residential segment net sales  operating earnings  and operating earnings as a percent of net sales 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating earnings as a percent of net sales net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were slightly up by percent compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following factors strong snow thrower product sales in north america due to heavy snow falls during the winter season of and low field inventory levels entering the upcoming winter season 
continued strong demand in international markets  mainly for riding products and pope products sold in australia 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were lower demand for walk power mowers as a result of the continued weakening of the domestic economy and poor spring weather  as well as a reduction in product placement and increased competitive pressure for walk power mowers 
a continued decline in electric trimmer product shipments due to additional lost placement at a key retailer 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were slightly down by percent compared to fiscal this decline was due primarily to a reduction in shipments of snow thrower products as a result of lower levels of snow fall during the winter season in key markets and lower electric trimmer sales due to lost placement at a key retailer 
those net sales decreases were somewhat offset by strong worldwide demand of riding products  as we introduced our redesigned toro timecutter z series of zero turning radius riding mowers in fiscal  and higher shipments of walk power mowers due to the successful introduction of new and enhanced models 
looking ahead  residential segment net sales are expected to decline fiscal compared to fiscal as we anticipate the current recessionary domestic economy to continue through fiscal however  we anticipate customer acceptance of new product introductions and expanded product placement at a key retailer to somewhat mitigate the expected sales decline 
operating earnings 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins declined to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the following factors negatively impacted residential segment operating earnings lower gross margins primarily from increased commodity costs and increased tooling expense 
higher sg a expense rate due mainly to increased spending for marketing 
operating earnings for the residential segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins rose to percent compared to percent in fiscal due to higher gross margins as a result of improved margins on new products and a weaker us dollar compared to most other currencies in which we transact business 
in addition  fiscal gross margins were hampered by a charge for customs duties 
a lower sg a expense rate also contributed to the operating earnings improvement due primarily to a decline in warranty expense and lower spending for marketing 
looking ahead  residential segment operating earnings in fiscal are expected to be down compared to fiscal due to anticipated lower sales volumes and a decline in gross margins from anticipated higher average costs for commodities  higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization  and an unfavorable impact from the strengthening of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact business 
other dollars in millions fiscal years ended october net sales change from prior year operating loss net sales 
net sales for the other segment includes sales from our wholly owned domestic distribution companies less sales from the professional and residential segments to those distribution companies 
in addition  elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from the toro credit company are also included in this segment 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal as a result of the continued weakening of the domestic economy and the sale of a portion of the operations of one of our company owned distributorships in the first quarter of fiscal effective november   our two company owned domestic distributorships were merged together 
the other segment net sales in fiscal decreased percent compared to fiscal due mainly to lower sales at a company owned distributor 
operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange rate losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency exchange rate gains in fiscal and costs incurred in fiscal for workforce adjustments  somewhat offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased by percent compared to fiscal this loss increase was primarily the result of higher self insurance costs in fiscal compared to fiscal because we did not have the same reduction of insurance costs from favorable claims experience  increased incentive compensation expense  lower financing revenue  and an increase in interest expense 
financial condition working capital we have taken proactive measures to help us manage through the tough economic environment that persisted throughout fiscal  including adjusting production plans  controlling costs  and managing our assets 
as such  our financial condition remains strong 
we are continuing to place additional emphasis on asset management with our growlean initiative  with a focus on i ensuring strong profitability of our products and services all the way through the supply chain  ii minimizing the amount of working capital in the supply chain  and iii maintaining or improving order replenishment and service levels to end users 
the following table highlights several key measures of our working capital performance 
dollars in millions fiscal years ended october average cash and cash equivalents average receivables  net average inventories  net average accounts payable average days outstanding for receivables average inventory turnover x x average receivables  net decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average days outstanding for receivables decreased to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal due in part to lower average field inventory levels as our customers focused on improving asset management  as well as shipping certain products direct to dealers 
average net inventories decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and average inventory turnover improved by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal as we curtailed production levels and continued our focus to improve asset management 
we expect average receivables  net in fiscal to slightly decrease compared to fiscal and we expect average inventories  net to also decline in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate both average days outstanding for receivables and average inventory turnover to improve in fiscal compared to fiscal as we plan to continue our efforts to improve asset utilization as part of our growlean initiative 
capital expenditures and other long term assets fiscal capital expenditures of million were percent higher compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to production equipment and tooling expenditures for new products 
capital expenditures for fiscal are planned to be approximately to million as we plan to continue to invest in tooling for new products and manufacturing equipment 
long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   a slight increase of percent 
this increase was due primarily to the addition of intangible assets from acquisitions 
capital structure the following table details the components of our total capitalization and key ratios 
dollars in millions october short term debt long term debt  including current portion stockholders equity debt to capitalization ratio our debt to capitalization ratio was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to a decrease in stockholders equity as we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock  as well as a slight increase in debt 
liquidity and capital resources our businesses are seasonally working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of raw materials used in production  replacement parts inventory  capital expenditures  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing receivables from customers 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  bank credit lines  and cash on hand  will provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating requirements 
we believe that the funds available through existing financing arrangements and forecasted cash flows will be sufficient to provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  debt repayments  quarterly cash dividend payments  and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
on april   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may  the senior notes were priced at of par value  and the resulting discount of million associated with the issuance of these senior notes is being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
the underwriting fee and direct debt issue costs totaling million is also being amortized over the life of the notes 
although the coupon rate of the senior notes is  the effective interest rate is after taking into account the issuance discount 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually  on may and november of each year 
the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contain customary covenants and event of default provisions 
we have the right to redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at the greater of the full principal amount of the senior notes being redeemed  or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis at the treasury rate plus basis points  plus  in both cases  accrued and unpaid interest 
in the event of the occurrence of both i a change of control of the company and ii a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating by both moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s ratings services within a specified period  we would be required to make an offer to purchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase 
we used the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay million outstanding principal amount of notes that were due on june   as well as for general corporate purposes 
cash dividends each quarter in fiscal  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share which was a percent increase over our cash dividend of per share paid each quarter in fiscal cash flow cash flows provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities during the past three fiscal years are shown in the following table 
dollars in millions cash provided by used in fiscal years ended october operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net cash provided cash and cash equivalents as of fiscal year end cash flows provided by operating activities 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased percent from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a decline in inventory levels and a larger reduction in accounts receivables in fiscal compared to fiscal  somewhat offset by a decrease in net earnings 
cash flows used in investing activities 
capital expenditures and acquisitions are our primary uses of capital resources 
these investments have enabled sales growth in diverse and new markets  helped us to meet product demand  and increased our manufacturing efficiencies 
cash used in investing activities increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due mainly to an increase in purchases of property  plant  and equipment  somewhat offset by higher amounts of cash utilized last year for acquisitions 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower levels of cash used for repurchases of our common stock in fiscal compared to fiscal somewhat offsetting this decrease was additional net proceeds we received in fiscal from the issuance of senior notes in the principal amount of million in april previously discussed  less the payment of long term notes in the principal amount of million in june in addition  we received less proceeds from stock options exercised and tax benefits from stock based awards in fiscal compared to fiscal credit lines and other capital resources our business is seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april  as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
the seasonality of production and shipments causes our working capital requirements to fluctuate during the year 
our peak borrowing usually occurs between january and april 
seasonal cash requirements are financed from operations and with short term financing arrangements  including a million unsecured senior five year revolving credit facility that expires in january interest expense on this credit line is determined based on a libor rate plus a basis point spread defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our non us operations maintain unsecured short term lines of credit of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
we also have a letter of credit subfacility as part of our credit agreement 
average short term debt was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or percent 
in fiscal  we received additional net proceeds from the issuance of million senior notes in april that we used to pay down short term debt  which was the primary contributor to the increase in average short term debt in fiscal compared to fiscal as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under our credit agreements 
significant financial covenants in our credit agreement include interest coverage and debt to capitalization ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our credit agreement as of october   and we expect to be in compliance with all covenants during fiscal our credit agreement requires compliance with all of the covenants defined in the agreement 
if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by our credit agreement following the applicable cure period  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term public notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our short term debt under our credit agreement 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade and or our average debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ratio falls below a certain level  the interest rate we currently pay on our outstanding short term debt under the credit agreement would increase 
however  the credit commitment could not be cancelled by the banks based solely on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt was unchanged during fiscal by standard and poor s ratings group at bbb and by moody s investors service at baa share repurchase plan during fiscal  we continued repurchasing shares of our common stock as a means of using excess cash and reducing our shares outstanding 
in addition  our repurchase programs provided shares for use in connection with our equity compensation programs 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
this repurchase authorization has no expiration date but may be terminated by our board of directors at any time 
as of october    shares remained available for repurchase under our board authorization 
the following table provides information with respect to repurchases of our common stock during the past three fiscal years 
dollars in millions  except per share data fiscal years ended october shares of common stock purchased   cost to repurchase common stock average price paid per share off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not customarily enter into off balance sheet arrangements  except for off balance sheet arrangements related to our customer financing activities  inventory purchase commitments  deferred compensation arrangements  and operating lease commitments disclosed in the contractual obligations table below 
moreover  it is not our normal policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
wholesale financing 
toro credit company tcc  a wholly owned financing subsidiary  provides financing for our north american toro distributors and approximately of our domestic dealers for select products that we manufacture 
independent north american toro and exmark distributors and dealers that do not finance through tcc generally finance their inventories with third party financing companies or pay cash 
all outstanding receivables of tcc are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
tcc and third party financing companies purchase selected receivables from us and our distributors and dealers for extended periods that assist our distributors and dealers in carrying representative inventories of products 
down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor and or the dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
we retain a security interest in the distributors and dealers inventories  and those inventories are monitored regularly 
under the sales terms to distributors and dealers  finance charges are applied to outstanding balances from the earlier of the date when product is sold to a customer  or the expiration of company supported finance terms granted at the time of sale  until payment is received by tcc or the third party finance company 
rates are generally fixed or based on the prime rate plus a fixed percentage depending on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
distributors and dealers cannot cancel purchases after goods are shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to customers 
third party financing companies purchased million of receivables from us during fiscal  of which million was outstanding as of october  our maximum exposure for credit recourse with a third party financing company related to receivables under these financing arrangements was million as of october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies for receivables sold by us to third party financing companies 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies over the past three fiscal years 
however  a decline in retail sales or financial difficulties of our distributors or dealers could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
end user financing 
we have agreements with a third party financing company to provide lease financing options to golf course and sports fields and grounds equipment customers in the united states and europe 
the purpose of these agreements is to increase sales by giving buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
during fiscal  we entered into an amended agreement that eliminated our contingent liability for any residual value risk on the underlying equipment financed under this program 
in addition  under the terms of the amended agreement  we are only contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection risk for leases entered into prior to the effective date of the amended agreement 
our maximum exposure for credit collection as of october  was million 
we also have an agreement to sell certain accounts receivable and notes to a third party 
the total amount of receivables and notes outstanding under this agreement may not exceed million at any time 
during fiscal  the company sold million of receivables and notes under the terms of this agreement 
termination or any material change to the terms of our end user financing arrangements  availability of credit for our customers  including any delay in securing replacement credit sources  or significant financed product repurchase requirements could have a material impact on our future operating results 
distributor financing 
from time to time  we enter into long term loan agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or facilitation of ownership changes 
as of october  and  we had outstanding notes receivable of million from two distribution companies 
the amounts are included in other current and long term assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
purchase commitments 
we have purchase commitments with some suppliers for materials and supplies as part of the normal course of business 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligation less than year years years more than years total long term debt short term debt interest payments deferred compensation arrangements purchase obligations operating leases total principal payments the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements  covering certain current and retired management employees  consists primarily of salary and bonus deferrals under our deferred compensation plans 
our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant elections 
deferred compensation balances earn interest based on rates of return on funds established by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors  and are payable at the election of the participants 
operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance 
as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we may be obligated for additional cash outflows of million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the payment and timing of any such payments is affected by the ultimate resolution of the tax years that are under audit or remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
market risk due to the nature and scope of our operations  we are subject to exposures that arise from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
additional information is presented in part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation and changing prices 
we experienced significantly higher costs for most commodities during fiscal  which negatively impacted our gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal we will continue to closely follow the commodities that affect our product lines  and we anticipate average prices paid for commodities in fiscal to be higher in fiscal  namely steel 
we plan to attempt to mitigate the impact of these anticipated increases in commodity costs and other inflationary pressures by increasing prices on most of our products  engaging in proactive vendor negotiations  internal cost reduction efforts  and reviewing alternative sourcing options 
acquisitions and divestiture in fiscal  we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of southern green  inc  a leading manufacturer of deep tine aeration equipment 
the acquisition of southern green s versatile line of soil reliever aerators helps grow our offering of highly productive turf cultivation equipment and provides entry into a new product category for our golf course and sports field markets 
in fiscal  we also completed the purchase of turf guard wireless monitoring technology from jlh labs  llc  a leader in wireless soil monitoring technology 
the turf guard system is designed to measure soil moisture  salinity  and temperature through buried wireless sensors that communicate data to an internet server for processing and presentation to a user through the web 
in fiscal  we also completed the sale of a portion of the operations of one of our company owned distributorships 
in fiscal  we completed the acquisition of rain master irrigation systems  inc rain master 
rain master manufactures irrigation central controllers and other products for the commercial landscape market 
in fiscal  we also completed the purchase of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of allen hover mower 
allen hover mower sells walk power mowers worldwide for the golf course and grounds maintenance markets that are specifically designed to perform well on steep inclines 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following warranty reserve 
warranty coverage on our products ranges from a period of six months to seven years  and generally covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs 
warranty coverage generally does not cover operator abuse or improper use 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty reserve by product line for estimated costs in connection with future warranty claims 
we also establish reserves for major rework campaigns 
the amount of our warranty reserves is based primarily on the estimated number of products under warranty  historical average costs incurred to service warranty claims  the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  and the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty reserves based on changes in these factors and record any necessary adjustments if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation due to such factors as performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers  product failure rates  and higher or lower than expected service costs for a repair 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims  our actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
an unexpected increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in our warranty accrual and a decrease in our net earnings 
sales promotions and incentives 
at the time of sale to a customer  we record an estimate for sales promotion and incentive costs which are classified as a reduction from gross sales or as a component of sg a expense 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include rebate programs on certain professional products sold to distributors  volume discounts  retail financing support  floor planning  cooperative advertising  commissions  and other sales discounts and promotional programs 
the estimates for sales promotion and incentive costs are based on the terms of the arrangements with customers  historical payment experience  field inventory levels  volume purchases  and expectations for changes in relevant trends in the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates if competitive factors dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive accruals or if customer usage and field inventory levels vary from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentive accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of the cost of inventory or net realizable value  with cost determined by either the last in  first out lifo method for most us inventories or the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
we establish reserves for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life  and forecasted sales demand 
valuation of inventory can also be affected by significant redesign of existing products or replacement of an existing product by an entirely new generation product 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  competitive factors  and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our manufacturing production accordingly 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded based on historical loss trends  ongoing cycle count and periodic testing adjustments  and inventory levels 
though management considers reserve balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which we operate could have an effect on the reserve balances required 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we value accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
each fiscal quarter  we prepare an analysis of our ability to collect outstanding receivables that provides a basis for an allowance estimate for doubtful accounts 
in doing so  we evaluate the age of our receivables  past collection history  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions 
based on this evaluation  we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
portions of our accounts receivable are protected by a security interest in products held by customers  which minimizes our collection exposure 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  or a significant slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable 
we believe that an analysis of historical trends and our current knowledge of potential collection problems provide us with sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger uncollectible accounts reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to sg a expense in the period that we made such a determination

no other new accounting pronouncement that has been issued but not yet effective for us during fiscal has had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we are also exposed to equity market risk pertaining to the trading price of our common stock 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
see further discussions on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the primary use of forward currency contracts 
we use derivative instruments only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes and not for trading purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries as well as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states and mexico  a stronger us dollar and mexican peso generally has a negative impact on our results from operations  while a weaker dollar and peso generally has a positive effect 
our primary currency exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the mexican peso  and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
worldwide foreign currency exchange rate exposures are reviewed monthly 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
during fiscal   and  the amount of losses treated as a reduction of net sales for contracts to hedge sales were million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains treated as a reduction to cost of sales for contracts to hedge inventory purchases were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal and all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet the hedging criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other income  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other income  net as of and for the fiscal year ended october  were as follows dollars in thousands except average contracted rate average contracted rate notional amount value in aocl income loss fair value impact loss gain buy us sell canadian dollar buy us sell australian dollar buy us sell euro buy us sell british pound buy mexican peso sell us our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  and would not impact net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to libor based short term debt from commercial banks  as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
we generally do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of october   our financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of million of short term debt outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant  including the average balance of short term debt outstanding during fiscal  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt that is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as a result  we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on our long term debt obligations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying amount of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into three treasury lock agreements based on a year us treasury security with a principal balance of million for two of the agreements and million for the third agreement 
these treasury lock agreements provided for a single payment at maturity  which was april   based on the change in value of the reference treasury security 
these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and resulted in a net settlement of million 
this loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and will be amortized to interest expense over the year term of the senior notes 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  aluminum  fuel  petroleum based resin  and linerboard 
in addition  we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  copper  lead  rubber  and others which are integrated into our end products 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
further information regarding rising prices for commodities is presented in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this report in the section entitled inflation 
we enter into fixed price contracts for future purchases of natural gas in the normal course of operations as a means to manage natural gas price risks 
these contracts meet the definition of normal purchases or normal sales and therefore  are not considered derivative instruments for accounting purposes 
our manufacturing facilities enter into these fixed price contracts for approximately to percent of their monthly anticipated usage 
equity price risk 
the trading price volatility of toro common stock impacts compensation expense related to our stock based compensation plans 
further information is presented in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements regarding our stock based compensation plans
