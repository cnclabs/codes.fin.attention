critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the assumptions  judgements and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting 
table of contents engagements  product sales in our technology development practice  fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which in those situations would generally be upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million

sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on december   the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for fiscal  we expect to adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed fsp fas b 
we are currently evaluating fas  but do not expect the partial adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows entities to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected must be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option can be applied instrument by instrument  however the election is irrevocable

revised sfas r  business combinations and sfas no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 

sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas r and sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we intend to adopt sfas r and sfas in fiscal liquidity and capital resources fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we financed our business in fiscal principally through available cash and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at the end of the prior year 

table of contents the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in net income  a larger increase in accrued payroll and employee benefits  a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and an increase in stock based compensation partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable 
the larger increase in accrued payroll and employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in accrued bonuses driven by a corresponding increase in profitability 
the larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
the increase in stock based compensation was due to additional restricted stock unit grants during fiscal and an increase in the accrued bonus that we expect to settle with fully vested restricted stock units 
the larger increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in revenues 
days sales outstanding decreased to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a smaller increase in accounts receivable and an increase in stock based compensation partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes

during fiscal  and  net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase and sale or maturity of short term investments 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs or strategically acquire professional services firms that are complementary to our business 
the following schedule summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  in thousands fiscal year operating lease commitments capital leases purchase obligations total thereafter the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain

we have a revolving reducing mortgage note with a total available borrowing amount of million and an outstanding balance of as of february  any amounts borrowed under the revolving reducing mortgage note are due and payable on january  we believe that our funds generated from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve month period 

table of contents in addition  we believe that the our funds generated from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated long term cash needs beyond the next twelve month period  however  we intend to grow our business by pursuing potential acquisitions  which could increase the need for additional sources of funds over the long term 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities auction rate maturity set at date of next auction in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
the average effective maturity of our investment portfolio of short term investments and cash equivalents at december  was years 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to liquidity and credit risk associated with our municipal auction rate securities 
in the event of a failed auction we would not have access to these funds until a future auction is successful 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
included within our investment portfolio at february  is one aaa rated municipal auction rate security valued at million 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash we do not expect any lack of liquidity related to this investment to negatively impact our ability to operate our business as usual 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
