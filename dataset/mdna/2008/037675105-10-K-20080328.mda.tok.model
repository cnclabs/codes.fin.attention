item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in to serve as the holding company for gilmer county bank now appalachian community bank 
since april  we also serve as the holding company for appalachian community bank  fsb since  we have experienced consistent growth in total assets  total loans  total deposits and shareholders equity 
the following table sets forth selected measures of our financial performance for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in thousands net income total assets total loans total deposits shareholders equity loans are net of unearned income like most community banks and thrifts  we derive the majority of our income from interest and fees received on our loans 
our primary sources of funds for making these loans and investments are our deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and advances from the fhlb 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances  income and expense and rates tables show for the periods indicated the average balance for each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of these tables show that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the analysis of changes in net interest income table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the periods shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included an interest sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income  as well as of our noninterest expense  included in the noninterest income and expense section 

table of contents the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as well as the general practices within the banking and thrift industry 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates 
these differences could have a material impact on our carrying values of assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the determination of the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  cash flow assumptions  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  the impact of current events and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management s estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the section entitled allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
results of operations income statement review overview for the year ended december   our net income was million  or basic net income per common share  as compared to million  or basic net income per common share  for the year ended december   and compared to million  or basic net income per common share  for the year ended december  our earnings during reflect the continued strong growth in loans and deposits primarily due to our de novo branch expansion initiative 
however  because we were negatively impacted by declining interest rates  our net interest margin decreased basis points from to  to 
operating expenses grew during to million  or  from this growth in operating expenses relates primarily to our de novo branch expansion and from hiring additional employees to staff our new banking offices and to support our continued growth 
in  we opened one new loan production office and converted it to a full service branch 
then  in  we converted two existing loan production offices into full service branches 
in addition  we opened two additional branches 
this activity added full time equivalent new employees during net interest income years ended december    and our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between the income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for net interest income increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for generally  the overall increase in net 
table of contents interest income was primarily the result of the growth in our loan portfolio 
our average total loans increased from to  and from to the continued growth of our loan portfolio is primarily due to growth in our new expansion markets as well as our existing markets 
these new markets are the primary reasons for the increase in interest income 
however  the increase in interest expense is largely the result of the significant growth of deposits and alternative funding sources  such as the fhlb and brokered deposits  required to fund our asset growth 
due to the continued fierce competition for local deposits  the growth in less costly alternative funding sources allowed us to more effectively manage the net interest margin 
the trend in net interest income is also evaluated in terms of average rates using the net interest margin and the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin  or the net yield on earning assets  is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources 
the net interest margin for was compared to a net interest margin of in and in net interest spread  the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing sources of funds  was in  compared to in  and in in the last quarter of  we experienced two decreases in the prime rate 
our certificate of deposit rates for similar maturities did not follow these decreases  yet our prime based loan portfolio rates decreased immediately 
however  our loan portfolio is comprised of fixed rate loans 
additionally  the average maturity of our certificate of deposit portfolio at the end of was slightly over months 
we believe that these factors will be beneficial as we adjust to a lower interest rate environment and continue to manage our margin 
although we continue to confront this margin compression with lower cost alternative funding sources  we cannot totally avoid it if we are to continue to maintain and grow our market share 
in  alternative funding sources had an overall weighted average cost of compared to competitors certificates of deposit  money market and interest checking account rates which ranged from up to 
we believe that  as our current temporary branch locations are converted to permanent banking facilities in our expansion markets  we will continue to grow core deposits and this will allow us to replace alternative funding sources with these core deposits 
until then  we will continue to use alternative funding sources as secondary sources to fund loan growth when necessary 
we also believe that the federal reserve s recent rate drops will dictate much lower competitive deposit rates because this interest margin squeeze is a banking industry concern and not unique to our company 
the continued strong demand for loans also provides us with the opportunity to develop business as the communities we serve continue to grow 
our expansionary activities during the second half of and in have generated significant growth in loans and deposits 
four of the new branch offices became profitable during the last half of  and two of those have been profitable since march we believe that our investment in these locations will enable us to take advantage of the growth in these markets and office profitability will continue to improve

table of contents analysis of changes in net interest income 
the following table sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in interest rates and in changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  segregated by category 
the change due to volume is calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior year s rate 
the change due to rate is calculated by multiplying the change in the applicable rate by the prior year s volume 
figures are presented on a taxable equivalent basis 
the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

the provision for loan losses was million for  million for  and million for please see the discussion below under allowance for loan losses for a description of the factors we consider in determining the amount of the provision we expense each period to maintain this allowance 
noninterest income years ended december   and noninterest income for  and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
these amounts are primarily from customer service fees  mortgage origination commissions  insurance commissions  as well as other fees charged to customers such as safe deposit box rental and atm fees 
customer service fees increased from million in  to million in  and grew to in the increase in customer service fees for all years is primarily related to our deposit account growth though our expansion initiative as well as our continuing efforts to increase the amount of deposit account charges based on our surveys of competitors 
as a result  non sufficient funds nsf and returned check charges increased during mortgage origination commissions increased from  in to million in and to million in the 
table of contents increase in mortgage origination commissions for all years relates primarily to the additional mortgage activity generated from our expansion initiative  which was responsible for of the increase in compared to in addition  we had continued loan demand in our market area 
noninterest expenses years ended december   and noninterest expenses totaled million in  up from million in  and million in as a percentage of total assets  our total noninterest expenses increased from in to in  and increased to in salaries and employee benefits increased million or  to million in  and increased million or  to million in from this increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to the additional staff necessary to support our continued existing market growth and our expansion initiative  as well as the addition of several management level employees necessary to provide the infrastructure to support our continued growth 
since december   we have added full time equivalent employees 
during  full time equivalent employees were hired  of which was the first full year that experienced this staffing increase 
in addition  certain of the agreements under our salary continuation plan were amended in may and august of  which caused an increase in noninterest expenses of approximately  from to  and an increase of approximately  from to occupancy  furniture and equipment expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase from to is primarily due to our expansion initiative which increased the number of branches and loan production offices from locations to other operating expenses increased from million in  to million in  and to million in these annual increases are primarily the result of increased marketing expenses  losses on sales of other real estate  amortization  director fees  data processing  legal fees  business license fees  and supplies and postage 
total marketing expenses increased  or from to  and increased  or from to the additional marketing expenses are due to the increased advertising and promotional activities necessitated by our growth in existing markets as well as our expansion initiative 
we had additional losses on sales of other real estate during of  as compared to amortization expense increased by  primarily due to an additional non compete agreement entered into in with a former employee 
the non compete agreement has a contract period of six months 
we expensed  of this agreement in our director and committee fees and other director compensation expenses increased by  to  compared to  in and  in this increase was due in part to the addition of community directors for our new markets  and to expenses in that are attributable to stock option grants to our directors 
data processing fees increased by  to  compared to  in and  in data processing increases were due to the addition of the thrift  as well as the other expansions 
legal fees increased by approximately  to  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in legal expense for is primarily due the organization and opening of appalachian community bank  fsb  our new federal thrift subsidiary  assistance to our compensation committee due to new compensation disclosure requirements for our proxy statement  as well as general corporate matters associated with our growing company 
also  we had increases in business license fees  atm costs  fdic and state exam assessments  as well as supplies and postage expenses which were all necessary to support our new thrift charter  expanded market growth and new branches

table of contents allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses charged as an expense on our income statement 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimated probable losses  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
in assessing adequacy  management relies predominantly on its ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which is undertaken both to determine whether there are probable losses that must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of the aggregate portfolio 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers and senior management  and also those of bank regulatory agencies that review the loan portfolio as part of the regular bank examination process 
in evaluating the allowance  management also considers our loan loss experience  the amount of past due and nonperforming loans  current and anticipated economic conditions  lender requirements and other appropriate information 
certain nonperforming loans are individually assessed for impairment under statement of accounting financial accounting standards sfas no 
and assigned specific allocations 
other identified high risk loans or credit relationships based on internal risk ratings are also individually assessed and assigned specific allocations 
periodically  we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances  including changes in general economic conditions  changes in the interest rate environment  changes in loan concentrations in various areas of our banking activities  changes in identified troubled credits  and economic changes in our market area 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allocation of the allowance to the respective loan segments is an approximation and not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in the overall loan portfolio 
in addition  the allowance is subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust the allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total outstanding loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total outstanding loans  at december   and million  or of outstanding loans  at december  our allowance for loan losses at december   included a specific allocation for an identified loan relationship  in the amount of  in the first quarter of we charged off approximately  of this specific reserve

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and foreclosed assets 
nonperforming loans include loans classified as nonaccrual or restructured loans and loans past due days or more 
our general practice is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when it is contractually past due days or more as to payment of principal or interest  unless the collateral value is significantly greater than both the principal due and the accrued interest and collection of principal and interest is probable 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
recognition of any interest after a loan has been placed on nonaccrual status is accounted for on a cash basis 
nonperforming loans were of total loans at december  and of total loans at december   compared to of total loans at december  for each of the five years in the period ended december   the difference between gross interest income that would have been recorded in such period  if the non accruing loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  and the amount of interest income on those loans  that was included in such period s net income  was immaterial 

table of contents the following table shows our nonperforming assets as well as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming assets  the total nonperforming loans to total loans  and the total nonperforming assets to total assets  for the years ended december  to at december  in thousands  except ratios non accruing loans loans past due days or more restructured loans total nonperforming loans non accruing securities other real estate other repossessed property total nonperforming assets ratios allowance to total nonperforming assets total nonperforming loans to total loans net of unearned interest total nonperforming assets to total assets the million in non accruing loans consist of loans broken down as follows loans totaling million in real estate construction loans  two loans totaling  million in real estate mortgage loans  one loan totaling  in the commercial financial agricultural industry and four loans totaling  in consumer loans 
loans past due days or more and still accruing consists of  in real estate construction loans   in real estate mortgage loans   in commercial financial agricultural loans and  in consumer loans 
we have in reserve for the nonaccrual loans approximately million at december  the majority of the nonperforming assets are secured by real estate with adequate loan to value ratios  therefore we do not expect significant losses related to these assets 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities deposits are the primary source of funds to support our earning assets 
average deposits increased  from million in to million in average deposits increased  from million in to million in at december   total deposits were million  of which million or  was interest bearing 
at december   total deposits were million  of which million or  was interest bearing 
alternative funding sources such as fhlb advances  national cds and brokered deposits were used to supplement funding sources 
these alternative funding sources increased million or in national cds and brokered deposits were million at december  at december   national cds and brokered deposits were million 
the increase in our national cds and brokered deposits was necessary to fund our growth in loans during the year ended december  at reasonable spreads 
alternative funding sources are a secondary source of funds utilized to fund loan growth 
the cost of these alternative funding sources can be less expensive than our local deposits as was the case in

in  we began using the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars in order to obtain fdic insurance on some of our larger customers 
although cdars are required to be categorized as brokered deposits  these deposits represent deposits greater than  originated in our local markets that are placed with other institutions that are members in the cdars network 
by placing these deposits in these other institutions  the deposits of our customers are fully insured by the fdic 
in return for the deposits that we place with network institutions  we receive from network institutions  deposits that are approximately equal in amount of what was originated from our customers 
in addition  the cdars are priced at local rates  which generally have lower rates than rates being offered for brokered deposits 
at december   cdars represented million of our deposits  or and at december   cdars represented million of our deposits  or 
we continue to focus on increasing our core deposit base 
the two categories of lowest cost deposits comprised the following percentages of average total deposits during average noninterest bearing demand deposits   and average savings deposits  
of average time deposits  approximately were large denomination certificates of deposit 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million  or  from year end to million at december   and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  during the same period to million 
the increase in noninterest bearing deposits has been the result of our focus on providing excellent customer service to our small business customers  our expansion into new markets  as well as by the development of relationships with new businesses that have moved into our communities 
as we continue migration from temporary branch locations to permanent facilities  we should continue to attract noninterest bearing deposits 

table of contents the following table sets forth the maturities of our time deposits of  or more by category at december  in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total borrowings short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounted to million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the weighted average rates were   and for  and  respectively

in addition  the effects of the stock based compensation expense as well as the exercise of  options during increased equity by million  including the tax benefit 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act establishes risk based capital guidelines that take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
our tier capital  which consists of common equity  paid in capital  retained earnings and qualifying trust preferred securities less intangible assets and treasury stock  amounted to million at december  tier capital components include supplemental capital components such as qualifying allowance for loan losses and trust preferred securities not qualified for tier capital

interest rate sensitivity management interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our portfolios of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates  either at replacement or maturity during the life of the instruments 
sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities in our current portfolio that is subject to repricing in future time periods 
the differences are known as interest rate sensitivity gaps and are usually calculated separately for segments of time  ranging from zero to days  to days  days to one year  one to five years  over five years and on a cumulative basis 
the following table indicates that  in a rising interest rate environment  our earnings may be adversely affected in the day periods where liabilities will reprice faster than assets  if rates move simultaneously 
for 
table of contents purposes of this table  all demand and savings deposits are included in the day period  but because these deposits are not as sensitive to rate change  we do not anticipate these deposits to mature in this time period 
we anticipate that these deposits will mature over all time periods 
as seen in the following table  for the first days of repricing opportunity  there is an excess of earning liabilities over interest bearing assets of approximately million 
for the first days  interest bearing liabilities exceed earning assets by approximately million 
during this one year time frame  of all interest bearing liabilities will reprice compared to of all interest earning assets 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remain the same  thus impacting net interest income 
it should be noted  therefore  that a matched interest sensitive position by itself would not ensure maximum net interest income 
the following table sets forth information regarding our rate sensitivity as of december  for each of the intervals indicated 
days days days years over years total in thousands  except ratios interest earning assets loans securities interest bearing deposits in other banks federal funds sold interest bearing liabilities demand deposits savings deposits time deposits other short term borrowings long term debt subordinated long term capital notes interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities cumulative ratio ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans 
excludes unrealized gains losses on securities 
securities are at book value 
excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing 
demand and savings deposits typically reprice simultaneously with market changes 

table of contents management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest rate sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates 
we also use simulation analysis to monitor and manage our interest rate sensitivity 
simulation analysis is the primary method of estimating earnings at risk and capital at risk under varying interest rate conditions 
simulation analysis is used to test the sensitivity of our net interest income and shareholders equity to both the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
simulation analysis accounts for the expected timing and magnitude of assets and liability cash flows  as well as the expected timing and magnitude of deposits that do not reprice on a contractual basis 
in addition  simulation analysis includes adjustments for the lag between movements in market interest rates on loans and interest bearing deposits 
these adjustments are made to reflect more accurately possible future cash flows  repricing behavior and ultimately net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income before provision for loan loss sensitivity over a one year time horizon is shown below 
such analysis assumes a sustained parallel shift in interest rates and our estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts will reprice in each scenario 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management s strategies  among other factors 
percentage increase decrease in interest income expense given interest rate shifts down basis points up basis points for the twelve months after december  projected change in interest income interest expense net interest income market risk market risk is the risk arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to a change in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk and achieve reasonable stability in net interest income throughout interest rate cycles 
this is achieved by maintaining the proper balance of rate sensitive earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
the relationship of rate sensitive earning assets to rate sensitive liabilities is the principal factor in projecting the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on future net interest income 
rate sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
management monitors the rate sensitivity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over the entire life of these instruments  but places particular emphasis on the first year and through three years 
we have not experienced a high level of volatility in net interest income primarily because of our asset liability management 
management continues to monitor the proper matching of asset liability repricing to keep our volatility at a low level 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we offer a variety of financial products to our customers to aid them in meeting their requirements for liquidity  credit enhancement and interest rate protection 
generally accepted accounting principles recognize these transactions as contingent liabilities and  accordingly  they are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit  credit card arrangements  commercial letters of 
table of contents credit and standby letters of credit all include exposure to some credit loss in the event of nonperformance of the customer 
we use the same credit policies and underwriting procedures for making off balance sheet credit commitments and financial guarantees as it does for on balance sheet extensions of credit 
because these instruments have fixed maturity dates  and because many of them expire without being drawn upon  they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to us 
management conducts regular reviews of these instruments on an individual customer basis  and the results are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments 
the following is a discussion of these commitments standby letters of credit 
these agreements are used by our customers as a means of improving their credit standings in their dealings with others 
under these agreements  we agree to honor certain financial commitments in the event that its customers are unable to do so 
the amount of credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit in the event of nonperformance by the other party is the contract amount 
as of december  and  we had issued standby letters of credit of approximately million and million  respectively 
when significant  we record a liability for the estimated fair value of standby letters of credit based on the fees charged 
loan commitments 
as of december  and  the bank had commitments outstanding to extend credit totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations that we must fund as part of our normal operations 
the following table shows aggregate information about our contractual obligations  and the periods in which payments are due 
the amounts and time periods are measured from december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations time deposits total impact of inflation the effect of relative purchasing power over time due to inflation has not been taken into account in our consolidated financial statements 
rather  our financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
unlike most industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  the effect of changes in interest rates will have a more significant impact on our performance than will the effect of changing prices and inflation in general 
in addition  interest rates may generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  although not necessarily in the same magnitude 
as discussed previously  we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin provides a two step process in the evaluation of a tax position 
the first step is recognition 
a company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including a resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based upon the technical merits of the position 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement
