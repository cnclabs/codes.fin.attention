the revaluation had no impact on the company s tangible net book value  liquidity or debt covenant measurements 
a gain on the sale of the company s waters medical systems  inc  wms subsidiary of million  net of tax losses associated with the discontinuance of the company s professional series automatic gate opener ps ago product line the reduction of nearly million of bank debt  and increased working capital primarily as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the wms subsidiary overview zareba systems  inc designs  manufactures and markets electronic perimeter fence and access control systems  operating in one world wide business segment 
zareba has three subsidiaries  zareba systems europe limited  zareba security  inc and zareba systems of canada ltd 
originally a medical products company serving small niche markets  the company expanded primarily through business acquisitions and evolved into the leading supplier of electric fencing systems in north america and the uk 
the acquisition of north central plastic  incorporated ncp in fiscal enabled the company to expand its electric fencing systems distribution and product offerings in north america 
the acquisition of rutland electric fencing company  ltd 
expanded the company s presence into europe and established the company in the security products market 
the company has also launched organic growth initiatives to leverage both its distribution channels and electric fencing systems technology 
in the first quarter of calendar year  the company introduced two new product lines within the zareba systems division  perimeter security systems and electric gate opener systems and accessories 
the perimeter security system is designed to deter  detect  delay  assess and respond to intrusions or escapes in a wide range of applications including utilities  airports  correctional facilities and other commercial and government properties 
the company completed initial systems deliveries of its guard tower perimeter fence security system in fiscal and initial deliveries if its patent pending rapid pulse energizer system in fiscal the company continues to work to establish its non lethal electric fencing and its patented guard tower product lines in targeted market applications  primarily through its us and uk sales channels 
products comprising the automatic gate opener systems and accessories targeting the do it yourself traditional zareba market are sold through existing retail channels in north america and the uk  often to the same customer that purchased products of the traditional zareba product line 
during the second half of fiscal  the company began shipping a new family of professional series automatic gate openers ps ago available to the professional installer distribution channels  targeting market growth opportunities 
in response to changing market and competitive conditions  the company discontinued the sales of the ps ago products in june and commenced efforts to sell the product line 
this decision will allow the company to focus more on the 
table of contents company s core products and established distribution channels  while continuing to evaluate and develop its perimeter security products initiative 
in august  the company completed the sale of the company s waters medical systems  inc  wms subsidiary  exiting the medical products market 
in the years prior to the sale  wms had represented a diminishing portion of the company s total business and accounted for less than of the company s revenue 
wms was no longer compatible with the strategic direction of the company and the divestiture provided the company cash while allowing the company to focus on its single core segment 
zareba systems business is seasonal  with peak customer demand occurring in the late spring  summer and early autumn months 
backlog is not significant in either of the company s operating units since most orders are filled within days after receipt of a customer s order 
as a result of zareba systems seasonality  there is a resulting variability in sales  manufacturing fixed overhead absorption and a further resulting impact on gross margin  working capital and cash flow during the company s fiscal year 
results of continuing operations net sales for fiscal year ended june   decreased to million compared to million in fiscal year decreased electric fencing sales in north america and decreased security product sales were partially offset by increased sales in europe 
the decrease in north american fencing systems sales resulted primarily from the impact of the economic downturn in the us and the late spring in north america which delayed the buying season for our fencing systems 
the decrease in security product sales is attributed to a large order to a single customer in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal the difference in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound sterling was the primary reason for the increased sales in europe 
in light of the current economic conditions in its primary markets  the company does not anticipate significant changes in its revenue levels in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross margins decreased to from in fiscal year fiscal year margins benefited from a greater mix of higher margin security product sales 
additionally  increased costs of certain materials  primarily petroleum based products and steel products in fiscal further contributed to the gross margin decrease from fiscal the company implemented sales price increases near the end of fiscal to offset the impact of recent material cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal years approximately million of the increase resulted from severance costs associated with executive management changes and million were non cash option cancellation costs under fas r

the revaluation had no impact on the company s tangible net book value  liquidity or debt covenant measurements 
interest expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal year decreased debt levels created by the proceeds from the sale of the wms subsidiary and favorable interest rate movements in the market place and from the company s new debt facility in fiscal were the primary contributors to the decrease in interest expense

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting polices are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of a customer arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
sales are not conditional based on customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
the company primarily utilizes independent manufacturers representatives to facilitate sales orders with no right of return or other company obligation  as well as having direct sales for key accounts or product lines 
the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to the customer 
customer rebate programs are offered based upon purchasing volume  on a percentage of sales basis 
the company accounts for customer rebates as a reduction to net sales on the accrual basis  in the period of the corresponding sale  when they are probable and can be estimated 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based upon historical experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate based on specifically identified accounts 
the company evaluates specific accounts where information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations is known 
in these cases  management uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
such a change in estimated recoverability would be accounted for in the period in which the facts that give rise to the change become known 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and overhead 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
provisions to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market are made based on a review of excess and obsolete inventories through an examination of historical component consumption  current market demands and shifting product technology 
significant assumptions with respect to market trends are utilized to formulate our provision methods 
sudden or downward changes in markets we serve may cause us to record additional inventory revaluation charges in future periods 
amortization of intangible assets customer relationships and non compete agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over seven and five years  respectively 
intangible assets are amortized on a basis that corresponds to the company s projections of future cash flows directly related to these intangible assets 
the estimates that are included in its projection of future cash flows are based on the best available information at the time of the determination of useful life and amortization method 
a change in circumstances could result in a determination that the related assets are impaired and impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including identifiable intangibles  for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the associated discounted cash flows 
under sfas no 
 the company currently evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets trademarks for impairment using a two step test based upon a fair value approach 
the first step is used to identify a potential impairment through an estimate of the fair value of certain reporting units as defined by sfas no 
 while the second step calculates the amount of impairment  if any 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using the method described in the preceding paragraph and determines the fair value of its reporting units by application of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the company makes estimates that are included in its discounted cash flow analyses based upon the best available information at the time of the fair value determination 
if circumstances change  the estimates of fair value will also change and could necessitate additional impairment charges that reduce the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets 

table of contents at june   the company completed its annual impairment tests for acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using methodologies consistent with those applied for its transitional impairment tests performed as of july  such testing resulted in no impairment charge 
after completing step one of the annual impairment test as of june   the company determined that the estimated fair value of the company was less than the net book value  requiring the completion of the second step of the impairment test 
based on the step two of the analysis prepared as of june   the company determined that the entire amount of goodwill was impaired 
accordingly  the company reduced goodwill to zero in the fourth quarter of fiscal see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies  including legal claims  in the normal course of business 
we accrue for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and can be estimated
