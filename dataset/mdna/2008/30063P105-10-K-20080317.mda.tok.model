item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation develops proprietary dna based technologies for use in the detection of cancer 
we have selected colorectal cancer as the first application of our technologies 
we have licensed certain of our technologies  including improvements to such technologies  on an exclusive basis through december to laboratory corporation of america holdings  or labcorp  for use in a commercial testing service developed and sold by labcorp under the name pregen plus 
pregen plus is labcorp s non invasive  stool based dna testing service for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
our version technology is the basis for labcorp s pregen plus test 
since our inception in february  our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening technologies  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  pursuing reimbursement for stool based dna screening with third party payors  including the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  conducting market studies and analyzing various markets for our technologies  raising capital  licensing our proprietary technologies to labcorp and others  working to further the adoption of stool based dna testing for colorectal cancer  including seeking inclusion of such technology in the guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  pursuing us food and drug administration  or fda  clearance or approval  or exemptions therefrom for our stool based dna screening technology for colorectal cancer  and working with labcorp on activities in support of the commercialization of pregen plus and version we have generated limited operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research  development  and clinical study initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of personnel  the initiation of marketing programs and  prior to august   the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization of stool based dna screening 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years and we may never achieve profitability 
labcorp launched pregen plus commercially in august from the date of launch through december   labcorp had accessioned approximately  pregen plus samples  including approximately   and  samples during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to our version technology underlying the pregen plus testing service offered by labcorp  we have also developed a version colorectal cancer screening technology that we believe has greater sensitivity and is more cost effective than version in a recent research study evaluating stool based dna in patients with confirmed colorectal cancer and colonoscopically normal individuals  our version stool based dna technology demonstrated sensitivity of percent and specificity of percent for the detection of colorectal cancer 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we are in discussions with labcorp  the exclusive licensee to our version technology  regarding the potential future commercialization of version to increase market adoption of our stool based dna screening technologies  we have focused our efforts on the achievement of the following corporate goals obtaining fda clearance for our stool based dna screening technologies  obtaining formal acceptance of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  and leveraging labcorp s large sales force to increase sales and marketing efforts for pregen plus and  if commercialized  version colorectal cancer screening guidelines professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the united states  including those of the american cancer society  or acs  the american college of gastroenterology  and the american gastroenterological association  recommend regular screening by a variety of methods 
historically  such recommendations consisted of colonoscopy  flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing  or fobt  as well as combinations of some of these methods 
on march   the acs and the us multi society task force on colorectal cancer  or mstf crc  a consortium of several organizations including representatives of the american college of gastroenterology  american gastroenterological association  american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy and the american college of physicians society of internal medicine  announced that non invasive  stool based dna screening technology has been included in the updated national colorectal cancer screening guidelines as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk  asymptomatic individuals age and above 
pregen plus is therefore now the first dna based  non invasive colorectal cancer screening test to be included in the colorectal cancer screening guidelines of the acs and mstf crc in the united states for the average risk population 
while we view inclusion of our stool based dna technology in the acs and mstf crc guidelines as a critical first step toward building sufficient demand for pregen plus  we believe that fda clearance for our current and future technologies  and reimbursement from cms and other third party payors will be necessary in order to achieve significant increases in demand for our technologies 
government regulation on october  the fda sent a warning letter to us indicating that pregen plus is a class iii medical device and that it cannot be commercially distributed without an appropriate pre market approval or clearance from the fda 
we have met with the fda on two separate occasions to specifically address the matters raised in the warning letter 
based on these discussions  we are currently focusing our efforts on concluding the pre investigational device exemption  or pre ide  process with the fda and potentially filing of a de novo k with the fda on our version technology 
there can be no assurance that any version of our stool based dna technology will be cleared or approved by the fda  that our proposed de novo k approach will satisfy the fda s regulatory requirements for our version technology or any subsequent version of our technology  or that such fda clearance or approval process can be completed without significant delays or material additional expense resulting from additional fda required clinical or other studies 
we may not have sufficient funds to complete any fda regulatory clearance or approval process for our dna based technologies 
in addition  we may delay any such process to preserve funds for on going operations or otherwise 
moreover  we will require the support of third parties to assist us in the achievement of objectives relating to fda clearance of our technologies  which may be costly 
ongoing compliance with fda regulations will also increase the cost of conducting our business  subject us and labcorp to inspection by fda and to the requirements of fda and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements 
moreover  we cannot assure you that the commercial sales of pregen plus will not be delayed  halted or prevented during the regulatory approval process 
additionally  labcorp could decide to stop offering the current version of pregen plus  could decide not to launch the version technology  or could decide to defer any potential future launch of the version technology until that version has been approved or cleared by the fda  if ever  any of which would materially increase our costs  limit our revenue and cause material harm to our business and result in impairments of our fixed assets or capitalized patent portfolio million at december  and result in personnel of facility related restructuring charges 
reimbursement an important component of our reimbursement strategy is to obtain a national coverage determination  or ncd  from cms for inclusion of our stool based dna screening technologies for colorectal cancer in the medicare program 
in december  we submitted our application for a ncd on our version technology  which was accepted by cms on august  following acceptance of our application to cms  we received the warning letter from the fda 
based in part on the fda s determination as set forth in the warning letter that our version technology required premarket clearance or approval  cms issued a proposed decision memorandum regarding our application on january   which proposed not to provide coverage for our version technology 
the proposed decision memo indicated that cms would reconsider our application for coverage following any such fda clearance or approval of our dna screening technology 
accordingly  we intend to submit our ncd application for reconsideration following any such fda clearance or approval of our technology 
there can be no assurance that any version of our technology will be cleared or approved by the fda 
even if cleared or approved by the fda  there can be no assurance that cms will reach a positive coverage decision regarding our request for an ncd for any version of our technologies 
moreover  even if cms issues a positive coverage decision for any version of our stool based dna screening technology  such coverage may not provide adequate levels of reimbursement 
accordingly  we are also working to accumulate additional performance data and patient compliance and preference data to submit to cms with our request for reconsideration of our ncd application 
we could incur significant time and costs to accumulate such additional data to obtain a positive coverage decision from cms at acceptable reimbursement levels 
additionally  despite the fact that our technology is included in the acs and mstf crc guidelines  the fda warning letter may have a similar impact on private third party payors in that those payors may defer reimbursement policy decisions with respect to our technology until we obtain fda clearance for our technologies  if ever 
other factors affecting potential revenue growth we believe that substantial funds and managerial attention will likely need to be invested in sales and marketing efforts over the next several years for our stool based dna screening technologies 
we do not have  and we cannot assure you that labcorp will devote  the funds or management resources that we believe are likely necessary to build sufficient demand for pregen plus 
despite the inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  we do not expect material revenue growth until such time as fda clearance or approval is obtained  reimbursement is provided by medicare and other third party payors at an acceptable level and sufficient funds and managerial time are invested in sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  we believe our success will also depend upon a number of additional factors that are largely out of our control  including the following the impact that the inclusion of stool based dna screening in guidelines will have on prescribing physicians  third party payors  including cms  and health care consumers  any regulatory restrictions placed upon pregen plus or any other product based on our technologies  whether labcorp continues to offer pregen plus commercially or commercially launches a testing service based on our version technology  success in educating third party payors  managed care organizations  and technology assessment groups regarding stool based dna screening  effective negotiation and contracting by us and labcorp with medicare and other third party payors for coverage at acceptable levels of reimbursement for stool based dna screening  patient acceptance of stool based dna screening  including its novel sample collection process  the absence of competing technologies that offer equal or better attributes than stool based dna screening  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  and the quality and service of the labcorp testing process 
our revenue is comprised of the amortization of up front license fees for the licensing of certain patent rights to labcorp under our strategic license agreement  product royalty fees on pregen plus tests sold by labcorp  and product revenue from the sale to labcorp of effipure components  which are used by labcorp in processing pregen plus tests 
we expect that product royalty fees for will be materially consistent with amounts recorded in as a result of potential third party royalty obligations in connection with our amended license agreement with labcorp 
in addition  as a result of the amendment to our license agreement with labcorp  which also extended the exclusive license period under our agreement with labcorp  we expect that license fee revenue for will be lower than amounts recorded in as a result of the extended amortization period over which our remaining deferred revenue will be amortized 
see amendments to labcorp license agreement below for a discussion of recent modifications to our license agreement with labcorp 
labcorp informed the fda during that they were working on changes to pregen plus that would eliminate the use of effipure in pregen plus 
we  therefore  do not expect to record material revenues from the sale of effipure components to labcorp during the potential loss of this revenue is not expected to have a material impact on our total revenues 
in this regard  labcorp s supply of effipure includes components that have a finite useful life the duration of which  we believe  may be nearly exhausted 
we also believe that inventory levels at labcorp relating to other components necessary for the ongoing commercialization of version of pregen plus may also be nearly exhausted 
if labcorp is unable or unwilling to extend the useful life of these components or acquire new components  then labcorp may be unable to continue to process pregen plus tests in the near term 
any such interruption in the commercial availability of pregen plus could have a materially adverse affect on our business 
amendments to labcorp license agreement second amendment to labcorp license agreement on june   we entered into a second amendment  or second amendment  to our license agreement with labcorp 
the second amendment modified labcorp s exclusive rights to our dna technology for colorectal cancer screening to permit us to license our technology to select third party organizations and commercial service laboratories  subject to labcorp s preferential pricing terms  and to extend labcorp s modified exclusive period under the amendment until december  additionally  the second amendment clarifies the rights and obligations with respect to our version technology for colorectal cancer screening 
the second amendment also revised certain milestone and royalty obligations of labcorp 
the milestones were revised to eliminate milestone payments aggregating million based upon policy level reimbursement approval from key payors including medicare and the inclusion of stool based dna screening in clinical practice guidelines 
as revised  we may be eligible for up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments  all of which now relate to the achievement of significant sales thresholds 
royalties due to us under the second amendment are equal to of labcorp s net revenues from tests performed using our dna technology licensed under the second amendment  and could increase to if labcorp achieves a significant annual pregen plus net revenue threshold 
labcorp also retains preferential pricing terms over third party organizations and commercial service laboratories to which we may license our dna technology for colorectal cancer screening 
the second amendment also eliminated our approximately million contingent liability to labcorp resulting from a certain third party royalty obligation of labcorp 
under the terms of the second amendment  we will potentially be obligated to reimburse labcorp for certain third party royalty payments if labcorp s third party royalty rate is greater than a specified royalty rate during the measuring period  as outlined in the table below 
our liability to pay labcorp pursuant to this provision of the second amendment is based on labcorp s sales volumes of pregen plus during three separate measurement periods  as defined below 
a significant increase in pregen plus test sales volumes during any measurement period  as compared to historical sales pregen plus sales levels volumes  could reduce our potential obligation to zero during any measurement period  while test volumes consistent with historical pregen plus sales levels could result in aggregate payments to labcorp totaling up to million over the measurement periods 
until sales of pregen plus increase to a level that would reduce this potential maximum obligation  if ever  we intend to record the estimated obligation under this provision of the second amendment as a reduction in the product royalty fee line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on low anticipated pregen plus sales volumes prior to any potential fda approval of our technology  as of december   we have accrued million of the total potential million obligation related to the first measurement period  which ends in december this charge was recorded under the caption product royalty fees in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  this obligation is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption third party royalty obligation 
measurement period start date measurement period end date potential minimum third party royalty obligation during measurement period potential maximum third party royalty obligation during measurement period june  december   january  december   january  december   in addition  as a result of extending the exclusive license period from august to december  the amortization of the remaining deferred revenue as of the date of the second amendment million related to up front technology license fees received from labcorp is amortized on a straight line basis over the extended exclusive license period beginning in the quarter ended september  additionally  pursuant to the second amendment  we could be obligated to reimburse labcorp for certain costs related to effipure  up to a maximum of million during the term of the exclusive period 
we recorded a liability of  pursuant to this provision of the second amendment during the year ended december  under the caption cost of product revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
the second amendment also provided labcorp with termination rights if stool based dna colorectal cancer screening is not accepted as standard of care in the near term  if our version technology is not commercially launched in the near term  or if our version technology does not attain certain sensitivity and specificity thresholds during technology validation 
third amendment to labcorp license agreement on august   we entered into the third amendment  or third amendment  to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp 
the third amendment  among other things  added a potential million milestone payment for which we may be eligible 
the milestone payment is based upon specified minimum policy level reimbursement approval from medicare  inclusion of stool based dna screening in clinical practice guidelines and the achievement of certain increases in sales levels of pregen plus over a defined measuring period 
in addition  the third amendment provided that labcorp will assume sole responsibility  at its expense  for all commercial activities related to labcorp s stool based dna testing service 
in accordance with the foregoing  labcorp also agreed to offer at will employment to certain of our former personnel 
fourth amendment to labcorp license agreement on march   we entered into the fourth amendment  or fourth amendment  to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp 
among other things  the fourth amendment further clarified certain license rights of the parties  amended labcorp s termination rights relating to the failure to launch our version technology and restricted certain of our termination rights in the event the fda limits labcorp s ability to market products that incorporate technology licensed to labcorp under our amended license agreement 
in addition  the fourth amendment eliminated certain of our termination rights for a specified period of time during which labcorp is not marketing any stool based dna test for colorectal cancer as a result of preparing for a commercial launch of a stool based dna test for colorectal cancer based on our version technology 
our cost structure in october and again in july  we initiated cost reduction plans and reduced our workforce and other operating expenses  which we refer to as the restructuring and the restructuring  respectively  to help preserve our cash resources 
the restructuring eliminated positions  or of our staff at that time  across all departments 
as part of the restructuring  we eliminated our sales and marketing functions  terminated six employees  and subleased a portion of our leased space at our corporate headquarters 
since these restructurings  our efforts have focused on the pursuit of inclusion of stool based dna testing in screening guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  including the guidelines of the acs and mstf crc  medicare coverage pursuit for stool based dna testing  optimization and validation of our version technology and  most recently  fda clearance or approval of our stool based dna screening technologies 
we continue to assess our facility needs and other operating costs and  as a result  could incur additional restructuring charges in the event we undertake additional activities to reduce facility or other operating costs 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  research and clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies and  effective as of january   non cash stock based compensation recorded pursuant to sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
while we took steps in and to lower research and development costs by focusing primarily on our version technology  we may need to invest substantial funds in additional research  design and development  or clinical or other studies that may be required for fda approval or clearance of our stool based dna screening technologies  and to successfully commercialize the technology that is the basis for the pregen plus testing service  or any current or future versions of our technologies or products 
in this regard  the costs of reproducibility  or other studies  that may be required by the fda in connection with our proposed de novo k pre market clearance notice for our version and any subsequent filings for other versions of our technologies are expected to be material 
we therefore expect that our research and development costs in could be materially higher than levels  depending on the scope of studies required by the fda 
see discussion of the fda status of our technology in government regulation above 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses  professional fees and  as of january   non cash stock based compensation recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r 
as a result of the restructuring  in which we eliminated our sales and marketing functions effective august   we do not expect to incur material sales and marketing operating expenses in we expect general and administrative expenses in to be higher than levels  primarily as a result of increased professional fees during as in connection with our ongoing efforts to obtain fda regulatory clearance or approval of our dna based technologies 
significant accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we amended our exclusive license agreement with labcorp which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we amortize the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the second amendment million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ends in december product royalty fees prior to the effective date of the second amendment  our product royalty fees were based on a specified contractual percentage of labcorp s cash receipts from performing pregen plus tests 
accordingly  we recorded product royalty fees based on this specified percentage of labcorp s cash receipts  as reported to us each month by labcorp 
subsequent to the effective date of the second amendment  our product royalty fees are based on a specified contractual percentage of labcorp s net revenues from sales of pregen plus 
accordingly  subsequent to the effective date of the second amendment  we record product royalty fees based on the specified contractual percentage of labcorp s net revenues from sales of pregen plus  as reported to us each month by labcorp 
the current royalty rate is  subject to increase to in the event that labcorp achieves a specified significant threshold of annual net revenues from the sales of pregen plus 
additionally  pursuant to the second amendment  we will potentially be obligated to reimburse labcorp for certain third party royalty payments  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report 
to the extent we incur liabilities in connection with this provision of the second amendment  the accretion of such liabilities will be recorded as a reduction in the product royalty fee line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
product revenue product revenue from the sale of certain components of our effipure technology to labcorp is recognized upon transfer of the components provided that title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
other revenue revenue from milestone and other performance based payments will be recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable 
patent costs 
patent costs are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets  or sfas no 
 which requires us to continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
such events may include whether stool based dna screening is included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines or a change in the regulatory requirements for pregen plus 
we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december  stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r did not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas no 
 as originally issued and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
critical accounting estimate third party royalty obligation 
under the terms of our amended license agreement with labcorp  we are potentially liable to reimburse labcorp for a certain third party royalty payment made by labcorp in connection with its sales of pregen plus 
our potential liability is described under the section amendments to labcorp license agreement above 
in connection with this obligation  we recorded charges of million under the caption product royalty fees in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  this obligation is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption third party royalty obligation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the interpretation effective january  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab no 
sab no 
provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects on each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
sab no 
permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
the adoption of sab no 
in the first quarter of fiscal did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
provides entities with an option to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
if elected  an entity must report unrealized gains and losses on the item in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for the company in we are currently evaluating if we will elect the fair value option for any of our eligible financial instruments and other items and currently  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently analyzing the effect  if any  eitf will have on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fees associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ends in december and  to a lesser extent  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus  and sales of effipure units to labcorp 
the decrease in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december   was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately million in non cash license fee amortization revenue resulting from the second amendment  which extended the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp from august to december as a result of this extension  the remaining unamortized up front license fees that labcorp previously paid to us million at the time of the second amendment are now being recognized over a longer period of time  resulting in lower non cash license fee amortization as compared to prior periods 
in addition  product royalty revenues were million lower for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december   due to charges of million recorded in the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations in the year ended december  in connection with a certain third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp 
these charges to product royalty revenue were recorded pursuant to the second amendment and resulted in negative product royalty revenue for the year ended december  our obligation to pay labcorp under this provision of our amended license agreement is based on labcorp s sales volumes of pregen plus during three measurement periods over the exclusive license period  which ends in december a significant increase in pregen plus test sales volumes during any of the measurement periods described under the heading amendments to labcorp license agreement above could reduce our obligation related to that period  while test volumes consistent with historical pregen plus sales levels could result in aggregate payments to labcorp of up to million over the remaining exclusive license period 
based on sales volumes that we anticipate in light of the current regulatory and reimbursement status of our technology  as of december   we have accrued million of the total potential million obligation related to the first measurement period  which ends in december future increases in this obligation  to the extent necessary  will continue to be recorded as charges to the product royalty revenue line item of our consolidated statements of operations 
during  labcorp informed the fda that it was working on changes to pregen plus that could eliminate the use of effipure 
we  therefore  do not expect to record material revenues from the sale of effipure components to labcorp during or beyond 
the loss of this revenue during is not expected to have a material impact on our total revenues 
the prospective impact of our amended license agreement with labcorp on our license fee revenue and our product royalty fee revenue is described above 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total cost of revenue includes both the cost of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the cost of product royalty revenue owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
during  we recorded charges to cost of revenue of approximately million as a result of labcorp s decision to discontinue use of effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests 
these write offs resulted in the decrease in cost of revenue when comparing the year ended december  to december  there can be no assurance that labcorp will be able to identify an alternative process for effipure in connection with labcorp s processing of the pregen plus test  which could result in interruption in the pregen plus testing service and could materially harm our business 
there can also be no assurance that labcorp will cease using effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests if labcorp does not have a suitable alternative to effipure in place 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our effipure inventory was under the terms of the second amendment  we may be obligated to pay labcorp up to a maximum of million in connection with certain costs related to effipure   of which was charged to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended september  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the cost reduction plan undertaken in connection with the restructuring 
pursuant to the restructuring  we took actions to reduce our headcount across all departments in order to lower our overall cost structure and focused our research and development organization on the optimization and validation of our version technology 
included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were decreases of million in personnel related expenses  million in laboratory operating costs  million in laboratory supplies  million in non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee option awards  and million in clinical study expenses  all of which resulted from the restructuring activities discussed above 
these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in licensing costs of million  related primarily to licenses for our version technology 
this increase included approximately million in non cash stock based compensation recorded in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock to oncomethylome sciences sa  or oms  on june  pursuant to the terms of a manufacturing and supply agreement with oms 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of the elimination of our sales and marketing functions effective august   as described under the heading restructuring below 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in non cash stock based compensation expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of  shares of previously unvested stock options  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  held by don m 
hardison  our former president and chief executive officer  as well as the extension of the expiration date of all of mr 
hardison s outstanding options  covering an aggregate of  shares  through august  mr 
hardison resigned from the company effective august   and  pursuant to a separation agreement between us and mr 
hardison  mr 
hardison is prohibited from selling  prior to august   any of the shares of common stock obtained upon the exercise of any accelerated stock options 
in connection with these stock option modifications  we recorded one time stock based compensation charges of approximately million in the quarter ended september  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses was an increase in professional fees of million in connection with our ongoing regulatory efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in salary  benefit and other costs due to a reduction in general and administrative headcount during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  restructuring 
during the third quarter of  in connection with the third amendment  we terminated five employees and one employee effective august  and october   respectively 
the restructuring was principally designed to eliminate our sales and marketing functions to reduce costs and help preserve our cash resources 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the three months ended september  primarily related to one time termination benefits arising under retention and severance agreements with each of the terminated employees 
since the restructuring  our efforts have been focused on the pursuit of inclusion of stool based dna testing in screening guidelines of the major guidelines organizations  including the guidelines that resulted from the joint efforts of the acs and the mstf crc  medicare coverage pursuit for stool based dna testing  validation and optimization of our version technology  and the pursuit of fda clearance for our stool based dna screening technologies 
restructuring charges recorded during the third quarter of of million included million in severance and related benefit costs expected to be paid in cash through may  and million in non cash stock based compensation charges 
we extended by nine months  to august   the expiration date of stock options to purchase up to  shares  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  held by employees that were terminated as a part of the restructuring 
pursuant to the measurement provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded one time non cash stock based compensation charges of million in connection with these stock option modifications in our consolidated statements of operations during the quarter ended september  see note to our consolidated financials statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of these stock option modifications 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a sublease agreement  or the sublease agreement  to sublease approximately  square feet of rentable area in our corporate headquarters 
the term of the sublease agreement  which commenced on december   is months with a base rent of  per year 
the subtenant has no rights to renew or extend the sublease agreement 
under the terms of the sublease agreement  the subtenant was required to provide a security deposit of  and will be required to pay its pro rata share of any building operating expenses and real estate taxes 
we believe that our remaining  square feet of leased space is adequate for our current requirements 
in connection with the sublease agreement  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the fourth quarter of included opposite the caption facility consolidation costs in the table below  which consist of approximately million in future cash payments related to the difference between our committed lease payments and the estimated sublease rental income under the sublease agreement and approximately million of non cash charges related to the write off of leasehold improvements abandoned in connection with the sublease agreement 
our decision to enter into the sublease agreement was deemed to be an impairment indicator under sfas no 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  asset impairment charges of million were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
facility consolidation costs also include one time real estate transaction fees in connection with the sublease agreement 
amounts remaining in the restructuring accrual at december   which are expected to be paid out through july  are recorded under the caption accrued expenses in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
the right of terminated employees to continue to receive severance payments from us will be dependent upon when  and if  the terminated employees secure employment with another employer during the defined severance period and  therefore  our estimate of the total restructuring charges may be adjusted in future periods 
the following table summarizes the restructuring activities during the year ended december  amounts included in the table are in thousands 
type of liability balance  december  charges cash payments non cash write offs balance  december  employee separation costs facility consolidation costs total the charges outlined in the table above exclude million in non cash stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the stock option modifications discussed above 
we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet specified requirements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  all of our revenues are derived from our license agreement with labcorp 
revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ends in august  and  to a lesser extent  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus and sales of effipure units to labcorp 
the increase in total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a one time  non cash reduction in revenue of million recorded in june in connection with the amendment of a warrant issued to labcorp in june to purchase  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
at the time of issuance  the labcorp warrant had an expiration date of june  on june   we entered into an amendment to the warrant to extend the expiration date to august   which is the expiration date of the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp 
all other terms of the warrant were unaffected 
we assigned a value to the warrant extension of million using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  we recorded the cost of the warrant extension as a one time  non cash reduction in license fee revenue of million in the quarter ended june  during  labcorp informed the fda that it was working on changes to pregen plus that could eliminate the use of effipure 
we  therefore  do not expect to record material revenues from the sale of effipure components to labcorp during or beyond 
the loss of this revenue beginning in is not expected to have a material impact on our gross margins because  under our agreement with labcorp  our effipure sales to labcorp resulted in no gross margin as labcorp reimbursed us only for our costs to provide effipure to them 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue includes both the cost of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the cost of product royalty revenue owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
total cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the cost of product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily the result of higher write offs of effipure inventory 
we wrote off million and million in excess effipure inventory during the years ended december  and  respectively 
specifically  we wrote off approximately million in excess effipure inventory units during the quarter ended march  as a result of labcorp s decision to discontinue use of effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests beyond during the development of the manufacturing and supply chain processes for effipure components  we entered into agreements with certain suppliers and contract manufactures to produce components utilized in effipure 
certain of these supply agreements included minimum purchase commitments to be fulfilled by us over the life of the agreements  the last of which expired in april as of december   the carrying value of our effipure inventory was there can be no assurance that labcorp will be able to identify an alternative process for effipure in connection with labcorp s processing of the pregen plus test  which could result in interruption in the pregen plus testing service and could materially harm our business 
there can also be no assurance that labcorp will cease using effipure in the processing of pregen plus tests in if labcorp does not have a suitable alternative to effipure in place 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the completion of the primary clinical study supporting version of our stool based dna technology in late  resulting in lower research and development expenses in the year ended december  as compared to the same period of in addition  as described under the heading restructuring below  we took actions in october to reduce our headcount across all departments in order to lower our overall cost structure 
this restructuring drove the reduction in research and development costs when comparing the year ended december  to december  included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   were decreases of million in personnel related expenses  million in clinical study expenses  million related to laboratory space and million in laboratory supplies 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of the adoption of sfas no r on january  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of a reduction in the size of our sales and marketing force from seventeen employees at december  to five employees at december  we also reduced our external advertising  marketing and promotional spending by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these reductions reflect a focus on spending primarily on those initiatives that directly or indirectly support guidelines inclusion  as well as a shift away from direct marketing to physicians to third party payor groups  self insured employers and technology assessment groups 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of as a result of the adoption of sfas no r on january  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in stock based compensation expense recorded in the year ended december   as compared to the same period of  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  also included in the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were increases in professional fees of million  and personnel related expenses of million resulting from the accrual of retention bonuses in the fourth quarter of restructuring restructuring 
on october   we initiated a plan to reduce our cost structure by eliminating positions  or of our staff  across all departments to reduce expenses 
this workforce reduction reflects our intention to reduce employee related costs  as well as our overall research and development and sales and marketing costs  in order to preserve existing cash and cash equivalents 
pursuant to the restructuring  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended december  in connection with one time employee termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
amounts remaining in the restructuring accrual at december  are expected to be paid out through september and are recorded under the caption accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at december  amounts included in the table are in thousands

in february  we took steps to focus our research and development efforts primarily on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of our technology and reduced our cost structure accordingly 
we discontinued certain research efforts  reduced our workforce by ten employees  principally in the research and development functions  and amended the lease for our corporate headquarters in marlborough  ma to reduce the total space leased at the facility from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended march  as of june  all liabilities related to the restructuring had been paid

our decision to reduce the total space leased and abandon the related leasehold improvements was deemed to be an impairment indicator under sfas no 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  asset impairment charges of million included opposite the caption facility consolidation costs in the table above were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
facility consolidation costs also include one time real estate transaction fees in connection with the lease amendment to reduce the space occupied at our corporate headquarters 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of  partially offset by lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  public offerings of common stock in february and february and cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in restricted cash  which has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit in connection with the lease for our marlborough  massachusetts facility 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as well as for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to decreases in sales and marketing and applied research spending as a result of multiple restructuring and cost reduction actions taken during and  which are discussed elsewhere in this report 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million in each of the years ended december  and purchases of property and equipment of million during the year ended december  were materially consistent with purchases of property and equipment for the years ended december  and excluding activities that may be required by the fda  we expect that purchases of property and equipment during will be consistent with amounts invested during  although studies required by the fda in connection with our technologies may require that we purchase additional property and equipment in we reduced the expenditures related to our capitalized patent portfolio for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and  and we expect that investments made in our patent portfolio during will be materially consistent with amounts invested during net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and was the result of decreases in restricted cash in connection with the lease for our corporate headquarters and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  that includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
the explanatory paragraph states the following condition  which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we have incurred recurring operating losses and we do not have enough cash resources to support future operations without obtaining additional financing 
as a result of the restructuring actions taken in and  we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund our current operations through this projection is based on our current cost structure and our current expectations regarding the cost and timing of studies and other requirements that we believe are likely to obtain fda regulatory clearance for our version technology 
we have not yet reached final agreement with the fda regarding any studies that would be necessary for the clearance or approval of version of our dna based technology  and the costs of any such studies could require us to obtain additional funding or engage in a strategic collaboration with a third party before previously expected 
we do not expect that product royalty payments or milestone payments from labcorp will materially supplement our liquidity position in the next twelve months  if at all 
under the terms of our amended license agreement with labcorp  we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of million in milestone payments  primarily all of which relates to the achievement of certain significant cumulative labcorp sales thresholds that depend upon labcorp s widespread success with respect to its sales of pregen plus 
because these milestone payments are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all  we do not believe that any payments pursuant to our agreement with labcorp will be sufficient or timely enough to meet our liquidity needs 
since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  we will have to raise additional monies during through the sale of debt or equity securities  collaborations with third parties or other strategic opportunities  if any  to continue our business operations beyond the end of our fiscal year 
we cannot assure you that any of these alternatives will be successful  or even available  or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
if we are unable to obtain the required funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of any financing or other strategic opportunities that may become available to us  we will be required to further reduce the scale of our business operations in which case our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to seek bankruptcy protection 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to continue our operations beyond fiscal  we cannot assure you that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period description total less than one year years years more than years in thousands obligations under license and collaborative agreements     operating lease obligations   purchase obligations total      obligations under license and collaboration agreements represent on going commitments under various research collaborations and licensing agreements 
this category includes a potential obligation to reimburse labcorp for a certain third party royalty  up to an aggregate maximum of million  during three defined measurement periods between june  and december  although payment of this potential obligation is dependent upon labcorp s sales levels of pregen plus during the measurement periods  the total potential million obligation has been included in the table above based on historical sales levels of pregen plus 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough  massachusetts 
purchase obligations primarily represent a potential million obligation to reimburse labcorp for certain costs related to effipure as well as commitments associated with our research and development activities 
we do not have any special purpose entities or any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
our anticipated future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued funding of our development efforts  including product development and fda submissions  clinical and other studies required for such fda submissions and resubmission of our cms application for approval of our technologies  and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
our future capital requirements may depend on many factors  including the following the regulatory requirements for pregen plus  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies  and the timing of any required regulatory approval process  our ability to attract third parties to support the development of an fda cleared or approved product based on our technologies  acceptance  endorsement and formal policy approval of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  our ability to achieve milestones under our strategic agreement with labcorp  a determination that additional studies surrounding our technologies are needed  a sustained level of interest and commitment by labcorp in the commercialization of our technologies  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  threats posed by competing technologies  new out licensing arrangements relating to our technologies  and the successful commercialization and sales growth of pregen plus  or other stool based dna testing services utilizing our technologies 
additionally  if our version technology is not cleared or approved by the fda in the near term  labcorp could decide to stop offering the current version of pre gen plus 
furthermore  labcorp could decide not to launch version of its testing service  or could decide to defer any potential future launch of version of its testing service until that version has been approved or cleared by the fda  if ever 
alternatively  based on a number of factors  including a finite supply of materials required to process version  labcorp may decide to discontinue the use of version of our technologies and convert to the use of version such conversion could result in an interruption in service and a delay during which no version of the test utilizing our technologies remains on the market 
either of these situations will limit our revenue and materially adversely affect our business and cash reserves 
moreover  in a proposed decision memo dated january   cms decided not to provide coverage for version of our technology because it is not cleared or approved by the fda 
while the cms proposed decision memo from january  stated that it would reconsider our application for coverage of version after an fda approval  if ever  cms may decide to reject any subsequent application for payment outright  or may provide reimbursement at low rate that would make commercialization of our technology on a broad scale economically impossible 
additionally  if version  version  or any subsequent versions of our technology are not approved by the fda  such technologies will  we believe  similarly not be approved by cms  each of which will materially adversely affect our business and we may never be successful 
both the fda and cms positions with respect to any of our technologies  at any point in time  could also negatively impact any potential reimbursement of our technologies from third party payors  which would also have a materially adverse affect on our business 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds  all of which are currently invested in the us and are classified as available for sale 
we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
