critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results can and will differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our management believes our critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are our valuation of financial instruments  impairment of goodwill assessment and our use of estimates related to compensation and benefits during the year 

table of contents valuation of financial instruments definition of fair value our financial instruments are primarily recorded at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting policy 
unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in principal transactions in our consolidated statements of earnings 
financial instruments are valued at quoted market prices  if available 
for financial instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values through quoted market prices  the determination of fair value is based upon consideration of available information  including types of financial instruments  current financial information  restrictions on dispositions  fair values of underlying financial instruments and quotations for similar instruments 
certain financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace 
bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others are willing to pay for an asset 
ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others are willing to accept for an asset 
for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bid ask prices  the company does not require that fair value always be a predetermined point in the bid ask range 
our policy is to allow for mid market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value 
for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument  the same price within the bid ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions 
fair value hierarchy we adopted fasb  fair value measurements fasb  as of the beginning of fasb defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
fasb establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date 
the type of financial instruments included in level are highly liquid cash instruments with quoted prices such as g government  agency securities  listed equities and money market securities  as well as listed derivative instruments  level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date 
the nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently  derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market  or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments  the parameters of which can be directly observed 
instruments which are generally included in this category are corporate bonds  convertible bonds  municipal bonds and otc derivatives  level instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date 
these financial instruments do not have two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
instruments that are included in this category generally include certain illiquid equity securities  commercial loans and loan commitments  investments  distressed debt  as well as certain highly structured otc derivative contracts 

table of contents valuation process for financial instruments the overall valuation process for financial instruments may include adjustments to valuations derived from pricing models 
these adjustments may be made when  in management s judgment  either the size of the position in the financial instrument or other features of the financial instrument such as its complexity  or the market in which the financial instrument is traded such as counterparty  credit  concentration or liquidity require that an adjustment be made to the value derived from the pricing models 
an adjustment may be made if a trade of a financial instrument is subject to sales restrictions that would result in a price less than the computed fair value measurement from a quoted market price 
additionally  an adjustment from the price derived from a model typically reflects management s judgment that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would also consider such an adjustment in pricing that same financial instrument 
valuation models used to determine fair value non derivative financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value and categorized as level are generally those that are based on an assessment of each underlying investment  incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties  expected cash flows models  market based information  including comparable company transactions  performance multiples and changes in market outlook  among other factors 
derivative financial instruments are generally those that are marked to model using relevant empirical data to estimate fair value 
the models inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction and outcomes from the models represent an exit price and expected future cash flows 
our valuation models are calibrated to the market on a frequent basis 
the parameters and inputs are adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions 
changes to inputs in valuation models are not changes to valuation methodologies  rather  the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from valuation models in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
controls over valuation of financial instruments our risk management department  independent of the trading function  plays an important role in asserting that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
compensation and benefits the use of estimates is important in determining compensation and benefits expenses for interim and year end periods 
a substantial portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are finalized at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix and our use of equity based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual discretionary bonuses among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  we have generally accrued interim compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios  taking into account the guidance contained in fasb r regarding the timing of expense recognition for non retirement eligible and retirement eligible employees 
our fourth quarter reflects the difference between the compensation and benefits we determine at year end and the accruals recorded through the end of the third quarter 
goodwill impairment at least annually  we are required to assess whether goodwill has been impaired by comparing the estimated fair value  calculated based on earnings and book value multiples  of each business segment with its estimated net book value  by estimating the amount of stockholders equity required to support each reporting unit 
periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether or not an 
table of contents impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge 
we completed our last impairment test on goodwill as of september   and no impairment was identified 
however  our jefferies execution subsidiary recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of jefferies execution is a registered broker dealer 
therefore  goodwill relating to the acquisition of jefferies execution in  formerly helfant group  inc  was pushed down from us to jefferies execution in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
d  push down accounting 
we have two reporting units  capital markets and asset management  as defined by fasb  goodwill and other intangible assets 
jefferies execution is not a reporting unit of ours and we have not recorded this million goodwill impairment charge to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues by source the capital markets reportable segment includes our securities trading  including the results of our recently reorganized high yield secondary market trading activities  and investment banking activities 
the capital markets reportable segment is managed as a single operating segment that provides the sales  trading and origination effort for various fixed income  equity and advisory products and services 
the capital markets segment comprises many divisions  with interactions among each 
in addition  we choose to voluntarily disclose the asset management segment even though it is currently an immaterial non reportable segment as defined by fasb  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for presentation purposes  the remainder of results of operations is presented on a detailed product and expense basis rather than on a business segment basis because the asset management segment is immaterial as compared to the consolidated results of operations 
our earnings are subject to wide fluctuations since many factors over which we have little or no control  particularly the overall volume of trading  the volatility and general level of market prices  and the number and size of investment banking transactions may significantly affect our operations 

table of contents the following provides a summary of revenues by source for the past three years year ended december  of of of net net net amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues dollars in thousands equity fixed income and commodities fixed income excluding high yield and commodities high yield total investment banking asset management fees and investment income from managed funds asset management fees investment income loss from managed funds total interest total revenues interest expense net revenues fixed income and commodities revenue is primarily comprised of investment grade fixed income  convertible and commodities product revenue

first quarter and prior period amounts include asset management revenue from high yield funds 
effective april   with the commencement of our reorganized high yield secondary market trading activities  we do not record asset management revenue associated with these activities 
consolidated results of operations compared to net revenues net revenues increased million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in investment banking revenues and a million  or  increase in equity product revenues  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in fixed income excluding high yield and commodities revenues  a million  or  decrease in high yield revenues and a million  or  decrease in asset management fees and investment income loss from managed funds 
equity product revenue equity product revenue is comprised of equity including principal transactions and commission revenue  correspondent clearing and prime brokerage  and execution product revenues 
equity product revenue was million  up from primarily attributable to strong contributions from our us and international agency cash equity and derivative products offset by principal trading losses from certain derivative and cash proprietary equity trading activities for the later half of the year 
these principal trading losses were caused by illiquidity and volatility in the us equity marketplace 

table of contents fixed income and commodities revenue fixed income and commodities revenue is primarily comprised of high yield secondary market trading activities  investment grade fixed income  convertible and commodities product revenue 
fixed income and commodities revenue was million  down over the decrease was driven by extremely challenging and illiquid us high yield credit markets for the latter half characterized by wider spreads and reduced levels of liquidity  and strong prior period performance in high yield secondary market trading  offset by consistent contributions throughout from our investment grade fixed income products despite a severe decline in fixed income liquidity and a strong fourth quarter performance from jfp due to volatility in energy related commodities markets 
investment banking product revenue year ended december  december  percentage change dollars in thousands capital markets advisory total capital markets revenues  which consists primarily of debt  equity and convertible financing services  were million  an increase of from the increase in capital markets revenues was a result of increased us and international debt underwritings and increased activity from our leverage finance group

the ratio of compensation to net revenues was approximately for as compared to for average employee headcount increased from  during to  during employee headcount increased from  as of december  to  as of december  cash compensation cash compensation and benefits increased million  or  while net revenues increased 
the ratio of cash compensation to net revenues was approximately for as compared to for the ratio of cash compensation to average employee headcount was approximately thousand for as compared to thousand for the increase in cash compensation is primarily due to increased business activities and growth initiatives  both domestically and internationally 
specifically  during we hired numerous senior level employees as part of our growth initiatives requiring us to incur significant upfront cash compensation outflows including sign on and guaranteed bonuses 
issuance of stock based compensation to employees restricted stock and restricted stock units rsu s are an important component of employee compensation 
we believe they motivate employees and encourage long term commitment to us 
restricted stock and rsu s are awarded to employees subject to risk of forfeiture and or vesting conditions 
typically the vesting occurs over a prescribed period of time and requires continued service and employment by the recipient 
restricted stock and rsu s are valued at the date of grant and are amortized over the requisite service period which is typically five years 

table of contents the following table summarizes selected financial ratios related to the issuance of stock based compensation to our employees dollars in thousands stock based compensation net revenues compensation and benefits stock based compensation net revenues stock based compensation compensation and benefits stock based compensation is the pre tax expense associated with all of our employee stock based compensation plans  including the discount on dcp deferred shares  restricted stock amortization  discounts on employee stock purchase plans and esop contributions 
the increase in stock based compensation net revenues and stock based compensation total compensation is primarily due to the increase in the amortization of stock based awards from prior years 
the increase in stock based compensation is consistent with our change in compensation policies initiated during whereby we issue greater amounts of stock based compensation to senior level employees as compared to cash compensation 
the following table summarizes estimated future amortization expense related to the issuance of stock based awards to our employees prior to january  this table does not reflect the potential impact of future grants  modifications  if any  or actual forfeitures in millions total on january  we granted million of rsu s and restricted stock to our employees

table of contents liquidity  financial condition and capital resources our chief financial officer and treasurer are responsible for developing and implementing our liquidity  funding and capital management strategies 
these policies are determined by the nature of our day to day business operations  business growth possibilities  regulatory obligations  and liquidity requirements 
our actual level of capital  total assets  and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors  including  asset composition  business initiatives  regulatory requirements and cost availability of both long term and short term funding 
we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
liquidity the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash  marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time in thousands of dollars december  december  cash and cash equivalents cash in banks money market investments total cash and cash equivalents cash and securities segregated other in accordance with rule c of the securities exchange act of  jefferies  as a broker dealer carrying client accounts  is subject to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of its clients 
items are financial instruments utilized in our overall cash management activities and are readily convertible to cash in normal market conditions 
bank loans represent short term borrowings that are payable on demand and generally bear interest at a spread over the federal funds rate 
we had no outstanding secured bank loans as of december  and unsecured bank loans are typically overnight loans used to finance financial instruments owned or clearing related balances 
we had million and of outstanding unsecured bank loans as of december  and  respectively 
average daily bank loans for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash or assets readily convertible into cash 
the majority of securities positions both long and short in our trading accounts are readily marketable and actively traded 
in addition  receivables from brokers and dealers are primarily current open transactions or securities borrowed transactions  which are typically settled or closed out within a few days 
receivable from customers includes margin balances and amounts due on transactions in the process of settlement 
most of our receivables are secured by marketable securities 

table of contents our assets are funded by equity capital  senior debt  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock  securities loaned  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  customer free credit balances  bank loans and other payables 
bank loans represent temporary usually overnight secured and unsecured short term borrowings  which are generally payable on demand 
we have arrangements with banks for unsecured financing of up to million 
secured bank loans are collateralized by a combination of customer  non customer and firm securities 
we have always been able to obtain necessary short term borrowings in the past and believe that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
additionally  we have million in letters of credit outstanding as of december   which are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities 
excess liquidity our policy is to maintain excess liquidity to cover all expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment 
liquid resources consist of unrestricted cash and unencumbered assets that are readily convertible into cash on a secured basis on short notice 
certain investments are also readily convertible to cash 
in addition  we have  million of unsecured  uncommitted lines of credit with various banks 
management believes these resources provide sufficient excess liquidity to cover all expected cash outflows for one year during a stressed liquidity environment 
expected cash outflows include the payment of interest expense including dividends on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock on our long term debt  the anticipated funding of outstanding investment commitments  the anticipated fixed costs over the next months  potential stock repurchases  and certain accrued expenses and other liabilities 
analysis of financial condition and capital resources financial condition as previously discussed  we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
total assets increased  million  or  from  million at december  to  million at december  primarily due to increased repo activity 
our financial instruments owned  including securities pledged to creditors  increased  million  while our financial instruments sold  not yet purchased decreased million 
our securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased  million  while our securities loaned and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased  million 
level assets  as defined by fasb  decreased to approximately of total financial instruments owned as of december   compared to approximately in the trailing quarter 
the decrease in level assets resulted largely from the repayment of million in bridge loans from investment banking clients in acquisition finance transactions

tangible stockholders equity  pro forma book value per share  tangible book value per share and pro forma tangible book value per share are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap guidance 
we calculate tangible stockholders equity as stockholders equity less intangible assets 
we calculate pro forma book value per share as stockholders equity plus the projected deferred tax benefit on the vested portion of restricted stock and rsus divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for shares not yet issued to the extent of the related expense amortization and shares issued to the extent the related expense has not been amortized 
we calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common stock outstanding 
we calculate pro forma tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity plus the projected deferred tax benefit on the vested portion of restricted stock and rsus by common shares outstanding adjusted for shares not yet issued to the extent of the related expense amortization and shares issued to the extent the related expense has not been amortized 
we consider these ratios as meaningful measurements of our financial condition and believe they provide investors with additional metrics to comparatively assess the fair value of our stock

effects of changes in foreign currency rates we maintain a foreign securities business in our foreign offices london  paris  tokyo and zurich as well as in some of our domestic offices 
most of these activities are hedged by related foreign currency liabilities or by forward exchange contracts 
however  we are still subject to some foreign currency risk 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
effects of inflation based on today s modest inflationary rates and because our assets are primarily monetary in nature  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  financial instruments and receivables  we believe that our assets are not significantly affected by inflation 
the rate of inflation  however  can affect various expenses  including employee compensation  communications and technology and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable in charges for services provided by us 

table of contents risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance  new business  reputational and other 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
we make dealer markets in equity securities  debt securities and commodities 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short positions 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of financial instruments  such as securities and derivatives  held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various trading  investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled transactions ie  securities failed to receive are recorded at the amount for which the securities were purchased  and are paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or dealers 
in the case of aged securities failed to receive  we may purchase the underlying security in the market and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty in accordance with standard industry practices 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 

table of contents in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money laundering and record keeping 
we also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
reputational risk 
we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups 

table of contents accounting and regulatory developments fasb interpretation no 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin as of the beginning of the transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings was a reduction of approximately million 
fasb in september  the fasb issued fasb  fair value measurements fasb 
fasb clarifies that fair value is the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants 
fasb reverses the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
prohibiting the recognition of day one gain or loss on derivative contracts where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
however  fasb requires that a fair value measurement technique include an adjustment for risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model  if market participants would also include such an adjustment 
in addition  fasb prohibits the recognition of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market 
the provisions of fasb are to be applied prospectively  except for changes in fair value measurements that result from the initial application of fasb to existing derivative financial instruments measured under eitf issue no 
and block discounts  which are to be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption 
fasb is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted fasb as of the beginning of to determine the transition adjustment to opening retained earnings  we performed an analysis of existing derivative instruments measured under eitf issue and block discounts  and determined that there was no transition adjustment to opening retained earnings as of january  fasb in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for uncertainty in employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fasb 
fasb improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
this statement also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb fasb required us to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our benefit plan on our december  consolidated statement of financial condition  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
as a result of the pension plan being frozen  the projected benefit obligation was equal to the accumulated benefit obligation 
consequently  no additional adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income was necessary as of december  fasb in february  the fasb issued fasb  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fasb 
this standard permits an entity to measure financial instruments and certain other items at estimated fair value 
most of the provisions of fasb are elective  however  the amendment to fasb  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities that own trading and available for sale securities 
the fair value option created by fasb permits an entity to measure eligible items at fair value as of specified election dates 
the fair value option a may generally be applied instrument by instrument  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c must be applied to the entire instrument and not to only a portion of the instrument 
fasb 
table of contents allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  with the transition adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings 
fasb is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity i makes that choice in the first days of that year  ii has not yet issued financial statements for any interim period of such year  and iii elects to apply the provisions of fasb we adopted fasb as of the beginning of we elected to apply the fair value option on loans and loan commitments made in connection with our investment banking activities loans and loan commitments 
loans and loan commitments are included in financial instruments owned on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
at the time of adoption  we did not have such loans and loan commitments outstanding  therefore there was no transition adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings 
in addition  we elected to apply the fair value option on certain investments held by subsidiaries that are not registered broker dealers as defined in the aicpa audit and accounting guide  brokers and dealers in securities 
these investments had been accounted for by us at fair value prior to the adoption of fasb  therefore  there was no transition adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings related to these investments 
the fair value option was elected for loans and loan commitments and investments held by subsidiaries that are not registered broker dealers because they are risk managed by us on a fair value basis 
fsp fin in april  the fasb issued a staff position fsp fin no 
 amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin no 
defines right of setoff and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff 
it also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position 
in addition  this fsp permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments 
the provisions of this fsp are consistent with our current accounting practice 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application permitted 
the adoption of fsp fin on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
eitf issue no 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue  accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
eitf requires that the tax benefit related to dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified nonvested equity shares  nonvested equity share units  and outstanding equity share options be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
we currently account for this tax benefit as a reduction to income tax expense 
eitf is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after december  we intend to adopt eitf in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf on our results of operations for the first quarter of sop no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk var 
value at risk in general  var measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
we calculate var over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level which implies the potential loss of daily trading revenue is expected to be at least as large as the var amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
var is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of var  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this var estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions  excluding corporate investments in asset management positions  using a historical simulation approach 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk  equity risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk categories 
diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk daily var in millions value at risk in trading portfolios var at year ended year ended risk categories average high low average high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect firmwide var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specific confidence level 
for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon and confidence level were used 
equals the difference between firmwide var and the sum of the vars by risk categories 
this effect is due to the market categories not being perfectly correlated 

table of contents average firmwide var of million during increased from the million average during primarily due to an increase in exposure to equity prices  and interest rates 
the following table presents our daily var over the last four quarters daily var trend chart var back testing the comparison of daily actual revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
a back testing exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated nineteen outliers when comparing the one day var with the back testing profit and loss in ten of the outliers occurred during the third quarter as result of increased market volatility 
a confidence one day var model should not have more than twelve out of days back testing exceptions on an annual basis under normal market conditions 
back testing profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue and includes the profit and loss effects relevant to the var model  excluding fees  commissions and certain provisions 
we compare the trading revenue with var for back testing purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities under normal market conditions 
the graph below illustrates the relationship between daily back testing profit and loss and daily var for us in line graph 
table of contents var is a model that estimates the future risk based on historical data 
we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
in addition  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a one day horizon and might not predict the future position 
when comparing our var numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies could produce significantly different results 
daily trading net revenue in millions bar chart trading revenue used in the histogram below entitled vs 
distribution of daily trading revenue is the actual daily trading revenue which is excluding fees  commissions and certain provisions 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily trading revenue for our trading activities 
table of contents maturity data at december   we had  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  with fixed interest rates 
we previously entered into a fair value hedge with no ineffectiveness using interest rate swaps in order to convert million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due march  into floating rates based upon libor 
during the third quarter of  we terminated these interest rate swaps and received cash consideration less accrued interest of million 
the million basis difference related to the fair value of the interest rate swaps at the time of the termination is being amortized as a reduction in interest expense of approximately million per year over the remaining life of the notes through march the table below provides information about our otc derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and price movements
