item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk  including commodity price risk  weather risk  and interest rate risk 
the following describes the company s exposure to these risks 
commodity price risk about half of southwest s annual normal weather gas supply needs are secured using short duration fixed price contracts one year or less 
for the heating season  fixed price contracts ranged in price from approximately to per dekatherm 
natural gas purchases not covered by fixed price contracts are made under variable price contracts with firm quantities and on the spot market 
prices for these contracts are not known until the month of purchase 
the pga mechanism allows southwest to file to change the gas cost component of the rates charged to its customers to reflect increases or decreases in the price expected to be paid to its suppliers and companies providing interstate pipeline transportation service 
filings to change rates in accordance with pga clauses are subject to audit by state regulatory commission staffs 
pga changes affect cash flows and potentially short term borrowing requirements  but do not directly impact profit margin 
the company does not currently utilize stand alone derivative financial instruments  other than fixed price term and variable rate contracts  for speculative purposes nor does it have trading operations 
in the future  southwest intends to supplement its current volatility mitigation program with stand alone derivative instruments 
the combination of fixed price contracts and derivative instruments should increase flexibility for southwest and increase supplier diversification 
the company intends to pursue the recovery of such costs as part of the pga mechanisms in each jurisdiction 

table of contents weather risk a significant portion of the company s operating margin is volume driven with current rates based on an assumption of normal weather 
demand for natural gas is greatly affected by temperature 
on cold days  use of gas by residential and commercial customers can be six times greater than on warm days because of increased use of gas for space heating 
space heating related volumes are the primary component of billings for these customer classes and are concentrated in the months of november to march 
variances in temperatures from normal levels  especially during these months  have a significant impact on the margin and associated net income of the company 
this impact is most pronounced in arizona  where percent of southwest s customers are located and where rates are highly leveraged 
the company continues to pursue mechanisms in each of its service territories intended to stabilize the recovery of the company s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than normal weather 
in california  southwest has a margin tracker balancing account that mitigates margin volatility due to weather and other usage variations 
in nevada  southwest is authorized to use declining block rates to mitigate weather variations 
in arizona  southwest filed a general rate application in august that includes a revenue decoupling mechanism that would separate the recovery of fixed costs from volumetric usage and a weather normalization mechanism that would  if approved  protect customers from higher bills in extreme cold weather and protect the company from cost under recoveries in unseasonably warm weather 
the company cannot predict whether the filed for changes in arizona will be approved 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings or cash flows 
specific interest rate risks for the company include the risk of increasing interest rates on variable rate obligations 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates 
in nevada  fluctuations in interest rates on variable rate industrial development revenue bonds idrbs are tracked and recovered from ratepayers through an interest balancing account 
as of december  and  southwest had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt outstanding  excluding nevada variable rate idrbs 
assuming a constant outstanding balance in variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million
