table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions 
we provide comprehensive electronics design  production  product management and aftermarket services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn at the time 
in response to this industry and global economic downturn  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
during the third quarter of our fiscal year  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure due to the global economic downturn 
this restructuring program included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
the macroeconomic conditions for us  and the electronic manufacturing services industry as a whole  continued to deteriorate during our fiscal year  resulting in additional restructuring programs being implemented during our fiscal year 
these restructuring programs included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the closure of facilities 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies continued to turn to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
during our fiscal year we initiated a restructuring program to realign our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived market conditions 
over the past four years we have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base through acquisitions and organic growth 
we believe further growth opportunities exist for the industry to penetrate the worldwide electronics markets 
the rate of growth  however  of gross domestic product in the us has recently declined 
while recent economic conditions have not yet had a material negative impact on our results of operations  they may have such an impact over the next several fiscal quarters and possibly beyond 
on september   we reorganized our manufacturing business into a consumer division and an electronic manufacturing services ems division 
based on this reorganization  we currently have three operating segments consumer  ems and aftermarket services ams 
we believe that these divisions provide cost effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions  each with full accountability for design  operations  supply chain management and delivery 
our ams division provides warranty and repair services to customers in a broad range of industries  including certain of our manufacturing customers 
our consumer division has dedicated resources designed to meet the particular needs of the consumer products industry and focuses on cell phones and mobile products  televisions  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers 
our ems division focuses on the traditional and emerging electronic manufacturing services business sectors  including automotive  computing  defense and aerospace  industrial  medical  networking  storage and telecommunications businesses 
see financial information about business segments below 
we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  generally when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 

table of contents our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated statement of earnings 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents summary of results net revenue for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year the increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs  organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model  and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and expansion and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our recent business acquisitions 
additionally  we continue to enhance our business model by adding services in the areas of collaborative design  system integration  order fulfillment and aftermarket 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain higher cost geographies and to properly size our manufacturing sites with perceived current market conditions the restructuring plan 
based on the analysis completed to date  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges as a result of the restructuring plan 
the restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and benefit costs  contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs 
the impairment charges include pre tax fixed asset impairment costs  as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets 
we have substantially completed our restructuring activities under the restructuring plan and currently expect to recognize the remaining costs over the course of fiscal year with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year this information will be subject to the finalization of the timetables for the transitional functions  consultation with employees and their representatives  as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted 
for further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements

the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  certain key operating results and other financial information in thousands  except per share data 
fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days 
table of contents three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
days in accounts receivable increased one day to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter which was primarily due to timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
days in accounts receivable remained consistent at days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in accounts receivable decreased three days to days from the prior sequential quarter and during the three months ended november  days in accounts receivable increased three days to days from the prior sequential quarter 
both of these fluctuations were a result of timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter  as well as related seasonality factors 
days in inventory decreased two days to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter as a result of improved inventory management 
days in inventory remained consistent at days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory increased five days to days due to decreased sales during the quarter resulting from seasonality factors in our consumer sector and delays in customer demand which had been scheduled during future quarters 
days in inventory decreased one day to days during the three months ended november  the decrease in days in inventory was primarily a result of increased sales during the quarter and related seasonality factors 
inventory turns remained consistent at eight turns during all of the fiscal year periods 
days in accounts payable remained consistent at days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter 
days in accounts payable increased two days to days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter  increased one day to days during the three months ended february  from the prior sequential quarter and decreased one day to days during the three months ended november  from the prior sequential quarter 
these fluctuations in days in accounts payables during fiscal year were primarily a result of timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters 
the sales cycle was days during the three months ended august  and was days during the three months ended august  this increase was due to changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows that the asset s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows or at the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform a goodwill impairment test using a two step method on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which the company has determined to be consistent with its operating segments as defined in note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
the recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the reporting unit s carrying 
table of contents amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit  based on projected discounted future results and comparative market multiples 
the use of comparative market multiples the market approach compares our company to other comparable companies based on valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value 
we regularly compare our company and our divisions to our competitors and we believe the judgments used to arrive at these comparable companies are reasonable 
the use of projected discounted future results discounted cash flow approach is based on assumptions that are consistent with our best estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include the identification of reporting units  allocation of related goodwill  the assignment of corporate assets and liabilities to reporting units  future growth rates  discount factors and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities  and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note pension and other postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in either income tax expense or goodwill

sab  we began recognizing stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of earnings on september  the fair value of options granted prior to september  were valued using the black scholes model while the stock appreciation rights granted after this date were valued using a lattice valuation model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option or stock appreciation right  risk free rate  expected dividend yield and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock awards that are expected to vest as a result of satisfaction of time based vesting schedules or the achievement of certain performance conditions

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs  organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model  and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by decreased levels of production with a major customer in the mobility sector and reduced demand in certain other sectors due to a softening market 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of telecommunication products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  a increase in the sale of other products  a increase in aftermarket services  a increase in the sale of networking products  and a increase in the sale of computing and storage products 
specific decreases include a decrease in the sale of mobility products  a decrease in the sale of automotive products  a decrease in the sale of display products  and a decrease in the sale of instrumentation and medical products 
a portion of our net revenue increase is attributable to businesses we acquire 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the automotive and consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas

table of contents foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue over the course of fiscal year due to expansion in asia and eastern europe 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the percentage increase from the prior fiscal year was partially due to factors that decreased gross profit in fiscal year  but have since been resolved 
the factors that contributed to decreased gross profit in fiscal year included inefficiencies in our consumer model which adversely impacted margins  shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that integrated our green point services for another significant customer 
in addition  we have exited production of certain targeted products in the consumer sector 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the slight absolute dollar decrease was due to several factors including a million decrease in legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year related to the independent stock option review that was performed  a million reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense as a result of a change in estimate related to performance based restricted stock awards that are no longer expected to vest  and a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense incurred during fiscal year related to certain personal tax liabilities incurred by certain option holders who have exercised section a affected options as defined under internal revenue code section a 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million as a result of green point being consolidated for a full year in fiscal year  an increase of million related to the nsn acquisition  and an increase of million stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees 
r d 
r d expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is attributed primarily to an increased level of customer funded design projects  along with the repositioning of certain design resources to lower cost regions 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year  offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets 
for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated the restructuring plan 
we have substantially completed restructuring activities and expect to incur the remaining costs over the course of fiscal year with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year for fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million 
for fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million  consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  offset by million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs 

table of contents through august   the restructuring plan has resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million 
these charges include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of  million was paid in fiscal year and million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
these cash costs were offset by million of cash proceeds received in connection with a facility closure 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
at august   liabilities of approximately million related to these restructurings activities are expected to be paid out in fiscal year the remaining liability of million is related to certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefit payments and is expected to be paid out primarily during fiscal years through as of august   as a result of the restructuring activities completed through august  related to the restructuring plan  we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed 
the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately million  and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expense 
these annual costs savings are expected to be offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage  decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to plants located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers  and incremental employee related costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which the production will be shifted 
after considering these cost savings offsets  we currently expect to realize net annualized cost savings of approximately to million by the second half of fiscal year for further discussion of the current restructuring program  see overview summary of results above  and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
other expense 
we recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our north american securitization program totaling million and million for the fiscal years ending august  and  respectively 
the decrease in other expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august  for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitizations to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower interest yields on operating cash  cash deposits and cash equivalents 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher overall average debt levels due to acquisition related debt being outstanding for a full fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the decrease is primarily a result of increased income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to increased sales levels across most industry sectors  as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of other products  an increase in the sale of networking products  a increase in the sale of aftermarket services  a increase in the sale of display products  a increase in the sale of computing and storage products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  and a increase in the sale of automotive products 
specific decreases include a decrease in the sale of telecommunication products and a decrease in the sale of mobility products 
the increased sales levels were due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in these industry sectors  as well as additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions as discussed above

r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year the increase is attributed to growth in our product development activities related to new platform designs  including cell phone modules  wireless and broadband access products  consumer entertainment products  and enterprise storage products 
we also continued efforts in new product technologies and the related production design processes  and the development of new advanced manufacturing technologies 
amortization of intangibles

restructuring and impairment charges 
as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated the restructuring plan 
during fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million  consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  offset by million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs 
the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  primarily related to the repayment of government provided subsidies that resulted from the reduction in force in certain locations 
these restructuring and impairment charges related to the restructuring plan incurred through august  of million include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of and million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
these cash costs were offset by approximately million of cash proceeds received in connection with a facility closure 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 

table of contents additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the final cash payment related to our historical restructuring program 
a liability balance of approximately thousand remained after remittance of the final payment 
this remaining liability was recorded as a reduction of the fiscal year restructuring charge 
other expense 
we recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our north american securitization program totaling million and million for the fiscal years ending august  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august  for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitizations to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower levels of operating cash  cash deposits and cash equivalents due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our debt agreements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility  as well as borrowings under our bridge facility that was entered into on december   primarily to fund the tender offer and merger with green point 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the decrease is primarily a result of the absence of tax expense associated with recording valuation allowances in fiscal year of million on net deferred tax assets as a result of our restructuring plan 
for further discussion of the restructuring plan  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

this consisted primarily of million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million of non cash restructuring charges  million of non cash stock based compensation expense  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and increases in income taxes payable of million 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to the timing of purchases in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of fiscal year the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits being recorded and the timing of certain income tax payments 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million in deferred income taxes  a million increase in inventory  a million increase in accounts receivable  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the increase in inventory was due primarily to the pre positioning of inventory in anticipation of forecasted first quarter demand 
the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to a reduction in the sale of receivables under our north american securitization program in the amount of million 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily relates to the recording of a note receivable due from a customer 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted of net cash of million primarily paid for the acquisition of certain manufacturing operations of nsn and our capital expenditures of million for manufacturing and computer equipment to support our ongoing business across all segments and for expansion activities in asia and eastern europe 
these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of certain excess property  plant and equipment

in addition we paid million of dividends to stockholders during fiscal year see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
we may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
currently  we have approximately million of securities registered with the sec under our shelf registration statement 
the securities act of the act offering reform has significantly modified the registration and offering process under the act 
promptly after filing this annual report on form k  as a result of our existing shelf registration statement expiring december   we anticipate terminating our existing shelf registration statement and filing a new shelf registration statement under these simplified registration procedures 
the new shelf registration statement will register the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into our north american asset backed securitization program with a bank  which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of an amount up to million on the sale of eligible trade accounts receivable of certain domestic operations 
subsequent to fiscal year  several amendments have increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program up to an amount of million and extended the program until march  under this agreement  we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit  administered by an unaffiliated financial institution 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit 
as the receivables sold are collected  we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreements  as amended 
for each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit  we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables  which is calculated based on 
table of contents the terms of the agreement 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
we pay facility fees of per annum of of the average purchase limit and program fees of up to of the average daily outstanding amounts 
the investors and the securitization conduit have no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
as of august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately million

the securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 sfas 
the loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements 
the securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers  consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 
at august   we had million of debt outstanding under the program 
in addition  we incurred interest expense at a variable rate of approximately plus a fixed spread during the fiscal year ended august  on the consolidated statement of earnings 
our north american and foreign asset backed securitization programs expire on march  and april   respectively 
while we have historically been able to renew such asset backed securitization programs on similar terms  market conditions at the time our current programs expire may prevent us from doing so 
in such an event we would be required to seek other forms of borrowing on more acceptable terms  or increase our borrowing under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility  which would decrease our flexibility to make acquisitions and capital expenditures  and also decrease the amount otherwise available for general corporate purposes 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary 
under the terms of the factoring agreement  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable without recourse to the third party purchaser in exchange for cash 
proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a loss on the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of the sale 
the factoring agreement expired in april and was extended for a six month period 
the receivables sold pursuant to this factoring agreement are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
the third party purchaser has no recourse to our assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
at august   we had sold million of trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million 
the resulting loss on the sale of trade accounts receivable sold under this factoring agreement was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively

the securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing under sfas the loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements 
the securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers  consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 
we pay interest at designated commercial paper rates plus a spread 
the securitization program expires on april  at august   we had million of debt outstanding under the program 
in addition  we incurred interest expense at a variable rate of approximately plus a fixed spread during the fiscal year ended august  in our consolidated statement of earnings 
at august   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  available borrowings under our credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
we currently anticipate that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment  expansion of existing manufacturing sites and the completion of new manufacturing sites in eastern europe  asia and the us  the expansion of our corporate headquarters and for information technology infrastructure upgrades 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional 
table of contents proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends  payments for current and future restructuring activities  and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements  future interest on notes payable and long term debt  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and estimated future benefit plan payments as of august  are summarized below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer 
non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations future interest on notes payable and long term debt operating lease obligations estimated future benefit plan payments total contractual cash obligations at august   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions under fin we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our fin liability of million has not been included in the contractual obligations table
