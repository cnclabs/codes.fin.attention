item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the company recorded an increase in operating results for the year ended december  revenues increased by and gross profit margins increased slightly for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenues was principally due to slight increases for both our electronics and power groups 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to increased selling costs and higher corporate expenses 
interest expense decreased and investment and other income increased 
consequently  net income for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
our backlog at december  was approximately  compared to  at december  there is no seasonality to the company s business 
our shipping schedules are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
both of our operating segments are pursuing a significant amount of business opportunities and our confidence level remains very high with respect to receiving many of the orders we are pursuing  although timing is always an uncertainty 
our success of the past few years has significantly strengthened our balance sheet evidenced by our to current ratio at december   which includes the balance sheet accounts of ics 
we currently have a  credit facility in place and the company continues to explore acquisition opportunities that are compatible with our existing operations 
we also have several financing alternatives available to us  if needed  in order to fund any potential acquisitions

such forward looking statements are based on our best estimates of future results  performance or achievements  based on current conditions and the most recent results of the company 
in addition to statements which explicitly describe such risks and uncertainties  readers are urged to consider statements labeled with the terms may  will  potential  opportunity  believes  belief  expects  intends  estimates  anticipates or plans to be uncertain and forward looking 
the forward looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the company s reports and registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations are based on the company s financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
the company s financial statements have been prepared based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  the valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax asset  goodwill impairment and the valuation of share based compensation 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current business conditions and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost specific  average and first in  first out basis or market 
inventory items are reviewed regularly for excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for the company s products can be forecasted based on current backlog  customer options to reorder under existing contracts  the need to retrofit older units and parts needed for general repairs 
although the company makes every effort to insure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have an impact on the level of obsolete material in its inventory and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
however  world events have forced our country into various situations of conflict whereby equipment is used and parts may be needed for repair 
this could lead to increased product demand as well as the use of some older inventory items that the company had previously determined to be obsolete 
deferred tax asset at december   the company had an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  with no limitation on the carry forward period and federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  that expire through approximately   of federal net operating loss carry forwards expire between in addition  the company receives a tax deduction when their employees exercise their non qualified stock options thereby increasing the company s deferred tax asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that a portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company estimates its valuation allowance based on an estimated forecast of its future profitability 
any significant changes in future profitability resulting from variations in future revenues or expenses could affect the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
impairment of goodwill the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in determining the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  assumptions must be made regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for those assets not previously recorded 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  the costs of certain intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
these costs were reviewed for potential impairment in and and will be reviewed on an annual basis thereafter 
share based compensation effective january   the company began recognizing share based compensation under sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards 
total share based compensation expense was  for the year ended december  the estimated fair value of stock options granted in were calculated using the black scholes model 
this model requires the use of input assumptions 
these assumptions include expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  the company currently operates in two industry segments 
its orbit instrument division and its tulip subsidiary are engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic components and subsystems the electronics group 
its behlman subsidiary is engaged in the design and manufacture of commercial power units the power group 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of ics  effective december  ics  which became part of the company s electronics group  performs system integration for gun weapons systems and fire control interface as well as logistics support and documentation 
since the effective date of the acquisition was december   ics was not included in the company s statement of operations for the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the prior year principally due to a and increase in sales recorded from the electronics group and power group  respectively 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  increased to from for the prior year 
this increase resulted from a higher gross profit recorded by the power group that was offset by a slightly lower gross profit recorded by the electronics group 
the increase in gross profit v 
from the power group was principally due to the increase in sales and to product mix 
the slight decrease in gross profit v 
from the electronics group was due principally to product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by to  from  from the year ended december  principally due to higher selling costs brochures and website design incurred by the electronics group and due to higher corporate administrative costs particularly i  of costs related to implementation of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act and ii  retainer paid to its investment banker to pursue strategic alternatives for the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  increased to from principally due to the increase in expenses without a commensurate increase in sales 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in the amounts owed to lenders in the current year and to a reduction in interest rates 
investment and other income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the prior year principally due to an increase in the amounts invested during the current year and despite a write down of  related to certain corporate bonds held by the company  for an unrealized loss that was determined to be other than temporary

income taxes for the year ended december  and december  consist of  and  respectively  in state income taxes that cannot be offset by any state net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of the foregoing  net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the year ended december  increased slightly to  from  for the year ended december  listed below is the ebitda reconciliation to net income year ended december  net income   interest expense   income tax expense   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be construed as an alternative to net income 
an element of the company s growth strategy has been through strategic acquisitions which have been substantially funded through the issuance of debt 
this has resulted in significant interest expense and amortization expense 
ebitda is presented as additional information because the company believes it is useful to our investors and management as a measure of cash generated by our business operations that will be used to service our debt and fund future acquisitions as well as provide an additional element of operating performance 
liquidity  capital resources and inflation our consolidated balance sheet accounts include ics at december  working capital increased to  at december  as compared to  at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  compared to to at december  this reduction was principally due to the term debt used to finance the acquisition of ics 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to net income for the period  the non cash amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation and the increase in accounts payable that was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory and the decrease in customer advances

in june  the company entered into an amended  credit facility with a commercial lender secured by accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
in april  the company entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of tulip and its manufacturing affiliate 
in december  the company entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of ics 
in connection with the new term loan entered into in december  the interest rates on both term loan agreements and the credit facility were amended to equal a certain percentage  depending on a matrix related to a certain financial covenant as defined  plus the one month libor 
at december   the interest rate was equal to the sum of either or plus the one month libor at december  
the credit facility will continue from year to year unless sooner terminated for an event of default including non compliance with certain financial covenants 
principal payments under the two term loan facilities are approximately  per month 
the company had outstanding borrowings of  under its credit facility at december  in april  the company entered into a five year  promissory note with the selling shareholders of tulip at an interest rate of prime plus at december  
principal payments of  were made on a quarterly basis along with accrued interest 
in june  the company refinanced the balance due on the promissory note of  with its primary commercial lender 
under the terms of a new term loan  monthly payments of  will be made over a thirty month period along with accrued interest  depending on a matrix related to a certain financial covenant at december   as defined  plus the one month libor at december  
the company s contractual obligations and commitments are summarized as follows less than after obligation total year years years years long term debt     note payable   employment contracts    operating leases     total contractual obligations     the company s existing capital resources  including its bank credit facilities and its cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to cover the company s cash requirements for its operations 
the company believes that financing alternatives are available in order to fund future acquisitions 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of the company 
certain material trends in april  the company completed the acquisition of tulip and its operations became part of the company s electronics group 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of ics which also became part of the electronics group 
the company s electronics group and the custom division of its power group are heavily dependent on military spending 
the events of september   have put a tremendous emphasis on defense and homeland security spending and the company has benefited from an increasing defense budget 
although the electronics group and the custom division of the power group are pursuing several opportunities for reorders  as well as new contract awards  the company has normally found it difficult to predict the timing of such awards 
in addition  the company has an unprecedented amount of new opportunities that are in the prototype or pre production stage 
these opportunities generally move to a production stage at a later date but the timing of such is also uncertain 
there is no seasonality to the company s business 
the company s revenues are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from its customers 
the company stratifies all the opportunities it is pursuing by various confidence levels 
the company generally realizes a very high success rate with those opportunities to which it applies a high confidence level 
the company currently has a significant amount of potential contract awards to which it has applied a high confidence level 
however  because it is difficult to predict the timing of awards for most of the opportunities the company is pursuing  it is also difficult to predict when the company will commence shipping under these contracts 
a delay in the receipt of any contract from its customer ultimately causes a corresponding delay in shipments under that contract 
during  due to shipping schedules  the company s second half of the year was stronger than the first half 
once again for  based on current and projected shipping schedules  the company expects the second half of to be stronger than the first half 
despite the increase in military spending  the company still faces a challenging environment 
the government is emphasizing the engineering of new and improved weaponry and it continues to be our challenge to work with each of our prime contractors so that we can participate on these new programs 
in addition  these new contracts require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and pre production costs 
while the company attempts to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by its customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun that may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once the company has completed the design and pre production stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
in such event  even if the company is reimbursed its development costs it will not generate any significant profits 
the company is heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
however  even increased military spending does not necessarily guarantee the company increased revenues  particularly  when the allocation of budget dollars may vary depending on what may be needed for specific military conflicts any future reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government due to budget constraints or for any other reason  could have a negative impact on the company s future revenues and earnings 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives the company some diversity and the additions of tulip and ics gives the electronics segment a more diversified customer base 
the company s business strategy is to expand its operations through strategic  accretive acquisitions 
through the past several years  the company reviewed various potential acquisitions and believes there are numerous opportunities presently available 
in april  it completed the acquisition of tulip and in december  it completed the acquisition of ics 
the company has received offers from several financial institutions that have expressed an interest in helping the company with acquisition financing 
however  there can be no assurance it will obtain the necessary financing to complete additional acquisitions and even if it does  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient income from operations of such acquired companies to satisfy the interest payments  in which case  we will be required to pay them out of orbit s operations which may be adversely affected 
the company continues to review acquisition candidates but there is no assurance that an acquisition will be completed in in the first quarter of  the company hired an investment banker to assist the company in its efforts to pursue strategic acquisitions 
during the second quarter of  the company expanded the activities of its investment banker to include the pursuit of alternative strategies  including the potential sale of the company as a means of enhancing shareholder value 
however  there is no assurance that a sale or any of the other strategic alternatives will be accomplished 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had amounts due to its primary lender under three separate term loans totaling approximately  interests on these term loans are equal to the sum of either or plus the one month libor 
in addition  the company has a  line of credit with the same lender at a rate equal to the sum of plus the one month libor 
the company had approximately  in borrowings under the line of credit at december  during  libor averaged approximately and was at december  we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on the actions of the federal reserve that are generally determined by general market and economic fluctuations 
any hypothetical increase of in interest rates will result in an increase of approximately  of annual interest expense exclusive of the impact of any borrowings under the company s line of credit 
none of the company s variable rate of interest arrangements are hedged by any derivative instruments 
the company believes that any moderate interest rate increases will not have any material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
the company believes that it is not subject in any material way to any other forms of market risk
