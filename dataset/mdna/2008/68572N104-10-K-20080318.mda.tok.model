item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 

table of contents executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales were million in  up from million in we generated operating income of million in  up from operating income of million in our earnings per diluted share were per diluted common share in compared with per diluted common share in we generated million in positive operating cash flow in compared with million in each of the preceding two years 
we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last seven years 
what did we focus on in our focus in was on increasing efficiency and productivity of our operating assets and increasing sales of converted product 
as a result  we produced more tons of parent rolls and converted products in than in any previous year 
we benefited from previous years strategies to reduce reliance on open market purchases of parent rolls by installing and starting up our new paper machine 
in addition  in may we began operating all of our older paper machines on a full time basis to take advantage of a tight parent roll market and selling excess parent rolls on the open market at increasing selling prices 
we are confident in our ability to sell converted products  so much of our focus has been on increasing throughput from the converting facility 
mr 
mike sage  our former president and chief executive officer elected to retire july  mr 
robert snyder was appointed president and chief executive officer effective august  in late  we began the process of increasing the depth and talent level of our operating management team to aid in our continued quest to improve the efficiencies of our operating assets 
our second initiative was to continue to profitably grow the business 
we were able to achieve significant growth in our converted product business during in addition  running all of our older machines on a full time basis beginning in may allowed us to take advantage of higher parent roll sales prices 
our goal is to attain a level of converted product business that consumes our total paper making capacity 
what challenges and opportunities did our business face in we experienced significant cost pressures during the year  primarily in the cost of our waste paper 
the price of waste paper increased approximately in over the period 
what will we focus on in in  we will continue to pursue profitable growth of our converted product business by utilizing internally more of our paper making capacity 
we will pursue this strategy through a combination of increased sales to existing customers and sales to new customers in grocery and drug store retail channels 
any paper making capacity that is not consumed by the converting business will be sold as parent rolls in the market 
optimizing the operation of our new paper machine and other assets is another major focus for we expect the changes and additions to the operating management team that began in late to aid in our operations improvement efforts 
continuous improvement of our operations will be critical in helping combat cost pressures 
we intend to improve the efficiency of our converting operations  thereby increasing sales opportunities and lowering production costs 
we intend to further lower our labor costs in our converting facility through the automation of certain processes 
in this project we will purchase and install case packers  conveyors and unitizing equipment at a cost of approximately million 
installation of the equipment is expected to begin in the second quarter of and be finalized and fully operational by the fourth quarter of 
table of contents business overview we are a manufacturer and converter of tissue paper for the private label segment of the value retail consumer tissue market 
we have focused our product design and manufacturing on the discount retail market  primarily the dollar stores  due to their consistent order patterns  limited number of stock keeping units  or skus  offered and the growth being experienced in this channel of the retail market 
all of our revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of recycled waste paper used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting plant  and energy costs 
the private label segment of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
in june  we began operating a new paper machine with a rated annual capacity of approximately  tons 
the capacity of the new machine in addition to the capacity of our older paper machines increased our total production capacity to approximately  tons per year 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  we were able to eliminate the requirement to purchase recycled parent rolls on the open market and commenced the sale of parent rolls on the open market 
prior to the third quarter of  we had purchased parent rolls on the open market since because our own parent roll production had not adequately supplied the requirements of our converting facility 
we purchased approximately   and  tons of paper on the open market in  and  respectively  to supplement our paper making capacity 
beginning in the third quarter of  essentially all of our third party purchases were of virgin pulp fiber required for a premium towel line we produce for one of our customers 
parent rolls are a commodity product and thus are subject to market price and availability 
we experienced significantly higher parent roll prices beginning in early  as well as limited availability  which negatively affected our profitability 
comparative years ended december   and net sales twelve months ended december  in thousands  except price per ton and tons net sales total tons shipped average price per ton net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net sales figures include gross selling price  including freight  less discounts and pricing allowances 
the increase in net sales was attributable primarily to increased volumes of parent rolls sold to third parties and an increase in net sales of converted products  resulting from both higher prices and increased shipment volumes 
for the twelve months ended december   the volume of parent rolls sold to third parties increased by approximately  tons 
the net sales prices per ton for converted product shipments for the twelve months ended december  increased over the same period of while converted product shipments volumes increased in the year over year comparison 

table of contents net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales experienced in was due primarily to higher sales of both converted products and parent rolls 
for the twelve months ended december   net sales of converted products increased approximately as compared to the same period in  the result of higher selling prices and increased shipments 
the increase in net selling prices is primarily due to sales price increases implemented in the first and second quarters of on a per ton basis  selling prices increased in the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in tons of converted product shipped in the period increased approximately compared to the period 
in addition  we shipped approximately  tons of parent rolls to third parties in the period following the mid year start up of our new paper machine and we did not ship any parent rolls in the period

sub total depreciation cost of sales gross profit gross profit margin major components of cost of sales are the cost of internally produced paper  parent rolls purchased from third parties  raw materials  direct labor and benefits  freight on products shipped to customers  insurance  repairs and maintenance  energy  utilities and depreciation 
cost of sales increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to in the period compared with in the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was favorably affected by the higher sales volume and prices discussed above as well as a lower overall cost of paper  excluding depreciation 
partly offsetting these factors was higher depreciation expense and higher converting labor costs 
depreciation for the year ended december  increased  to million  primarily the result of recognizing a full year of depreciation on the million paper machine project started up in june cost of sales increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in the period compared to in the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december   was unfavorably affected by higher converting labor costs  depreciation  an unfavorable sales mix and higher costs of packaging materials  which were partially offset by lower overall paper costs 
the unfavorable mix is the result of an increase in bathroom tissue shipments as compared to towel shipments 
a change in the level of overall business with certain large customers is the primary reason for the mix swing 
depreciation for the year ended december  increased approximately  to million as a result of the start up of the million paper machine project in june the following chart depicts the major factors that influence our paper costs 

table of contents twelve months ended december  paper usage tons converted internal converted purchased total converted third party parent roll sales paper costs per ton cost per ton produced internally cost per ton purchased from third parties total cost per ton consumed total paper costs in thousands cost of internally produced paper cost of paper purchased from third parties total paper costs our overall cost of paper was per ton for the twelve months ended december   compared to per ton in the same period of reduced purchases of parent rolls on the open market  attributable to the successful start up and ramp up of our new paper machine in the second half of  partially offset by higher costs of internally produced paper were the reasons for the decrease in overall cost per ton 
for the year ended december   approximately of the paper consumed in our converting operation was internally produced compared to in the same period in the cost per ton of paper produced internally was in compared to in the same period of higher waste paper costs were partially offset by lower per ton costs of fixed and semi variable costs 
waste paper prices began to increase in the third and fourth quarters of and experienced a more rapid increase during the first and second quarters of waste paper prices were generally level in the last half of overall  the price paid for waste paper increased in the period compared to the same period in our overall cost of paper was per ton in the twelve months ended december   compared to per ton in the year ended december  the reduction in our overall per ton cost of paper is due to an increase in the consumption of internally produced paper in the last half of  following the start up of our new paper machine 
for the year ended december   approximately of the paper consumed in our converting operation was internally produced compared to for the same period in beginning in the third quarter of  parent roll production from our new paper machine eliminated the need to purchase recycled parent rolls from third parties and allowed us to sell approximately  tons of parent rolls during the last four months of for the twelve months ended december   our internal cost of paper production  excluding depreciation  was per ton which was slightly higher than the per ton experienced in the same period of increased waste paper and electrical costs were mostly offset by lower per ton costs of fixed and semi variable costs 
an increase in waste paper costs experienced during the period  primarily in the third and fourth quarters  and lower yields in the first three quarters of the period during the final construction and start up period of our new paper machine resulted in an increase per ton in this component of our paper costs 
gross profit gross profit increased by million to million in the twelve months ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the major reasons for the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is the lower overall cost of paper and higher selling prices for converted products being partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher converting labor costs

costs related to the hiring of our new chief executive officer  other additions to our senior management team  increased costs related to our first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher director fees and expenses were the major reasons for the increase 
nonrecurring selling  general and administrative costs incurred in included the first year stock option expense and recruitment and relocation costs associated with the hiring of our new chief executive officer  as well as recruitment and relocation costs associated with other additions to the senior management team totaling  our costs to complete our first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of increased our fees paid to our external auditors and outside consultants that assisted in the management assessment process by selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased  or  to million  compared to million in the same period in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially flat at of net sales for the year ended december   compared with the same period in an increase in costs directly related to being a public company and higher artwork related expenditures were partially offset by lower costs related to a management services agreement and a lower level of stock option expense 
public company expenses were approximately  in the year ended december   compared with  in the same period in public company expenses were lower in because we were a privately held company until july artwork related expenditures increased approximately  in the period compared to the period due to a higher than normal number of packaging changes by existing customers and packing development with new customer accounts 
costs related to our management services agreement were lower in the twelve months ended december   by  as compared to the same period in due to a  lump sum payment made in which reduced our annual costs under the agreement from  to  the management services agreement was terminated effective march  in the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately  of stock option expense  including  of ongoing expense for options issued to management in april and  for options issued to certain members of the board of directors in february  june and december in the twelve months ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock option expense  including  for options issued to management and  for options issued to certain members of the board of directors in september and december in april  the stock incentive plan was approved by the board of directors and stockholders and options for an aggregate of  shares of common stock were awarded to certain members of management

interest and other expense twelve months ended december  in thousands interest expense other income expense  net interest expense includes interest paid and accrued on all debt and amortization of both deferred debt financing costs and of the discount on our subordinated debt related to warrants issued with the debt 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense for the twelve months ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from the absence of interest capitalization in compared to interest capitalization of  in in connection with the new paper machine 
including the capitalized interest in  total interest costs in the period decreased  or  compared with the same period of lower libor interest rates during and reduced margins over libor following the april refinancing all contributed to the lower interest costs 
partly offsetting these factors was a increase in average bank borrowings in the period reflecting the drawdown of the construction loan during the first half of interest expense for the year ended december   was million  net of  of capitalized interest  compared to interest expense in the period of million  net of  of capitalized interest 
including the capitalized interest  total interest cost  including amortization  increased million  to million in the period compared to million in the period 
gross interest expense increased as a result of borrowings in under our construction loan to fund our new paper machine  higher average borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  and higher interest rates 
during  we borrowed million on the construction loan  the full amount available under the loan agreement 
we capitalized interest under the requirements of sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost in relation to our new paper machine project 
other income was  in the twelve months ended december   compared to  in the same period of the decrease reflects the absence of a  net currency transaction gain recorded in and lower interest income as a result of eliminating the restricted certificate of deposit after the bank debt refinancing in april  which was used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
other income was  in the twelve months ended december   compared to  in the same period of other income in the period was mainly comprised of  in interest income earned from a restricted certificate of deposit with our lending institution and a  foreign currency transaction gain 
other income in the period was mainly comprised of  of income earned from the investment of our unused proceeds from our initial public offering which was partially offset by a net foreign currency exchange loss of  in  we entered into certain purchase agreements related to our new paper machine project 
one of these purchase agreements was denominated in euros 
we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts in the second quarter of to fix the price of this purchase agreement 
we made the final payment under the exchange contract and on the purchase order in the second quarter of the exchange contracts were carried at fair value and any adjustments to fair value affected net income 
in the period  the net proceeds of our initial public offering were used to fund the monthly construction costs of our new paper machine project 
the unused proceeds were invested in short term instruments such as high grade commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit until such time as they were required for construction funding 
as of december   the remaining unused net proceeds totaled  which were consumed in january 
table of contents income before income taxes as a result of the foregoing factors  income before income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  income before income taxes decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit for the year ended december   income tax expense amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the largest contributor to the reduced tax burden was oklahoma investment tax credits oitc associated with our investment in a new paper machine 
the federal indian employment credit iec  which was reinstated in december and extended through year end  contributed to the reduced tax burden 
also benefiting the tax provision was the recognition of tax benefits associated with management and directors stock options not qualifying as incentive stock options under the internal revenue code 
in accordance with sfas r  the company has established a deferred tax asset to account for the future deductibility of the value of these grants upon exercise by the holder 
for the year ended december   the income tax benefit amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of a negative 
the current tax benefit of million primarily resulted from the carryback of net operating losses for tax purposes to tax years and the deferred provision of  was the result of substantial tax depreciation in excess of financial depreciation  partially offset by the recognition of investment  employment and other tax carryforwards for financial reporting purposes 
the law extending the iec also reinstated accelerated depreciation deductions  the most important of which was a four year tax life on investments in machinery and equipment placed in service on former indian lands in oklahoma 
accelerated depreciation will continue to benefit our current tax position for the next few years  as will the oitc  which is earned ratably over five years 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was  resulting from an effective tax rate of 
it is higher than the statutory rate because of non deductible stock option expense being partially offset by the utilization of federal indian employment credits 
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash as well as short term investments 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
our strategy to eliminate the need to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase of a new paper machine was funded through the net proceeds of our initial public offering  additional bank financing and cash flows from operations 
the total cost of the paper machine project was million  exclusive of capitalized interest 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
the shares were registered on form s file number  which the sec declared effective on july  the public offering price of the shares was 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
net proceeds from the offering were million with gross proceeds totaling million and with costs related to offering totaling million as follows underwriting discount of or million charged against additional paid in capital  and direct expenses of  charged against additional paid in capital  including legal fees  printing costs  accounting fees  qualified independent underwriter fees and other miscellaneous direct expenses 

table of contents as of december   all but  of the net proceeds had been used to fund expenditures for our new paper machine project 
the remaining funds were invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
in january  we expended the remaining  on the paper machine project and we began to draw on the construction loan facility at that time 
the company estimates nol carryforwards of million federal and million state which are available to offset future taxable income 
in addition  the company plans to claim million in oklahoma investment tax credit oitc carryforward as of december   which is available to offset future oklahoma income tax liability 
the oitc carryforward is expected to grow over the next three years as it is earned ratably over five years at two percent per year on qualified investments 
we expect to claim  in oitc in each of the next three years related to the new paper machine 
the combination of accelerated depreciation deductions and the oitc will likely eliminate all oklahoma income tax liability for the next few years 
cash was level at  from december  to december  we generated sufficient cash during the first three quarters of to pay off all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
we used a cash build up in the fourth quarter and borrowings under our revolving credit line to retire all of our outstanding subordinated debentures in december totaling million 
cash decreased by  during to  at december  the decrease was attributable to the application of remaining funds from the public offering to the paper machine project 
cash decreased by  during to  at december  in addition to the cash balances  we maintained million of short term investments in certificates of deposit at december  and the million was restricted under the provisions of our term loan agreement until april   the term date of our existing credit agreement during those periods 
the million was applied to our revolving credit when the bank debt was refinanced in april the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december   and twelve months ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities increased by million  to million  more than three times the amount reported for stronger earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  deferred taxes and stock option expense was the primary reason for the increase 
the realization of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and also contributed to the increased cash flow 
an increase in the level of business activity resulted in higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
cash flow used in investing activities was for capital expenditures  mainly of maintenance projects 
offsetting these outflows was the release of the million restricted certificate of deposit in connection with the april refinancing of our bank debt 
annual maintenance capital expenditures are estimated to be million per year over the next several years which we expect to fund from operating cash flow 
in order to improve our operating costs  we plan to purchase equipment during to automate certain portions of our converting facility at a cost of approximately million 
expenditures for this project will begin in the first quarter of and continue through the fourth quarter 
following the completion of the project in the fourth quarter of  we expect annualized net cash savings to approximate million 
in either or  per the terms of our wastewater pretreatment agreement with the oowa  we are required to expand our wastewater pre treatment facility at an estimated cost of million 
funding for the converting automation equipment is expected to come from a combination of borrowings under our revolving loan facility and operating cash flow  while funding for the pretreatment expansion is contemplated in the current debt facility in an amount up to million 

table of contents cash flows used in financing activities was million  primarily attributable to a million reduction in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans and the retirement of all of our subordinated debentures at a cost of million 
our april refinancing of our credit facility resulted in a net increase in borrowings of  cash provided by operations totaled million in the year ended december   essentially level with the same period in an increase in income taxes receivable in was mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation on the new paper machine 
the recently extended tax benefits for property placed in service on former indian lands added to the net operating loss for tax purposes 
this increase was largely offset by the absence of the inventory increase incurred during the absence was due to a scarcity of third party parent rolls available on the open market at year end accounts receivable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher sales volumes 
accounts payable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher levels of purchasing 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december   was million  mostly related to the new paper machine project 
capital expenditures for the new machine amounted to million in  inclusive of capitalized interest of  the start up date for the project was june  cash provided from financing activities amounted to million in the year ended december   mainly attributable to borrowings under a construction loan agreement with established bank creditors 
cash provided from financing activities decreased from million in the year ended december  due to the absence of the proceeds from the initial public offering and reduced borrowings under the revolving credit line 
principal payments on the bank debt remained level at million in each period 
on april   we re financed our existing credit facility with the existing bank group 
on march   we amended the facility to increase the revolving credit facility and capital expenditures limits for following the amendment  the credit facility consists of the following a million revolving credit facility with a year term  outstanding at december   including  of bank overdrafts  a million term loan a with a ten year term  no principal repayments for the first months and then will be amortized as if it had an year life million outstanding at december   a million term loan b with a four year term and is being amortized as if it had a six year life million outstanding at december   and a million capital expenditures facility with a four year term that will be amortized as if it had a five year life outstanding at december  
under the terms of the agreement  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin and amounts outstanding under term loan b and the capital expenditures facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin  which is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income taxes paid 
amounts outstanding under term loan a will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
for the revolving credit facility  the margin ranges from a negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and to basis points for libor based loans 
for term loan b  the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
for the capital expenditures facility  the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a specific funded debt to ebitda ratio  debt service coverage ratio and an annual limit on un financed capital expenditures 
in connection with the re financing  the million restricted certificate of deposit was released and applied to the revolving credit facility 
the amount available under the revolving credit line may be reduced in the event that our borrowing base  which is based upon our qualified receivables and qualified inventory  is less than million 
obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  a covenant prohibiting us from declaring or paying dividends 
the financial covenants in the agreement require us to maintain specific ratios of funded debt to ebitda and debt 
table of contents service coverage which are tested as of the end of each quarter and places a limit on the amount of annual non financed capital expenditures 
the maximum allowable funded debt to ebitda ratio is to and the minimum allowable debt service coverage ratio is to following the march amendment  our annual expenditures for non financed capital equipment are limited to million for the fiscal year and million per fiscal year thereafter 
the increased capital expenditures limit in will be used to complete the previously discussed automation project in our converting facility 
the capital expenditures facility is intended to fund an expansion of our wastewater pre treatment 
a new water discharge permit was issued effective august  which requires us to expand our existing pre treatment facility to reduce biological oxygen demand and total suspended solids from our effluent stream 
under the new permit  we are required to complete the expansion and make operational our pre treatment facility by august  the project is in the pre engineering phase and is expected to cost approximately million 
if an event of default occurs  the agent may declare the banks obligation to make loans terminated and all outstanding indebtedness  and all other amounts payable under the credit agreement  due and payable 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were limited to our long term debt 
we do not have any leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans nor do we have any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 
maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after thousands long term debt interest payments total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
these amounts assume interest payments at the year end borrowing amount and rate for our revolving credit facility 
the amount borrowed in future years is dependent on our free cash flow from time to time 
interest payments on the term loans have been calculated based on the interest rate in effect as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s 
table of contents creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off  net of recoveries  in the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
during the years ended december  and  we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we decreased the inventory valuation reserve by  new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues new accounting standards in a continuing effort to improve standards of financial accounting and reporting 
we have reviewed the recently issued pronouncements and concluded that the following new accounting standards are applicable to us 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements which amends and puts in one place guidance on the use of fair value measurements which had been spread through four apb opinions and fasb standards 
no extensions of the use of fair value measurements are contained in this new pronouncement and  with some special industry exceptions eg  broker dealers  no significant changes in practice should ensue 
the standard is to be applied to financial statements beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

this standard permits the use of fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet with the net change in fair value recognized in periodic net income 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations because the majority of its debts and investment assets are variable rate and thus fair value approximates recorded value 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
business combinations to clarify certain issues regarding business combinations 
the major impact on orchids could be the requirement to write off certain costs of completing an acquisition as incurred 
the standard is effective for periods beginning after december  also in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
at present this standard is inapplicable to orchids as we have no subsidiaries 
the standard is effective for minority interest accounting for periods beginning after december  non gaap discussion in addition to our gaap results  we also consider non gaap measures of our performance for a number of purposes 
we use ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity 
ebitda represents net income before net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 

table of contents we believe ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  it does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the years ended december   and  twelve months ended december  in thousands  except of net sales net income plus interest expense  net plus income tax benefit expense plus depreciation ebitda of net sales ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in ebitda as a percent of net sales increased from in to in the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change 
ebitda decreased  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
our revolving line of credit and our term loans carry a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate borrowings of million  excluding bank overdrafts  which are classified with bank debt in the balance sheet  but which bear no interest 
outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loans bear interest at the prime rate or libor  plus a margin based upon the debt service coverage ratio 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it would be reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
based on the current borrowing  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a pre tax  increase to our annual interest expense
