item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of national health investors  inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
other important factors are identified in item business above 
executive overview national health investors  inc nhi or the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that invests primarily in income producing health care properties with emphasis on the long term health care sector 
as of december   we had interests in real estate owned and investments in mortgages  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of  founded in  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide  primarily in the long term health care industry 
portfolio as of december   we had investments in real estate and mortgage notes receivable in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  acute care hospital  medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately  aggregate carrying value amount of loans to borrowers and  of real estate investments with lessees 
of these facilities  are leased to national healthcare corporation nhc  a publicly held company and our largest customer 
during  our rental income totaled  of which  or was from facilities leased by nhc 
these facilities include centers subleased to and operated by other companies  the lease payments of which are guaranteed to us by nhc 
nhc was our investment advisor until november  consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have increased our portfolio so that the portion of our real estate portfolio leased by nhc has been reduced from of our total portfolio on october  the date we began operations to of our total real estate portfolio on december   based on the net book value carrying amount of these properties 
in  these assets were transferred by nhc to us at their then current net book value in a non taxable exchange 
many of these assets were substantially depreciated as a result of having been carried on nhc s books for as many as years 
as a result  we believe that the fair market value of these assets is significantly in excess of their net book value 
to illustrate  rental income in from nhc was  or approximately of our net book value of the facilities leased to nhc 
subsequent additions to the portfolio r elated to non nhc investments reflect their higher value based on existing costs at the date the investment was made 
as with all assets in our portfolio  we monitor the financial and operating results of each of these properties on a quarterly basis 
in addition to reviewing the consolidated financial results of nhc  the individual center financial results are reviewed including their occupancy  patient mix  state survey results and other relevant information 
at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by publicly held company operators  by regional operators  and by small operators

we continue to cautiously evaluate new portfolio investments and monitor the current prices being offered for health care assets 
however  even as we make new investments  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt vs 
equity compared to our historical levels 
new investments may be funded by our liquid investments and  if needed  by external financing 
we will make new investments where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate returns to our investors 
we have focused over the last years on increasing our liquidity and lowering our debt 
our debt to capitalization ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity is also strong with cash and marketable securities of  at december  our total debt outstanding was  at december  on july   we paid in full our million unsecured public notes from available cash investments 
on december   we reached an agreement with nhc to extend through december   their current lease on of our real estate properties 
these facilities include centers leased to other parties and retirement centers 
this extension assures an ongoing relationship with our largest customer 
disposition of assets we owned and operated long term health care facilities the foreclosure properties that we acquired through foreclosure or through the acceptance of deeds in lieu of foreclosure and subsequently sold the facilities in and to unrelated not for profit entities  providing financing 
while the original sales were recognized for tax purposes under the installment sale method  the operating revenues and expenses of these facilities continued to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income until such time as the down payment and continuing investment criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas were met  at which time we would account for the sales under the full accrual method 
no installment payments had been made by the borrowers 
on december   the criteria for recording the sales wer e met 
net assets having a book value of  were deconsolidated  mortgage notes receivable of  were recorded  and a net gain on the sale and deconsolidation of these assets was recognized of  on december   we received irrevocable bank letters of credit aggregating  from the borrowers to guarantee down payments on the original notes and commitments to make monthly principal and interest payments to us to amortize the remaining note balances 
critical accounting policies we prepare our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry and derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  the long term health care industry has at times experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers 
in and prior  we had determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as the result of these events 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
on a quarterly basis  we review our notes receivable for realizability when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable o r  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas as amended by eitf the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an impairment of a marketable security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
on december   we were notified by bank of america that its largest  privately placed  enhanced cash fund called columbia strategic cash fund the fund would be closed and liquidated 
in addition  cash redemptions were temporarily suspended  although redemptions could be filled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities consisting principally of high quality corporate debt  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the fund s valuation would be based on the market value of the underlying securities  whereas historically the fund s valuation was based on amortized cost  and interest would continue to accrue 
the carrying value of our investment in the fund on december  was  subsequent to december   and prior to december   we received a pro rata distribution of underlying securities in the fund as described abo ve of  and cash redemptions of principal totaling  realized losses on the distribution and redemption of securities and cash amounted to  at december   the fair market value of our investment in the fund was estimated to be  and the fair market value of our investment in the separate ima was estimated to be  for a total of  unrealized losses measured as the difference between fair market value and our original investment  at cost  amounted to we are in regular communication with the manager of the fund and the ima in order to monitor the net asset value and the expected cash redemption dates based upon the manager s liquidation strategy 
we have been advised by the fund manager that the goal is to make an orderly liquidation of the fund and ima with the goal of preserving our original investment 
cash redemptions are estimated by the fund manager to occur periodically over the next two years 
interest continues to accrue and is paid to us each month into our regular bank account 
there may be further declines in the value of our investments in the fund and the ima 
to the extent that we determine there is a further decline in the fair market value based on up to date information provided to us by the fund manager  we may recognize additional losses in future periods 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers  for whom we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not probable of collection until received 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis as required unde r statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for leases sfas to the extent that future lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals and are excluded from minimum lease payments in accordance with sfas reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts  proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on notes receivable 
our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions  debt service payments including principal and interest  real property acquisitions and general and administrative expenses 
these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below

we have a low level of debt at  and it is serviced through our normal operations 
due to the payoff of our million in unsecured public notes in  our debt to book capitalization ratio has declined to  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity in cash accounts and other readily marketable securities traded on public exchanges continues to increase from our normal operating cash flows from core business investments in leases and mortgage notes as shown in our consolidated financial statements

we currently have sufficient liquidity to finance current investments for which we are committed as well as to repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity 
real estate  mortgage and notes receivable write downs recoveries our borrowers and tenants have experienced financial pressures and difficulties similar to those experienced by the health care industry in general since governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or for certain periods failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us 
the following table summarizes our write downs and recoveries for the last three years  recorded in accordance with the provisions of sfas and sfas write downs recoveries in thousands real estate mortgages notes receivable net during  two mortgage notes receivable were paid off  resulting in recoveries of amounts previously written down of  in addition  a recovery from a previous write down of our investment in a mortgage investment pool amounted to  the early payoff of the hsm of texas loan resulted in  of recoveries of amounts previously written down in   and due to significant non payment issues with the original borrower 
the original borrower and personal guarantor filed bankruptcy  then the facilities were sold to hsm of texas

see note to our financial statements for details of the properties identified as impaired real estate investments and non performing loans 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and notes receivable are realizable including those identified as impaired or non performing and supported by the value of the underlying collateral

year ended december  compared to year ended december  in accordance with sfas  the results of operations for facilities sold  including the gain or loss on such sales  have been reported in the current and prior periods as discontinued operations

in addition  a gain of  on the sale as a result of merger of alc common stock for cash described as  of security recoveries and  of realized gains is included in non operating income in discontinued operations in february  a facility in dallas  texas  was sold for cash proceeds of  and a loss of  was recognized 
in january  a facility in charlotte was sold for cash proceeds of  and a gain was recognized of  funds from operations our funds from operations ffo on a diluted basis is  for the year ended december   versus  in  an increase of 
the increase in ffo was primarily due to an increase of  in loan and realty recoveries of amounts previously written down 
ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
diluted ffo assumes  if dilutive  the conversion of convertible subordinated debentures  the conversion of cumulative convertible preferred stock and the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentation of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative  and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our p erformance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use our definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our ffo to that of other reits 
funds from operations in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states  as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that recurring impairments on real property are not an appropriate adjustment 
the net gain on sale of real estate and the deconsolidation of the foreclosure property previously consolidated due to the requirements of sfas is not an element of ffo in the following table reconciles net income to funds from operations year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts net income dividends to preferred stockholders net income available to common stockholders elimination of non cash items in net income real estate depreciation real estate depreciation in discontinued operations gain on partial land sale continuing operations gain on dispositions and deconsolidation discontinued operations basic funds from operations available to common stockholders interest on convertible subordinated debentures diluted funds from operations available to common stockholders basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share shares for basic funds from operations per share shares for diluted funds from operations per share impact of inflation during the past three years  inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of relatively moderate inflation rates 
inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing its operations 
our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments with fixed rates of return 
these investments are financed through a combination of equity  long term borrowings  and  as needed  line of credit arrangements 
during periods of rising interest rates  our ability to grow may be adversely affected because yields on new investments may increase more slowly than new borrowing costs 
certain of our leases offer some degree of inflation protection by requiring increases in rental income based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants 
impact of new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
most of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another real estate investment trust and yields dividends at a fixed rate of 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investments in notes receivable and preferred stock are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would reduce our future earnings and cash flows related to these debt instruments by  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would increase our future earnings and cash flows related to these debt instruments by  we are subject to risks associated with debt financing  including the risk that our existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
certain of our loan agreements require the maintenance of specified financial ratios 
accordingly  in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of those limitations  our ability to make additional investments may be limited 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks
