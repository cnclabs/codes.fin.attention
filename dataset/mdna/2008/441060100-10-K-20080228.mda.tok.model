item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hospira is a global specialty pharmaceutical and medication delivery company that develops  manufactures and markets products that help improve the safety  cost and productivity of patient care 
hospira s portfolio includes one of the industry s broadest lines of generic acute care and oncology injectables  which help address the high cost of proprietary pharmaceuticals  and integrated solutions for medication management and infusion therapy 
hospira s broad portfolio of products is used by hospitals and alternate site providers  such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities 
in february  hospira acquired mayne pharma to increase its global presence in specialty generic injectable pharmaceuticals 
transition from abbott hospira became a separate public company pursuant to a spin off from abbott on april  the spin off date 
in connection with the spin off  hospira and abbott agreed that the legal transfer of certain operations and assets net of liabilities outside the united states would occur  and be completed  within two years after the spin off 
during the transition period  these operations and assets were used in the conduct of hospira s international business and hospira was subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by such operations and assets 
hospira was dependent on abbott s international infrastructure until such legal transfers occurred in each international country 
these transfers were completed in hospira and abbott entered into various manufacture and supply agreements prior to the spin off under which hospira supplies certain products to abbott that it manufactured prior to the spin off 
these agreements had an initial two year term originally scheduled to expire in april  subject to being extended by abbott for an additional two year term under substantially similar contractual provisions 
some of these agreements terminated in  resulting in lower sales to abbott during and cost reduction activities as part of its strategy to improve margins and cash flows  beginning in  hospira has taken a number of actions to reduce operating costs and optimize its manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
in may  to reduce its costs to produce critical care products  hospira completed a strategic manufacturing  commercialization and development agreement with icu medical and sold its salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility and related equipment and inventory to icu medical 
in connection with these transactions  during  hospira recorded an impairment charge of million and a loss of million  which was hospira s best estimate of the cost of certain obligations that hospira was required to reimburse to icu medical over the month period after closing 
both the impairment and the loss related to obligations assumed were recorded in cost of products sold 
during and  hospira reduced its liability by million and million  respectively  due to a change in icu medical s strategy for the manufacturing facility that reduced hospira s related obligation 
in august  hospira announced plans to close its manufacturing plant in donegal  ireland and closed the facility late in products produced at the donegal plant have been moved to hospira facilities primarily in costa rica and the dominican republic 
at the time of the announcement  hospira expected to incur million to million of pre tax charges relating to the plant closure 
during  and  hospira incurred million  million and million of these charges  respectively  which are reported in cost of products sold 
the costs consist primarily of severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the building and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
for further details regarding the financial impact of this plant closure  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in february  hospira announced plans to close manufacturing plants in ashland  ohio and montreal  canada over the subsequent to months  respectively  and also provided a timeline for phasing out production at a facility in abbott s north chicago  illinois campus  where it has leased space from its former parent company since the spin off in april hospira intends to transition out of this facility in advance of the lease s expiration in  with a majority of the product transfers occurring over the four years following the announcement 
hospira will transfer production of the primary products from these facilities to other hospira facilities and will outsource certain product components to third party suppliers 
as of december   the ashland  ohio manufacturing plant was closed and hospira expects to close the montreal  canada manufacturing plant by the end of the first half of the aggregate charges that hospira will incur related to the plant closings are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million on a pre tax basis  of which approximately million to million are expected to be reported as restructuring charges 
the restructuring costs consist primarily of costs related to severance and other employee benefit costs  additional depreciation resulting from the decreased useful lives of the buildings and certain equipment  and other exit costs 
the remaining charges relate to the relocation of production 
during and  hospira incurred million and million of restructuring charges  respectively  which are recorded in cost of products sold 
for further details regarding the financial impact of these plant closures  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these cost reduction activities involve risks and uncertainties as relocating or outsourcing production is a complex process 
hospira may incur more charges than estimated and may not realize the expected cost savings on its planned time frame or at all 
see item a 
risk factors risks relating to hospira s business and industry hospira s cost reduction activities have resulted in significant charges 
these activities may disrupt hospira s business and may not result in the intended cost savings 
acquisition of mayne pharma on february   hospira completed its acquisition of mayne pharma for  million 
as mayne pharma has strong market positions in europe and australia and a significant commercial infrastructure outside the united states  the acquisition has substantially increased hospira s international presence 
the acquisition has also broadened hospira s specialty injectable pharmaceuticals product line 
the results of operations of mayne pharma are included in hospira s results for periods on and after february   which has affected comparability of the financial statements for the periods presented in this report and will affect comparability in future periods 
for  sales of mayne pharma products  which are principally specialty injectable pharmaceutical products  are reported as a separate product line within each of hospira s reportable segments 
in connection with the acquisition  hospira recorded million of charges relating to purchase accounting during  including million of acquired in process research and development  all of which was recorded in the first quarter  and million of inventory step up charges  of which million was expensed in the first quarter and million was expensed in the second quarter 
hospira also recorded million of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition  which will be amortized over their useful lives which have a weighted average life of years 
for further details regarding these charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item in connection with the integration of mayne pharma into its operations  hospira expects to incur approximately million to million of cash expenditures for the two year period after the closing  of which million to million will be recorded as expense and the remainder relates to purchase accounting items and capital projects 
these expenses relate to the closure of facilities  termination of lease agreements and employee related benefit arrangements during the two year period after the closing 
approximately million of cash expenditures and million of such expenses were recorded during in addition to integration expenses  hospira recorded other acquisition related expenses of million in for further details regarding these expenses  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the total purchase price of  million is comprised of  million of cash purchase price and million of direct acquisition costs 
on february   hospira incurred  million of bank debt to finance the mayne pharma acquisition 
the remainder of the purchase price was funded with cash on hand 
the bank facilities included a million  three year term loan facility and a  million one year bridge loan facility 
the bridge loan facility was completely refinanced on march  through the issuance of long term debt securities 
for further details  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item on an ongoing basis  hospira will continue to incur significantly greater interest expense than it incurred in prior periods  and will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to servicing its debt 
please refer to liquidity and capital resources debt and capital later in this item for further details 
the acquisition of mayne pharma is subject to various risks and uncertainties  including risks relating to the integration of mayne pharma and risks relating to our incurring substantial indebtedness in connection with the acquisition 
please see item a 
risk factors risks relating to the mayne pharma acquisition and related transactions 
other factors manufacturing and quality 
hospira s ability to manufacture and sell high quality  low cost products in compliance with regulatory requirements is an important factor to the success of its business 
hospira must comply with regulations governing the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of its products  including requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  and must incur expense  time and effort to ensure compliance with the complex regulations 
hospira must also maintain continuity of supply of raw materials that comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
its business is subject to risks of manufacturing and supply interruptions  and product quality issues  which can lead to product recalls or field actions 
hospira did not experience significant manufacturing or raw material supply interruptions during the periods presented in this report 
hospira has recalled  and or conducted field alerts relating to  certain of its products from time to time 
while these activities can lead to costs to repair or replace affected products and temporary interruptions in product sales  and can impact reported results of operations in the applicable period  hospira does not believe that these activities had a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations during the periods presented in this report 
product development 
hospira views investment in research and development as an important driver of sales growth over the longer term 
to successfully execute its product development strategy  hospira must continue to develop cost competitive products and enhancements that satisfy customer needs  introduce products on a timely basis and successfully market those products 
as a part of this strategy  hospira will also need to identify  and successfully manage  strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements 
hospira believes that the ability to grow sales in the specialty injectable pharmaceutical product line will be driven primarily by its ability to launch new generic drug products on a timely basis 
generally  the price and sales volume of a generic drug tend to decline as more competitors enter the market for that particular drug 
however  new product launches can offset declines from other portfolio products and generate growth 
if a company can be first to market  such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time  higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved 
timely  efficient research and development capabilities and expertise in legal and regulatory matters will be required to be successful in executing a first to market strategy 
over the longer term  hospira views biosimilar products as an important opportunity 
in  hospira invested in biosimilar product development through its collaboration with stada  under which it made a million upfront payment  and its million acquisition of bresagen limited 
a key component to the product development strategy for medication management systems has been the development and offering of newer technology drug delivery pumps and related products and services 
hospira expects to achieve sales growth in part due to increased sales of these newer technology products 
hospira believes that the features and functionality offered by these products position it to achieve such growth over the long term 
as a result  hospira is aggressively competing to upgrade its current customer base as well as to capture competitive business 
because of changes in technology  it may take more time and effort to sell and implement newer technology products to its customers 
hospira also expects intense competition for existing and potential customers from other competitors 
the timing and amount of purchases made by customers cannot be predicted with certainty 
hospira s ability to execute on its product development efforts is subject to various risks and uncertainties described in item a 
risk factors  including the ability to timely launch new products and enhancements  the ability to successfully manage collaborative arrangements  actions of competitors and acceptance by customers 
gpo contracts 
the ability to maintain gpo contracts is an important factor for hospira to generate sales 
approximately of hospira s net sales are made through these contracts 
typically  these contracts cover a portion of hospira s product lines  specify the prices for hospira s products  and are effective for three to five years 
generally  the contracts are extended or competitively bid prior to contract expiration 
in any year  a portion of the various contracts hospira has with gpo s expire 
while hospira expects to maintain its business with the gpo s and has been able to maintain its base business under its gpo contracts during the periods covered by this report  if hospira is unable to renew or renegotiate any significant gpo contracts in the future  its ability to sell products and its profitability may be harmed 
share repurchase 
in february  hospira s board of directors approved a million share repurchase program 
as of december   hospira purchased  shares for million in aggregate under the board authorization  all of which were purchased during since hospira intends to dedicate a substantial portion of its future cash to servicing debt and integrating mayne pharma into its operations  hospira does not expect to repurchase any shares in critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered to customers and title passes 
in certain circumstances  hospira enters into arrangements in which it provides multiple elements to its customers 
in these cases  total revenue is divided among the separate units of accounting deliverables based on their relative fair value and is recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the recognition of revenue is delayed if there are significant post delivery obligations  such as installation or customer acceptance 
for drug delivery pumps  revenue is typically derived under one of three types of arrangements outright sales of the drug delivery pump  placements under lease arrangements  and placements under contracts that include associated disposable set purchases 
lease agreements under which hospira s warranty obligation extends through the entire term are accounted for as operating leases 
for these  hospira recognizes revenue over the lease term  which averages five years 
for leases under which hospira s warranty obligation is limited to approximately one year  hospira accounts for these as sales type leases  under which the discounted sales value of the drug delivery pump is recorded as revenue upon placement with the customer 
hospira has contractual arrangements with certain customers whereby it places drug delivery pumps at customer sites  and the customers agree to purchase minimum levels of disposable products sets that are used with the pumps 
these arrangements generally do not include any upfront fees or payments 
the contractual arrangements generally set forth fixed prices for the purchases of the disposable products  where the prices for the disposables do not change over the term of the arrangement  other than  in some cases  for changes in consumer price index provisions 
title for the pumps is retained by hospira throughout these arrangements  and the related asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
in these placement arrangements  revenue is recognized as the disposable products are delivered  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
hospira markets a server based suite of software applications designed to connect data from a hospital s drug information library to drug delivery pumps throughout the hospital 
the arrangements related to such applications typically include a perpetual software license  software maintenance and implementation services 
hospira recognizes revenue related to these arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue and implementation service revenue are generally recognized upon completion of related obligations or customer acceptance and software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  hospira records an estimate for certain items that reduce gross sales in arriving at its reported net sales for each period 
these items include chargebacks  rebates and other items such as cash discounts and returns 
provisions for chargebacks and rebates represent the most significant and complex of these estimates 
chargebacks hospira sells a significant portion of its specialty injectable pharmaceutical products through wholesalers  which maintain inventories of hospira products and later sell those products to end customers 
in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  hospira negotiates prices with end customers for certain products under pricing agreements including  for example  group purchasing organization contracts 
consistent with industry practice  the negotiated end customer prices are typically lower than the prices charged to the wholesalers 
when an end customer purchases a hospira product that is covered by a pricing agreement from a wholesaler  the end customer pays the wholesaler the price determined under the pricing agreement 
the wholesaler is then entitled to charge hospira back for the difference between the price the wholesaler paid hospira and the contract price paid by the end customer a chargeback 
this process is necessary to enable hospira to track actual sales to the end customer  which is essential information to run the business effectively 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
to account for the chargeback  hospira records the initial sale to a wholesaler at the price invoiced to the wholesaler and at the same time  records a provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will later charge back to hospira  reducing gross sales and trade receivables 
this provision must be estimated because the actual end customer and applicable pricing terms may vary at the time of the sale to the wholesaler 
accordingly  the most significant estimates inherent in the initial chargeback provision relate to the volume of sales to the wholesalers that will be subject to chargeback and the ultimate end customer contract price 
these estimates are based primarily on an analysis of hospira s product sales and most recent historical average chargeback credits by product  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  current contract pricing  anticipated future contract pricing changes and claims processing lag time 
hospira estimates the levels of inventory at the wholesalers through analysis of wholesaler purchases and inventory data obtained directly from certain of the wholesalers 
a one percent decrease in end customer contract prices for sales in the us pending chargeback at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by million 
a one percent increase in wholesale units sold in the us subject to chargebacks at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by million 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from estimates 
at december  and  chargebacks of million and million  respectively  were recorded as a reduction in trade receivables 
includes the addition of mayne pharma 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for chargebacks was consistent across all periods presented 
rebates hospira primarily offers rebates to direct customers  customers who purchase from certain wholesalers at end customer contract prices and government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a contracted discount applied to the direct customer s purchases 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased hospira products from a wholesaler under a pricing agreement with hospira 
governmental agency rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers such as medicaid  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability and a reduction of gross sales at the same time the product sale is recorded 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to months after sale 
in determining provisions for rebates to direct customers  hospira considers the volume of eligible purchases by these customers and the rebate terms 
in determining rebates on sales through wholesalers  hospira considers the volume of eligible contract purchases  the rebate terms and the estimated level of inventory at the wholesalers that would be subject to a rebate  which is estimated as described above under chargebacks 
upon receipt of a chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information  hospira can then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement 
rebates under governmental programs are based on the estimated volume of products sold subject to these programs 
each period the estimates are reviewed and revised  if necessary  in conjunction with a review of contract volumes within the period 
adjustments related to prior period sales have not been material in any period 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities 
includes the addition of mayne pharma 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for rebates was consistent across all periods presented 
the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for and in each year  the provisions for chargebacks and rebates relating to prior period sales were not material 
dollars in thousands chargebacks rebates balance at january    provisions   payments   balance at december    provisions   payments   balance at december    stock based compensation on january   hospira adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r which requires  among other changes  that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized as compensation cost over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant 
under sfas no 
r  hospira uses the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility and expected life of the awards 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if hospira uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
pension and post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its active and retired employees based both in and outside of the united states 
prior to the spin off date  hospira employees participated in abbott benefit plans that provided pension and post retirement benefits 
for financial reporting purposes  hospira develops assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and reviews public market data and general economic information 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  pension and post retirement benefit expense  could have been materially impacted 
the us discount rate estimate for and were developed with the assistance of yield curves developed by third party actuaries  while prior year estimates used moody s aa corporate bond index  with consideration of differences in duration between the bonds in the index and hospira s benefit liabilities 
for non us plans  benchmark yield data for high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments were used to derive discount rate assumptions 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts  and economic and capital market conditions 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for was for pre and for post years of age employees  with both rates declining to by and  respectively 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate  with other assumptions held constant  would increase decrease the service and interest component of net post retirement medical and dental cost for the year ended december  by approximately million  and would increase decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

one provision of sfas no 
requires full recognition of the funded status of hospira s defined benefit and post retirement plans 
the incremental effect of the application of this provision in is provided in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item another provision of sfas no 
requires the measurement of hospira s defined benefit plan s assets and its obligations to determine the funded status be made as of the end of the fiscal year 
this provision of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  hospira does not anticipate that the impact from the adoption of this provision of sfas no 
will be significant to its financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is generally determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
determining the extent of an impairment  if any  typically requires various estimates and assumptions using management s judgment  including cash flows directly attributable to the asset  the useful life of the asset and residual value  if any 
when necessary  hospira uses internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in addition  the remaining useful life of the impaired asset is revised  if necessary 
loss contingencies hospira accounts for contingent losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  if hospira is initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
income taxes hospira s provision for income taxes is based on taxable income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
such liabilities are based on management s judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors  and represent the best estimate as to the likely outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its associated liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to fund foreign acquisitions or to meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs 
see further discussion regarding the impact on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item hospira has been providing for income taxes based on its independent activities after the separation from abbott 
these estimates might change in future periods as hospira develops its own tax filing history and considers the results of tax authority examinations

the increase was also driven by contributions from new product launches in and  including ampicillin sulbactam  ondansetron and propofol 
net sales in medication delivery systems increased  driven by growth in both infusion therapy and medication management systems sales 
growth in infusion therapy products sales was largely due to increased volume from new and existing customer contracts 
medication management systems sales increased due to higher placements of devices and increased revenue from related services 
net sales in injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing decreased due to expected lower demand from existing customers for certain products  including several products that now have generic competition 
the decrease in us net sales to abbott was primarily due to expected decreased volume to abbott for several of its products  partially offset by increased price 
the other product line includes sales of hospira s products to alternate site providers such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities  as well as sales of critical care devices and brain function monitoring systems 
the growth in sales to alternate site healthcare customers was more than offset by a decline in sales of critical care devices  the planned exit of certain products manufactured in ashland  ohio  and other adjustments 
sales to alternate site healthcare customers increased due to higher overall sales of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and medication delivery systems  partially offset by decreased sales of deferoxamine 
international net sales to third parties were higher in all regions primarily related to increased sales of specialty injectable pharmaceuticals and medication management systems  favorable exchange  and increased contract manufacturing sales

these factors were partially offset by lower sales of add vantage diluents due to competitive drug supply issues 
the net sales increase in medication delivery systems was driven primarily by growth in medication management systems

the other product line includes sales of hospira s products to alternate site providers such as clinics  home healthcare providers and long term care facilities  as well as sales of critical care devices and brain function monitoring systems 
the increase in other us sales was primarily due to increased sales to alternate site healthcare customers including higher sales of anesthesia products  including recently introduced propofol  increased sales of pumps and sets  and other adjustments  partially offset by decreased sales of deferoxamine due to a competitive product launch and lower critical care sales 
international net sales to third parties were up  primarily reflecting increased sales on a third party manufacturing contract  growth in canada  and favorable exchange  partially offset by reduced volumes due to transition related supply chain disruptions and lower pricing to distributors compared to the prior abbott direct sales model

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira s operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
currency exposures include third party trade payables and receivables  and intercompany loans where the asset or liability is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity 
forward contract gains and losses on these exposures substantially offset the remeasurement of the related asset or liability  and both are included in other income  net 
in addition  currency exposures exist for certain subsidiaries for anticipated intercompany purchases  firm commitments  and third party forecasted transactions expected to be denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
forward contract gains and losses related to such exposures are also included in other income  net during the term of the forward contract  as they are not formally designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net forward contract income expense for the year ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts was a net payable of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira s primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira s investment portfolio of million at december  consists of cash and cash equivalents  equity investments in affiliated companies  and cost investments  primarily consisting of marketable securities which are classified as available for sale 
for marketable securities  any gains or losses will not be recognized in hospira s statements of income until the investment is sold or if there is a reduction in fair value that is determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december  and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira s investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
hospira has a revolver that allows borrowings up to million for working capital and other requirements 
the revolver allows hospira to borrow funds at variable interest rates as short term cash needs dictate 
the amount of available borrowings under the revolver may be increased to a maximum of million  and the term may be increased for up to two additional years  under certain circumstances 
as of december   hospira had no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
in conjunction with the acquisition of mayne pharma  on march   hospira issued million principal amount of floating rate notes due in that bear interest at a three month libor plus basis points 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million 
also  on february   hospira incurred a million  three year term loan facility bearing interest at libor plus a margin that is determined based on hospira s senior unsecured debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s 
as of december  the outstanding balance on the term loan was million 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million 
in conjunction with the spin off from abbott  on june   hospira completed an underwritten offering of a consolidated million aggregate principal amount consisting of million five year senior unsecured notes and million year senior unsecured notes  both of which bear a fixed rate of interest 
in january  hospira entered into interest rate swap transactions whereby the million five year senior unsecured notes due in june were effectively converted from fixed to floating rate debt 
hospira records the interest rate swap contracts at fair value and offsets the carrying amount of the fixed rate debt by the same amount 
at december  and  these interest rate swaps had an aggregate fair market value of million and million  respectively 
if these derivative instruments had been terminated at december  and  this estimated fair value represents the amount that hospira would have to pay to counterparties 
as a result of converting from fixed to floating rate debt  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million
