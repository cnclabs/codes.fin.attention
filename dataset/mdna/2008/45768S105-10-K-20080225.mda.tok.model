item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
general we were spun off almost ten years ago from our then parent company  chemtura corporation  previously known as great lakes chemical corporation 
our primary business was the manufacture and sale of petroleum fuel additives  in particular  the lead octane additive for gasoline  tetra ethyl lead tel 
worldwide use of tel has declined dramatically resulting in a general rate of decline in volume terms in the last few years of between and a year 
as a result  we have shifted our business focus from octane additives to the development  manufacture and marketing of fuel specialties and active chemicals 
we divide our business into three distinct segments for both management and reporting purposes fuel specialties  active chemicals previously performance chemicals as explained below and octane additives 
the fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses both operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities 
the octane additives business  although still profitable  is characterized by substantial declining demand 
on october  the company announced a further streamlining of its fast growing performance chemicals division into a unified  sales led global business focused on rapidly meeting customers needs anywhere in three geographical regions and five core industry sectors 
this led to the segment being re branded under the banner active chemicals 
the five core industry sectors are personal care  household  industrial institutional  fragrance ingredients  plastics polymers and pulp paper markets 
for the year ended december   the combined operating income of the fuel specialties and active chemicals segments of our business rose  as compared with the year ended december  by comparison  for the year ended december   operating income for the octane additives segment was million  which represents a decline of compared with the year ended december  the octane additives segment of our business will continue to decline as the last remaining countries that continue to allow tel for use in automotive gasoline shift over to unleaded 
we expect that we will cease all sales of tel for use in automotive gasoline at some time in the next several years  and that we will continue to impair the octane additives business goodwill until or prior to that point 
however  we have succeeded in implementing our strategic plan of creating sufficient growth in the fuel specialties and active chemicals segments of our business to more than offset the decline in the octane additives business 
the fuel specialties business develops  manufactures  blends and markets a range of specialty chemical products used as additives to a wide range of fuels 
the business grew initially through a program of acquisitions and more recently  organically  through the development of new products  and increases in sales and profitability 

table of contents the active chemicals business provides effective technology based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the personal care  household  industrial institutional  fragrance ingredients  plastics polymers and pulp paper markets 
this business has also grown through acquisitions  which we intend to continue in the future  while we also seek to develop new products and continue organic growth 
the octane additives business is the world s only producer of tel for use in automotive gasoline 
we are continuing to manage the decrease in the sales of tel for use in automotive gasoline to maximize the cash flow through the decline 
continuous cost improvement measures have been  and will continue to be  taken to respond to declining market demand 
we use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe the sources of these are adequate for our current operations 
raw materials account for a substantial portion of our variable manufacturing costs 
these materials are  with the exception of ethylene in germany  readily available from more than one source 
we use long term contracts generally with fixed prices and escalation terms to help ensure availability  continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases for some raw materials with commodity swaps 
nevertheless  raw materials are subject to price fluctuations and we may be exposed to risk as prices of these raw materials increase as a result of factors that are not within our control 
we are subject to extensive regulation by local  state  federal and foreign governmental authorities both with respect to the methods by which we manufacture and market products and how we conduct our business 
in that regard  we are exposed to risks that we may incur liabilities and costs in order to conform to required regulations or in the event that we fail to comply with any laws or regulations 
we are currently the subject of two investigations by us government authorities relating to certain aspects of our international operations 
on february   the sec notified us that it had commenced an investigation to determine whether any violations of law had occurred in connection with our transactions under the united nations oil for food program between june  and december  in we made voluntary disclosure of possible violations of the cuban assets control regulations to the us office of foreign assets control regarding transactions and activities engaged in cuba by certain of our non us subsidiaries 
management believes that at this time it is still not able to predict with any certainty how the us government will calculate the number of possible violations of these laws and regulations that may have occurred or the nature or amount of penalties to which we could be subject 
critical accounting estimates our objective is to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows together with our financial position 
we aim to achieve this by disclosing information required by the sec together with further information that provides insight into our businesses 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses innospec s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data disclose our accounting principles and the methods and estimates used in the preparation of those consolidated financial statements 
we believe those statements and disclosures represent fairly the operating results and financial position of the company 
the purpose of this portion of our report is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in results of operations or financial position 
the policies and estimates that the company considers the most critical in terms of subjectivity and judgment of assessment are provided below 
environmental liabilities remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our united kingdom site 
the company records environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be estimated reasonably 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future costs  and has to comply with environmental legislation in the relevant countries 
the company views the costs of vacating our main united kingdom site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of tel  particularly in the market for aviation gas  there exists such uncertainty as to the timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate these flows sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision 
goodwill the company adopted fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  this requires that goodwill deemed to have an indefinite life should no longer be amortized  but subject to an annual impairment review  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company elected to perform its annual tests in respect of fuel specialties and active chemicals goodwill as of december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the reporting units underlying the segments is estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best estimates at that time 
during and  the goodwill impairment test for the octane additives business was performed annually at december both these reviews showed that the fair value of the reporting unit based on after tax cash flows at the company s weighted average cost of capital exceeded the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  no indicator of impairment existed and step of the fas impairment test was not performed 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives business are reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives reporting unit is reduced 
based on the company s detailed forecast model  assumptions at december  indicated that the reduction in forecast future cash flows during would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  there was likely to be a significant goodwill impairment charge during the year ended december  as a result the company determined that quarterly impairment reviews be performed from january  and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
the value of the remaining cash flows from the octane additives business is calculated at any review date by reference to the best available estimates for future revenues  gross margins  selling and administrative costs as well as the fixed and working capital requirements of the business 
the resulting cash flows are then discounted and the total discounted cash flows of the octane additives business are then allocated to the fair value of the octane additives business unit at that date 
the company uses this information to derive an implied goodwill value which is then compared to the carrying value to determine what impairment is needed 
using this methodology and the assumptions underlying the detailed forecast model the company believes that it is possible to predict the pattern of likely future impairment charges of octane additives business goodwill 
this method reflects the relatively unique nature of the octane additives business 
as a result of the octane additives impairment reviews performed during  and impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  were recognized 
these charges are non cash in nature and have no impact on taxation 
there is million of goodwill remaining which relates to the octane additives business 
given the quantum and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the octane additives business the company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an approximate straight line basis over the three years ending december  
table of contents at december  we had million of goodwill relating to our fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses 
at this date we performed annual impairment reviews and concluded that there has been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments 
intangible assets  net of amortization at december  we had million of intangibles that are discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets relate to all of our business segments and are being amortized straight line over periods of up to years 
we continually assess the markets and products related to these intangibles  as well as their specific carrying values  and have concluded that these carrying values and amortization periods remain appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
if events occur or circumstances change it may possibly cause a reduction in periods over which these intangibles are amortized or result in a non cash impairment of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in amortization periods would have no effect on cash flows 
pensions the company s principal pension arrangement is a contributory defined benefit pension plan the plan in the united kingdom though it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the united kingdom and overseas 
the company accounts for the plan in accordance with fas  employers accounting for pensions  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
at december  the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation were million and million  respectively  resulting in a surplus of million 
further disclosure is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
movements in the underlying plan asset value and projected benefit obligation are dependent on actual return on investments and pay awards as well as our assumptions in respect of the discount rate  annual member mortality rates  future return on assets  future pay escalation  future pension increases and future inflation 
we develop these assumptions after considering advice from a major global actuarial consulting firm 
a change in any one of these assumptions could impact the plan asset value  projected benefit obligation and pension cost recognized in the income statement 
such changes could impact our operating results and financial position 
a change in either the discount rate assumption  or level of price inflation assumption  would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately million and the net pension charge for by approximately million 
a full actuarial valuation of the plan was performed as at december  and an update performed as at december  and  the results of both of which are reflected in these consolidated financial statements 
the company is contributing amounts to the plan to cover service costs to date 
employee and employer contributions from january  were 
table of contents at and  respectively  of pensionable pay 
in addition  since march  the company has been contributing million per calendar year in accordance with a year deficit recovery plan 
the estimated level of company contributions into the plan for is million 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions at december   we had a valuation allowance aggregating million against all of our foreign tax credit carry forwards and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of fas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with fas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent periods  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our expectation is that we are unlikely to use the foreign tax credits and uncertainty about profitability in certain foreign locations for future periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under fas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities in accordance with the recognition criteria of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement may require cash payments and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents the tel for use in aviation gasoline avtel business growth was due to volume up percentage points and price up percentage points 
the results were positively impacted by the more favorable pricing allowed  and the volumes to be sold  under the ethyl settlement 
gross margin the year on year decline of percentage points reflects both the lower proportion of higher margin avtel sales together with the adverse impact of lower tel production volumes on the fixed cost base of the manufacturing site at ellesmere port  united kingdom 
gross margins in the remainder of the markets remained largely constant as we successfully passed raw material price increases onto our customers

this was offset by a million reduction in our custom manufacturing revenues primarily due to the slow down in the us construction industry 
emea primarily benefited from strong polymer sales which increased million year on year 
there were also stronger sales in respect of our fragrances business 
our aspac business currently represents less than of our overall active chemicals business reflecting the embryonic stage of its development 
notwithstanding this  sales were driven higher by the strong performance in polymer and fragrance products consistent with our other geographical regions

americas sales were driven by our strong market leading position in diesel fuel additives and the us government s adoption early in of new ultra low sulfur diesel regulations 
approximately half of the emea sales growth was due to a one off contract with a single customer

this sales growth and tight cost control has been achieved by leveraging the infrastructure of this business 
octane additives net sales the sales decline was limited to in dollar terms despite volumes decreasing primarily due to the richer sales mix in  compared to  and moderate price increases achieved during sales volumes were adversely impacted by south africa leaving the market for tel for use in automotive gasoline at the start of the year  and the absence in of significant shipments to south east asia 
however  sales to the middle east in remained resilient 
gross margin the percentage points improvement in gross margin reflected the richer sales mix and moderate price increases achieved during operating expenses the reduction in operating expenses compares to the sales decline experienced in this business 
the majority of the savings were generated from reduced commission charges caused by the absence of sales to south east asia

there were no significant intangible asset additions or disposals in or that would impact the amortization charge 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the charge was significantly higher than that recognized in due to the loss of anticipated sales and associated cash flows from venezuela  a major customer  in the second quarter of in there were no significant changes in the estimates used in the detailed forecast model to calculate the impairment charges 
profit on disposal net the company recognized million profit following the disposal of surplus real estate in the united kingdom 
this was partially offset by prepaid disposal costs of million 
interest expense net net interest expense declined by million in to million 
this was primarily due to including the receipt of million interest previously

in our working capital increased by million 
the million increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses was spread across our three business units as a result of the increased trading in our fuel specialties and active chemicals growth businesses and the impact of the timing of octane additives shipments compared to the corresponding period last year 
inventories increased by million also in all three business units though it was focused in fuel specialties and octane additives  the latter being due to the unwind of approximately million of ethyl inventory working capital arrangements following the settlement regarding the tmas 
the million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was limited to a moderate increase within active chemicals due to increased trading levels  and somewhat larger increases within fuel specialties and octane additives reflecting the significantly increased trading levels and recognition of a million legal accrual  respectively 

table of contents cash at december  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
debt at december  we had a credit facility which provides for borrowings by us of up to million including a term loan of million and revolving credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility can be drawn down upon until the financing facility expires on june  the facility also contains terms which  if breached  would result in the loan becoming repayable on demand 
it requires  among other matters  compliance with two financial covenant ratios 
these ratios are the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the ratio of net interest to ebita 
ebitda and ebita are non us gaap measures of liquidity defined in the finance facility 
in the event that the ratio of net debt to ebitda exceeds then in addition to these covenants  the facility also requires a look forward test and an additional financial covenant ratio in the form of net operating cash flow before finance costs to scheduled debt amortization and interest costs 
this look forward test was not applicable to the company during due to such ratio not being exceeded 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its senior credit facility agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants therein 
the debt profile as at december   including the principal facility  is set out below in millions current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current portion on january  the company repaid the scheduled million under the term loan facility and drew down million under the revolving credit facility 
pension plans and other post employment benefits effective for fiscal year  the company adopted the provisions of fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
fas requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheets  and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income 
fas also requires the measurement date of the plan s funded status to be the same as the company s fiscal year end 
although the measurement date provision was not required to be adopted until fiscal year the company early adopted this provision for fiscal year the effect of applying fas was to record a total reduction to equity through recognition in other comprehensive loss of million on an after tax basis

at the same date long term debt obligations represent scheduled term loan repayments and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility repaid when the financing facility expires on june  on january  the company repaid the scheduled million under the term loan facility and drew down million under the revolving credit facility 
remediation payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of current and former facilities 
it does not include any discretionary remediation costs that the company may choose to incur 
severance payments represent those cash flows that the company is currently obligated to pay in respect of severance costs recognized under the conditions of fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and fas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
raw material purchase obligations relate to certain long term raw material contracts which have been entered into by the company that stipulate fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty 
capital commitments relate to certain capital projects that the company has committed to undertake 
operating lease commitments relate primarily to office space  motor vehicles and items of office equipment which are expected to be renewed and replaced in the normal course of business 

table of contents the company is subject to interest at variable rates on certain elements of its long term debt 
the estimated payments included in the table above assume a constant us base interest rate of on the main credit facility 
estimated commitment fees are also included and interest income is excluded 
the amounts related to the pension plan refer to the likely levels of company funding of the united kingdom contributory defined benefit pension plan and certain pension commitments to senior employees 
it is not meaningful to predict an amount after five years since there are numerous uncertainties including future return on assets  pay escalation  pension increases  inflation and employment levels 
environmental matters and plant closures the company is subject to environmental laws in all of the countries in which it operates 
under certain environmental laws the company is responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances or wastes at currently or formerly owned or operated properties 
most of our manufacturing operations have been conducted outside the us and  therefore  any liability pertaining to the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties is likely to be determined under non us law 
we evaluate costs for remediation  decontamination and demolition projects on a regular basis 
full provision is made for those costs to which we are committed under environmental laws 
full provision has been made for the committed costs of million 
expenditure against provisions was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
we have also incurred personnel severance costs in relation to the management of the decline in the octane additives market and the restructuring of the fuel specialties and active chemicals businesses 
total severance expenditure was million  million  million in the years  and  respectively 
provision is made for severance costs under the conditions of fas and fas contingencies oil for food on february   the securities and exchange commission sec notified the company that it had commenced an investigation to determine whether any violations of law had occurred in connection with transactions conducted by the company  including its wholly owned indirect subsidiary  alcor chemie vertriebs gmbh alcor  a swiss company  under the united nations oil for food program offp between june  and december  as part of its investigation  the sec issued a subpoena requiring the production of certain documents  including documents relating to these transactions  by the company and alcor 
upon receipt of the sec s notification and initial subpoena  the company undertook a review of its participation in the offp 
on october  and november  the sec 
table of contents served two additional subpoenas on the company 
these additional subpoenas required the production of documents relating notably to the offp but also relating to transactions conducted by the company or its subsidiaries with state owned or controlled entities between june  and the date of such subpoenas  relating to its use of foreign agents and the possibility of extra contractual payments made to secure business with foreign governmental entities 
in a co ordinated investigation  the company has also been contacted by the us department of justice doj regarding the possibility of violations of relevant laws in the areas contained in the sec subpoenas as well as additional preliminary inquiries regarding compliance with anti trust laws relating to us and international tetra ethyl lead markets 
the subjects into which the sec and doj have inquired include areas that involve certain former and current executives of the company including the current ceo 
the company  and its officers and directors  are cooperating with the sec and doj investigations 
on february   the board of directors of the company formed a committee comprised of the chairmen of the board  the audit committee and the nominating and governance committee respectively  all of whom are independent directors 
counsel to the company  providing assistance to the committee has  on behalf of the committee  conducted and will continue to conduct an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the sec and doj investigations 
counsel will report directly to the committee and will assist in connection with interactions with the sec and doj 
while the outcome of these investigations is uncertain  a number of companies involved in the offp investigations have been required to disgorge profits and pay civil fines and penalties up to million 
as a result of information discovered in the course of the investigation  we expect that we will be required to disgorge profits and pay fines and penalties that could be of similar magnitude 
any settlement of the sec and doj inquiries relating to matters beyond the offp could require the company to make significant additional disgorgements  penalty and fine payments 
however at this time management is not able to predict with certainty the level of such fines and penalties 
because of the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of these investigations and the costs to the company of responding and participating in these on going investigations  no assurance can be given that the ultimate costs and sanctions that may be imposed upon us will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows from operating activities 
at december  we have accrued million in respect of probable future legal expenses in respect of this matter and have provided no additional accruals for this matter 
inflation inflation has not been a significant factor for the company over the last several years 
management believes that inflation will continue to be moderate over the next several years

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing and blending facilities  offices and laboratories around the world  though the largest manufacturing facility is located in the united kingdom 
the company sells a range of fuel specialties  active chemicals and octane additives to customers around the world 
the company uses floating rate debt to finance these global operations 
consequently  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps  commodity swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to monitor the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with such changes 
the company offers fixed prices for some long term sales contracts 
as manufacturing costs and raw materials are subject to variability the company uses commodity swaps to hedge the price of some raw materials thus reducing volatility on earnings and cash flows 
the derivatives are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
the company s objective is to manage its exposure to fluctuating prices of raw materials 
interest rate risk the company uses interest swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as of december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  no bank overdraft and long term debt including current portion of million 
the long term debt comprised million senior term loan and million revolving credit 
in and the company entered into interest swap agreements to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate that cover million and million  respectively  of the remaining long term debt including current portion as at december  of million 
on the basis that million of the million long term debt including current portion is hedged against interest movements and that the company would receive interest on the million positive cash balances  then unhedged debt of million is largely covered by the positive cash balances 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances  a hypothetical absolute change of in us base interest rates on the gross amount of these balances of million for a one year period would impact net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 

table of contents the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity nor management action to mitigate such changes 
exchange rate risk the company generates an element of its revenues and incurs some operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency due to the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in addition  the financial position and results of operations of some of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro and british pound sterling 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  to the extent such figures reflect the inclusion of foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our results of operations 
the trading of our three business segments are inherently naturally hedged and accordingly changes in exchange rates would not be material to our earnings or financial position 
corporate costs however are largely denominated in british pound sterling 
a strengthening in the us dollar against british pound sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million 
where a strengthening of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a weakening would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income 
raw material price risk we use a variety of raw materials  chemicals and energy in our manufacturing and blending processes 
many of the raw materials that we use are derived from petrochemical based feedstocks which can be subject to periods of rapid and significant price instability 
these fluctuations in price can be caused by political instability in oil producing nations and elsewhere  or other factors influencing global supply and demand over which we have no or little control 
innospec has entered hedging arrangements for certain raw materials  but does not typically enter into hedging arrangements for all raw materials  chemicals or energy costs 
should costs of raw materials  chemicals or energy increase  and should innospec s businesses not be able to pass on these cost increases to our customers  then operating margins and cash flows from operating activities would be adversely impacted 
should raw material prices increase significantly  then the company s need for working capital could increase which would adversely impact cash flows from operating activities
