tissue preservation services cryolife markets its preservation services to tissue procurement agencies  implanting physicians  and prospective tissue recipients 
the company works with tissue banks and organ procurement agencies to ensure consistent and continued availability of donated human tissue for transplant and educates physicians and prospective tissue recipients with respect to the benefits of preserved human tissues 
procurement of tissue 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ procurement agencies and tissue banks 
after procurement  the tissue is packed and shipped  together with certain information about the tissue and its donor  to the company in accordance with the company s protocols 
the tissue is transported to the company s laboratory facilities via commercial airlines pursuant to arrangements with qualified courier services 
timely receipt of procured tissue is important as tissue that is not received promptly cannot be cryopreserved successfully 
the procurement agency is reimbursed by the company for the costs associated with these procurement services 
the procurement fee and related shipping costs  together with the charges for the preservation services of the company  are ultimately paid to the company by the hospital or healthcare facility with which the implanting physician is associated 
since the company has received tissue from over  donors 
the company has developed relationships with approximately tissue banks and organ procurement agencies throughout the us management believes these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides the company with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market 
the company employs over individuals in donor services and donor quality assurance to work with organ procurement agencies and tissue banks 
this includes five account managers who are stationed throughout the country to work directly with the organ procurement agencies 
the company s central office for procurement relations is staffed hours per day  days per year 
preservation of tissue 
upon receiving tissue  a company technician completes the documentation control for the tissue prepared by the procurement agency and gives it a control number 
the documentation identifies  among other things  donor age and cause of death 
a trained technician then removes the portion or portions of the delivered tissue that will be processed 
these procedures are conducted under aseptic conditions in clean rooms 
at the same time  samples are taken from the donated tissue and subjected to the company s quality assurance program 
this program  which includes review of the donor and tissue charts by cryolife s tissue quality assurance department and its medical directors  may identify characteristics which would disqualify the tissue for preservation or implantation 
once the tissue is approved  it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status 
tissue that does not pass testing is appropriately discarded 
the company s cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues have been preserved in a proprietary freezing process conducted according to company protocols 
after the preservation process  the tissues are transferred to liquid nitrogen freezers for long term storage at temperatures at or below c 
the entire preservation process is controlled by guidelines established by the company 
distribution of tissue to implanting physicians 
after the tissue has cleared quality control assurance and the tissue is moved to an implantable status  the tissue is stored by the company or is delivered directly to hospitals at the implanting physician s request 
cryopreserved tissue must be transported under stringent handling conditions and maintained within specific temperature tolerances at all times 
cryopreserved tissue is packaged for shipment using the company s proprietary processes 
at the hospital the tissue is implanted immediately or is held in a liquid nitrogen freezer according to company protocols pending implantation 
the company provides a detailed protocol for thawing the cryopreserved tissue 
the company also makes its technical personnel available by phone or in person to answer questions 
after the company transports the tissue to the hospital  the company invoices the institution for its services  the procurement fee  and transportation costs 
the company provides company owned liquid nitrogen freezers to certain client hospitals 
the company has currently installed approximately of these freezers 
participating hospitals generally pay the cost of liquid nitrogen and regular maintenance 
the availability of on site freezers makes it easier for a hospital s physicians to utilize the company s preservation services by making the cryopreserved tissue more readily available 
because fees for the company s preservation services become due upon the shipment of tissue to the hospital  the use of such on site freezers also reduces the company s working capital needs 
marketing  educational  and technical support 
the company has records of over  cardiac and vascular surgeons who have implanted tissues preserved by the company during the past twelve months 
the company works to maintain relationships with and market to surgeons within these medical specialties 
because the company markets its preservation services directly to physicians  an important aspect of increasing the distribution of the company s preservation services is educating physicians on the use of preserved human tissue and on proper implantation techniques 
trained field support personnel provide support to implanting institutions and surgeons 
the company currently employs approximately persons as technical service representatives and five region managers who deal primarily with cardiac and vascular surgeons and provide field support 
the company sponsors physician training seminars where physicians teach other physicians the proper technique for handling and implanting preserved human tissue 
the company also produces educational videotapes for physicians and coordinates peer to peer training at various medical institutions 
in addition the company coordinates laboratory sessions that utilize animal tissue to demonstrate surgical techniques 
management believes that these activities improve the medical community s acceptance of the preserved human tissue processed by the company and help to differentiate the company from other allograft processors 
to assist procurement agencies and tissue banks  the company provides educational materials and training on procurement  dissection  packaging  and shipping techniques 
the company also produces educational videotapes and coordinates laboratory sessions on procurement techniques for procurement agency personnel 
to supplement its educational activities  the company employs in house technical specialists that provide technical information and assistance and maintains a staff hours per day  days per year for customer support 
medical devices the company markets and distributes cardiowrap in the us and the united kingdom 
the company markets and distributes the cryolife o brien stentless porcine aortic bioprosthesis in europe 
marketing efforts for the cryolife o brien aortic bioprosthesis and cardiowrap are primarily directed toward cardiac surgeons 
european operations the company markets its products in the emea region through its european subsidiary  cryolife europa ltd  based in guildford  united kingdom 
europa  with its team of approximately fourteen employees  provides customer service  logistics  marketing  and clinical support to cardiac  vascular  thoracic  and general surgeons throughout the emea region 
europa markets and distributes the company s complete range of products through its direct sales representatives in great britain and germany and a network of independent distributors in the emea region 
backlog the limited supply of tissue that is donated and available for processing typically results in a backlog of orders in the company s human tissue business 
the amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases 
the company s backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment 
the company currently does not have a backlog of orders related to bioglue  cryolife o brien aortic bioprosthesis  or cardiowrap 
competition bioglue the company competes with many domestic and international medical device and pharmaceutical companies 
in the surgical adhesive and surgical sealant area  the company competes primarily with baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal  ethicon s evicel  surgiflo and surgifoam  and covidien s us surgical division s duraseal products 
additionally  johnson johnson is under fda review for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing 
the company currently competes with these products based on the products benefits and features  such as strength and ease of use 
competitive products may also be under development by other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  research and development  regulatory and clinical  manufacturing  marketing and sales  and personnel resources than the company 
these competitors may also have greater experience in developing products  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing such products 
certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection  approval  or clearance by the fda or foreign countries  or product commercialization earlier than the company  any of which could materially adversely affect the company 
the company could also have to compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities 
other recently developed technologies or procedures are  or may in the future be  the basis of competitive products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current competitors or other parties will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use  or more economical than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive in these fields 
in such event  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see part i  item a  risk factors risks relating to our business rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
preserved human tissues and bioprosthetic cardiac and vascular devices the company currently faces competition from at least two non profit tissue banks that cryopreserve and distribute human cardiac and vascular tissue  as well as from several companies that market mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  and synthetic vascular grafts for implantation 
many established companies  some with resources greater than those of the company  are engaged in manufacturing  marketing  and selling alternatives to preserved human tissue 
management believes that it competes with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
management believes that the human heart valves preserved by the company  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above  as well as by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
the company believes its recent approval of its synergraft processed human pulmonary heart valve as discussed in and events will enable the company to compete with other valves by providing a valve processed with a technology designed to remove donor cells and cellular remnants from the valve without compromising the integrity of the underlying collagen matrix 
generally  for each procedure that may utilize vascular human tissue that the company preserves  there are alternative treatments 
often  in the case of veins  these alternatives include the repair  partial removal  or complete removal of the damaged tissue and may utilize other tissues from the patients themselves or synthetic products 
the attending physician  in consultation with the patient  makes the selection of treatment choices 
any newly developed treatments may also compete with the use of tissue preserved by the company 
human and stentless porcine heart valves 
alternatives to human heart valves preserved by the company include mechanical valves  porcine valves  and valves constructed from bovine pericardium 
st 
jude medical  inc is the leading supplier of mechanical heart valves  and has a marketing and distribution arrangement with a non profit tissue bank for supplies of preserved human heart valves 
medtronic  inc is the leading supplier of porcine heart valves 
edwards life sciences  inc is the leading supplier of bovine pericardial heart valves 
in addition management believes that at least two domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for human heart valves in competition with the company 
the company presently distributes its stentless porcine heart valve only outside the us this stentless porcine heart valve competes with mechanical valves  stented and stentless porcine valves  human heart valves  and processed bovine pericardial heart valves 
the company is aware of at least six other companies that offer porcine and bovine pericardial heart valves 
human vascular tissue 
there are a number of providers of synthetic alternatives to veins preserved by the company and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters 
currently  management believes that there is at least one other non profit tissue bank that preserves and distributes human vascular tissue in competition with the company 
companies offering either synthetic or allograft products may enter this market in the future 
research and development the company endeavors to use its expertise in protein chemistry  biochemistry  and cell biology  and its understanding of the needs of the cardiac and vascular surgery medical specialties to expand its surgical adhesive and preservation businesses and to develop or acquire implantable products and technologies for these specialties 
the company seeks to identify market areas that can benefit from preserved living tissues  implantable medical devices  and other related technologies  to develop innovative techniques and products within these areas  to secure their commercial protection  to establish their efficacy  and then to market these techniques and products 
the company employs approximately people in its research and development and clinical research departments  including six phds with specialties in the fields of molecular biology  protein chemistry  vascular physiology  biochemistry  and bioengineering 
in order to expand the company s service and product offerings  the company is currently in the process of developing or investigating several technologies and products  including technologies related to human tissue preservation  its pht product platform used in bioglue  biodisc  biofoam  and other bioglue derivatives  additional applications of its synergraft technology  and organ transplant solutions 
biofoam  a product in the pht platform  is in preclinical development 
biofoam contains a foaming agent  which has the potential to rapidly fill and seal internal body cavities  such as aneurysm sacs  and may provide hemostatsis in penetrating wounds and trauma 
the    and us congress defense appropriations conference reports included  million  million  and million  respectively  for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology for use on the battlefield 
the company applied for and was awarded the full  under the bill and million under the bill 
the company applied for funding for biofoam development under the bill but has not yet been notified of an award decision 
the company anticipates applying for funding under the bill during cryolife is currently involved in initial animal trials related to this grant 
biodisc  a product in the pht platform  is undergoing clinical evaluation to determine its utility as a nucleus pulposus replacement in spinal disc repair 
the nucleus pulposus is surrounded by fibrous tissue annulus fibrosis and is located in the center of the vertebral disc 
the nucleus pulposus is composed of a gelatinous like material that in conjunction with the annulus fibrosis acts as a cushion or shock absorber to the spinal column 
if the nucleus pulposus herniates through the annulus  it may be removed in a procedure known as a discectomy 
biodisc is designed to fill the area where the nucleus pulposus was removed and is intended to preserve disc height  reduce lumbar motion segment instability  and reduce recurrent disc herniation 
a ten patient study enrollment and a year follow up have been completed 
an interim analysis of the data was used for ce mark submission in february the company is waiting to hear the results of the submission from its notified body 
in october the company signed a licensing and distribution agreement with bioform for the development and commercialization of bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications 
the agreement calls for bioform to fund the clinical development and regulatory approval process for commercializing bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications in the us  canada  and various countries in europe 
in addition bioform will oversee all aspects of the marketing  sales  and distribution of bioglue in the us  canada  and various countries in europe for these indications 
cryolife will remain the exclusive supplier of bioglue for all applications 
under the terms of the agreement  cryolife received an initial fee from bioform and will receive a milestone payment upon the first fda approval for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications 
bioform is currently conducting a feasibility study under an investigational device exemption  or ide  from the fda 
bioform s strategy is to determine compelling aesthetic applications for bioglue  demonstrate safety and effectiveness of this material in aesthetic applications  and launch bioglue as an alternative fixation methodology to improve browplasty and certain other surgical and minimally invasive aesthetic procedures 
in january the company signed an exclusive license agreement with trophic to develop and market products related to the cold storage and preservation of internal organs prior to transport 
under terms of the agreement  the company will license from trophic the right to develop  manufacture  and market products and processes derived from a patent owned by trophic  which relates to solutions containing purified antimicrobial polypeptides and or cell surface receptor binding proteins for use in the storage and preservation of internal organs prior to transplant 
in early animal and human studies  the trophic technology has shown that kidneys may be stored for up to six days prior to transplant without compromising kidney function rather than three days using present technology 
these studies also indicate that the solution may reduce or eliminate the need for pumping kidneys  which may reduce the cost of maintaining and transporting kidneys for transplant 
the agreement gives cryolife the exclusive right to determine if a commercial product can be developed using the process covered by the patent for a period of one year  which may be extended for an additional ninety days 
at the fda s request  cryolife is planning a post clearance study to seek evidence for the potential and implied long term benefits of the synergraft process 
data to be collected is expected to include long term safety and hemodynamic function  immune response  and explant analysis 
cryolife believes that this information may help it ascertain whether the synergraft process reduces the immune response of the transplanted heart valve and allows for the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s own cells 
in addition cryolife intends to investigate whether the synergraft technology can be applied to other human or animal tissues 
to the extent the company identifies additional applications for its products  the company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development of such applications or seek funding from outside sources to continue the commercial development of such technologies 
the company may also attempt to license additional technologies from third parties to supplement its product lines 
the company s research and development strategy is to allocate available resources among the company s core market areas of preservation services and implantable medical devices  based on the size of the potential market for any specific product candidate and the estimated development time and cost required to bring the product to market 
research on these and other projects is conducted in the company s research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where the company sponsors research projects 
the company s medical and scientific advisory board consults on various research and development programs 
the company s preclinical studies are conducted at universities and other locations outside the company s facilities by third parties under contract with the company 
in addition to these efforts the company may pursue other research and development activities 
in   and the company spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development activities on new and existing products 
these amounts represented approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years   and  respectively

in the laboratory packaged approximately  human tissues 
the current processing level is estimated to be at about of total capacity 
the volume of tissue processed is currently constrained by the availability of donated tissue 
to produce at full capacity levels  cryolife would have to increase the amount of donated tissues  which the company could attempt to do by increasing the number of relationships with organ procurement agencies and tissue banks  or working to increase donor awareness to increase tissue donation 
if additional donated tissues were obtained  the company would need to increase the number of employees  expand its second and third shift  and add equipment 
bioglue bioglue is presently manufactured at the company s headquarters facility 
the laboratory contains approximately  square feet  including a suite of six clean rooms 
currently  there are technicians employed in this area

patents  licenses  and other proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements  and security procedures to protect its proprietary products  processing technology  trade secrets  and know how 
the company believes that its patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and technology licensing rights provide it with important competitive advantages 
the company owns or has licensed rights to us patents and foreign patents  including patents relating to its technology for human cardiac and vascular tissue preservation  tissue revitalization prior to freezing  tissue transport  bioglue  pht  and tissue packaging 
the company has approximately pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications that relate to areas including the company s cryopreservation  pht  and other areas 
there can be no assurance that any patents pending will result in issued patents 
the remaining duration of the company s issued patents ranges from to years 
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in any of the company s existing or future patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products  processes  and technologies or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
to the extent that any of the company s products or services are not effectively patent protected  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
under current law  patent applications in the us and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
the right to a patent in the us is attributable to the first to invent  not the first to file a patent application 
the company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that its products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may incur substantial legal fees in defending against a patent infringement claim or in asserting claims against third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from marketing certain of its products  could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents  or could be required to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
the company s failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign its products or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company has agreements with third parties for certain technologies related to its bioglue  and synergraft technologies that call for the payment of royalties based on revenues of such products 
the company has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees  several of its consultants  and third party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the obligations of employees of the company and third parties with whom the company has entered into confidentiality agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information or provide meaningful protection for the company s confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the company s competitors 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents and trademarks of the company  or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us government regulation us federal regulation of medical devices because bioglue and certain human heart valves are  and other company products may in the future be  regulated as medical devices  the company and these products are subject to the provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdca and implementing regulations of the fda 
pursuant to the fdca  the fda regulates the manufacture  distribution  labeling  and promotion of medical devices in the us also  various foreign countries in which the company s products are  or may be  distributed impose additional regulatory requirements 
the fdca provides that  unless exempted by regulation  medical devices may not be distributed in the us unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the fda 
there are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive such approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance to be marketed under a section k procedure  in which the manufacturer provides a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product  and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed k product ie  that it has the same intended use  it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed k device  and it does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device 
in some cases the submission must include data from clinical studies 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed k device or because it is a class iii device required by the fdca and implementing regulations to have an approved application for premarket approval pma  the fda must approve a pma application before marketing can begin 
pma applications must demonstrate  among other matters  that the medical device is safe and effective 
a pma application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of human clinical studies  and preparing an application is a detailed and time consuming process 
once a pma application has been submitted  the fda s review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data 
the fdca also provides for an investigational device exemption ide which authorizes distribution for clinical evaluation of devices that lack a pma or k clearance 
devices subject to an ide are subject to various restrictions imposed by the fda 
the number of patients that may be treated with the device is limited  as is the number of institutions at which the device may be used 
patients must give informed consent to be treated with an investigational device  and review by an institutional review board is needed 
the device must be labeled that it is for investigational use and may not be advertised or otherwise promoted and the price charged for the device may be limited 
unexpected adverse experiences must be reported to the fda 
under certain circumstances  the fda may grant a humanitarian device exemption hde 
the fda grants hde s in an attempt to encourage the development of medical devices for use in the treatment of rare conditions that affect small patient populations 
an approval by the fda exempts such devices from full compliance with clinical study requirements for a pma 
the fdca requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the fda annually and to provide the fda with a list of those medical devices that they distribute commercially 
the fdca also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with quality system regulations  which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in a prescribed manner with respect to good manufacturing practices  design  document production  process  labeling and packaging controls  process validation  and other quality control activities 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the fda on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the us follow certain procedures before they are exported 
the fda inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors and has authority to seize noncomplying medical devices  enjoin and or impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non complying medical devices  criminally prosecute violators  and order recalls in certain instances 
human heart valves 
the company s human heart valves became subject to regulation by the fda in june  when the fda published a notice stating that human heart valves were class iii medical devices under the fdca 
the june notice provided that distribution of human heart valves for transplantation would violate the fdca unless they were the subject of an approved pma or ide on or before august  on october  the fda announced in the federal register that neither an approved application for pma nor an ide is required for processors and distributors who had marketed heart valve allografts before june  this action by the fda resulted in the allograft heart valves being classified as class ii medical devices and has removed them from clinical trial status 
it also allowed the company to distribute such valves to cardiac surgeons throughout the us on may   with the promulgation of the final rule for cgtps  the fda reclassified human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue which is subject to that rule 
on february  cryolife received k clearance from the food and drug administration fda for its cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve processed with the company s proprietary synergraft technology as discussed in and events 
porcine heart valves 
porcine heart valves are class iii medical devices and fda approval of a pma is required prior to commercial distribution of such valves in the us the porcine heart valves currently marketed by the company have not been approved by the fda for commercial distribution in the us  but may be manufactured in the us and exported to foreign countries if the valves meet the specifications of the foreign purchaser and do not conflict with the laws of and are approved by the country to which they will be exported 
bioglue 
the fda regulates bioglue as a class iii medical device 
in december the company received fda approval for bioglue as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels 
prior to this approval  the company received an hde in december for bioglue for use as an adjunct in repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections 
the product is health canada  australia  and ce mark approved for additional soft tissue repair 
us federal regulation of human tissue the company s non valved conduits  vascular grafts  and orthopaedic tissues are not currently subject to regulation under the fdca as medical devices 
however  the fda does regulate these products pursuant to section of the public health services act phs act  which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products cfr parts and 
historically  heart valves were one of a small number of processed human tissues over which the fda asserted medical device jurisdiction 
concerns with the transmission of hiv and hepatitis b led the fda to issue an interim rule in december as an emergency measure to protect the public from any human tissue that had incomplete or no documentation ascertaining its freedom from communicable diseases 
the fda modified the regulation and reissued it as a new rule  effective january  which focused on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction  transmission  and spread of hiv and and hepatitis b and c 
the rule set minimal requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation 
the rule defines human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is i intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment  or prevention of any condition or disease and ii recovered  processed  stored  or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics 
the fda definition excludes  among other things  tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug  biological product  or medical device and it also excludes kidney  liver  heart  lung  pancreas  or any other vascularized human organ 
the current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability  processing standards  establishment registration  and product listing 
on january  the fda published regulations that require human cells  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products establishments to register with the agency and list their human cells  tissues  and cellular and tissue based products hct ps 
the final rule  cfr parts  became effective on april  for human tissues intended for transplantation that are regulated under section of the phs act as well as part it became effective for all other hct ps when the remaining parts of cfr part were finalized 
in may the fda published regulations governing the eligibility of donors of human cell and tissue products 
this rule expands previous requirements for testing and screening for risks of communicable diseases that could be spread by the use of these tissues 
in november the fda published regulations governing the procedures and processes related to the manufacture of human cell and tissue products under the cgtps 
both the new donor eligibility rule and the cgtp rule became effective on may  and designate human heart valves processed on or after may  as human tissue rather than medical devices 
it is likely that the fda s regulation of processed human tissue will continue to evolve in the future 
complying with fda regulatory requirements or obtaining required fda approvals or clearances may entail significant time delays and expense or may not be possible  any of which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
possible other fda regulation other products and processes under development by the company are likely to be subject to regulation by the fda 
some may be classified as medical devices or human cells and tissue products  while others may be classified as drugs  biological products  or subject to a regulatory process that the fda may adopt in the future 
regulation of drugs and biological products is substantially similar to regulation of class iii medical devices 
obtaining fda approval to market these products and processes is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process  and there can be no assurance that any of these products or processes will ever receive fda approval 
nota regulation the company s activities in processing and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act nota  which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire  receive  or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce 
nota excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of a human organ 
the purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services 
the company believes that to the extent its activities are subject to nota  it meets this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of its charges 
there can be no assurance  however  that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future that would call into question one or more aspects of the company s methods of charging for its preservation services 
state licensing requirements some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the processing  transportation  and storage of human organs and tissue 
the activities engaged in by the company require it to be licensed as a clinical laboratory and tissue bank under georgia  new york  california  maryland  and florida law 
the company has such licenses  and the company believes it is in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store  process  and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings 
there can be no assurance  however  that more restrictive state laws or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could adversely affect the company s operations 
certain employees of the company have obtained other required state licenses 
foreign approval requirements sales of medical devices and biological products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to commercial distribution of the product in those countries 
the time required to obtain foreign approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the eea recognizes a single medical device approval  called a ce mark  which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the eea member state countries european union eu countries  and european free trade association efta countries without additional general applications in each country 
however  individual eea members reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing 
third parties called notified bodies award the ce mark 
these notified bodies are approved and subject to review by the competent authorities of their respective countries 
a number of countries outside of the eea accept the ce mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that country s application process 
the company has been issued ce marks for bioglue and the cryolife o brien aortic bioprosthesis 
bioglue may be exported to more than countries outside the us and the cryolife o brien aortic bioprosthesis may be exported to more than countries outside the us environmental matters the company s tissue processing activities generate some biomedical wastes consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes  including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures 
the biomedical wastes generated by the company are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by the company 
the company contracts with third parties for transport  treatment  and disposal of biomedical waste 
although the company believes it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and the georgia department of natural resources  environmental protection division  the failure by the company  or the companies with which it contracts  to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties  fines  or sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
employees as of december  the company had approximately employees 
these employees included six persons with phd degrees  two with an md degree  and one with a md degree 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes 
management believes its relations with its employees are good 
available information it is the company s policy to make all of its filings with the sec  including  without limitation  its annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  available free of charge on the company s website  www

item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business the fda has previously issued a recall of certain of our products and has the ability to inspect our facilities  suspend our operations  and issue a recall of our products in the future 
on august  we received an order from the atlanta district office of the fda regarding the non valved cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues processed by the company since october  the fda order 
pursuant to the fda order  we placed non valve cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue processed since october  on quality assurance quarantine and recalled the portion of those tissues that had been distributed but not implanted 
in addition we ceased processing non valved cardiac and vascular tissues until mid september and ceased processing orthopaedic tissues until the fda order resulted in the destruction of much of our tissue  required that we adjust revenue for tissue recall returns  curtailed our processing activities  and subjected us to intense fda scrutiny and additional regulatory requirements that increased costs 
we also suffered decreased revenues due to lack of processing ability and decreased market demand for our services 
these challenges reduced our revenues  increased our costs to process tissues and our operating expenses  and strained management resources and available cash 
although we resumed processing and distribution of the types of tissues subject to the fda order and resolved many of the product liability suits pending against us  we incurred losses and did not produce cash from operations for many years and the foregoing factors continue to challenge us 
any future recalls or other regulatory action by the fda would likely have a material adverse impact on our revenues  cash flow and profitability 
the fda continues to periodically reinspect our facilities  review complaints against us  monitor the efficacy of our products and the claims we make regarding our products benefits  and issue reports to us on areas that require improvement 
if the fda believed that we were not responsive to their requests for any suggested improvement or that our products were not in compliance with regulatory norms  the fda has the ability to suspend our operations and issue an order for the recall of any or all of our products 
if such an order were received  our revenues  profits  and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flows  and we must continue to address the underlying causes in order to continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flows 
due principally to factors mentioned above  we suffered net losses in the years ended december  through and generated negative operating cash flow each year in the five year period ended december  there is no guarantee that we can continue to address the causes of our previous losses 
key growth strategies identified as a result of our strategic review may not generate the anticipated benefits 
in january we engaged a financial advisor to assist our management and board of directors in identifying and evaluating potential strategies to enhance shareholder value 
as a result of this review  the board of directors has directed management to actively pursue three key strategies to generate revenue and earnings growth in addition to continuing to focus on growing our business and leveraging our strengths and expertise in our core marketplaces 
these three strategies are identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies  licensing our technology to third parties for non competing uses  and analyzing and identifying underperforming assets for us to consider selling or otherwise disposing of 
although management has begun to implement these strategies  we cannot be certain that they will ultimately enhance shareholder value 
our credit facility expired on february  and our ability to pursue significant acquisitions may be dependent on obtaining a new credit facility 
on february  we entered into a million credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc to address some of our liquidity needs 
the credit facility expired on february   at which time the outstanding principal balance of million was paid from cash reserves 
if we do not obtain a new credit facility  we may be limited in our ability to pursue any significant acquisitions of products or companies  to the extent that we are unable to access the equity markets 
there are limitations on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
we estimate that at december   we had approximately million in us federal net operating loss carryforwards  which could be used to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the tax year 
we may be unable to generate enough profits  if any  prior to their expiration to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize on an annual basis is capped after an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  a change in control of our company within the meaning of section could substantially reduce the annual benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards and could  thereby  result in a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
we are significantly dependent on our revenues from bioglue and are subject to a variety of risks affecting this product 
bioglue is a significant source of our revenues 
should the product be the subject of adverse developments with regard to its safety  efficacy  or reimbursement practices  or if a competitor s product obtains greater acceptance  or our rights to manufacture and market this product are challenged  the result could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
also  we have only two suppliers of bovine serum albumen  which is necessary for the manufacture of bioglue 
furthermore  we presently have only one supplier for our new syringe 
if we lose one or more of these suppliers  our ability to manufacture and sell bioglue could be adversely impacted 
we cannot be sure that we would be able to replace any such loss on a timely basis  if at all 
we are dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
the success of our tissue preservation services depends upon  among other factors  the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
if the supply of donated human tissue is materially reduced  this would restrict our growth and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we rely primarily upon the efforts of third party procurement agencies  tissue banks most of which are not for profit  and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue 
physicians have been and may continue to be reluctant to implant our preserved tissues or use our other products 
some physicians or implanting institutions have been reluctant to choose our preserved tissues for use in implantation  due to a perception that the tissue may not be safe or to a belief that the implanting physician or hospital may be subject to a heightened liability risk if our tissues are used 
in addition  for similar reasons  some hospital risk managers have not allowed implanting surgeons to utilize our tissues when alternatives are available 
several risk managers and physicians have refused to use our products due to these concerns 
these conditions have materially and adversely affected demand for our processed human tissues 
if these conditions persist  our results of operations and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected 
if additional implanting hospitals or physicians representing significant revenues refuse to use tissues that we preserve or our other products  including bioglue  and we are unable to replace the revenues lost  our revenues and profits would be materially and adversely affected 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients  and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims and additional regulatory scrutiny as a result 
the processing  preservation  and distribution of human allograft tissue  bovine tissue products  porcine tissue products  and the manufacture and sale of medical devices entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and have resulted and may result in product liability claims against us 
plaintiffs have asserted that our tissue or medical devices have caused a variety of injuries  including death 
when patients are injured  die  or have other adverse results following procedures using our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be sued and our insurance coverage has been and may be inadequate 
adverse judgments and settlements in excess of our available insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of medical complications that are alleged to have been caused by or occur in connection with medical procedures involving our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be subject to additional fda and other regulatory scrutiny and inspections 
for example  shortly after the fda order  the fda posted a notice  now archived  on its website stating its concerns regarding our heart valve preservation services 
as a result  some surgeons and hospitals decided not to use our heart valves 
cautionary statements from the fda or other regulators regarding our tissue services or products  or negative reviews from the fda or regulators of our processing and manufacturing facilities have decreased and may in the future decrease demand for our tissue services or products and could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition to the recall resulting from the fda order  we have in the past suspended and in the future may have to suspend the distribution of particular types of tissues as a result of reported adverse events in connection with our tissues 
suspension of the distribution of  or recall of  our tissue services or medical products could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 
we may receive a form notice of observations from the fda and we may be unable to address the concerns raised by the fda in such form the fda has issued form notices of observations in the past that have noted deficiencies in our operations  including process validation  complaint handling and reporting  and root cause analysis of certain testing results  among other items 
although we have had positive fda inspections recently  we could still be subject to an fda inspection that results in a form if the fda deems our responses to a form unsatisfactory  it could take further action  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the fda could institute additional recalls of products  require us to perform additional tests  begin to require prescriptions for products where they are not currently required  halt the shipping or processing of products  or require additional approvals for marketing our products or services 
synergraft processed pulmonary heart valves may not be accepted by the marketplace 
cryovalve sg may not perform as well as expected or provide all of the benefits anticipated by the marketplace and  as a result  the company may not be able to continue to process the majority of its pulmonary valves with its synergraft technology 
in that event  the company would need to return to processing some or all of its pulmonary heart valves without the synergraft technology  which could significantly reduce the expected benefits of the synergraft technology 
synergraft processed pulmonary heart valves must be shipped and implanted within one year or we will be required to discard them 
we are currently using the synergraft technology for the majority of our pulmonary heart valve processing pursuant to the k approval we have received for the synergraft treated valves 
our synergraft pulmonary heart valves must be discarded if they are not implanted within one year of being preserved  whereas our non synergraft processed pulmonary heart valves do not have to be discarded if not implanted within one year of cryopreservation 
accordingly  if we do not implant our synergraft pulmonary heart valves within one year of cryopreservation  we may lose more tissues than before we started processing pulmonary heart valves with the synergraft technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability  and cash flow 
our synergraft post clearance study may not provide expected results 
at the fda s request  we are planning a post clearance study to seek evidence for the potential and implied long term benefits of the synergraft process 
we expect the data to be collected to include long term safety and hemodynamic function  immune response  and explant analysis 
although we believe that this information may help us ascertain whether the synergraft process reduces the immune response of the transplanted heart valve and allows for the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s own cells  it is possible that the results of the study will not be as expected 
if this study shows that the synergraft process does not reduce immune response and or cause the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s cells  we may be unable to realize some or all of the benefits that we anticipated for the use of this process 
regulatory action outside of the us has affected our business in the past and may also affect our business in the future 
after the fda issued the fda order  discussed above  health canada also issued a recall on the same types of tissue 
in addition  other countries have made inquiries regarding the tissues that we export  although these inquiries are now  to our knowledge  complete 
in the event other countries raise additional regulatory concerns  we may be unable to export tissues to those countries 
revenue from international human tissue preservation services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also offer bioglue and other products for use in other countries 
our failure to adequately comply with government regulations could result in loss of revenues and customers as well as additional compliance expense 
the fda  certain international governments  and some states regulate the facilities and processes that we use 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda  state  and international regulatory authorities to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
certain of our facilities and processes are subject to international standards set by the international organization for standardization with respect to which our compliance is reviewed by our notified body 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we can be subject to sanctions  such as written observations of deficiencies made following inspections  warning letters  product recalls  fines  product seizures and consent decrees  all of which would be made available to the public 
such actions and publicity could affect our ability to sell our products and services 
in the past  the fda has sent us notifications and warning letters relating to deficiencies in our compliance with fda requirements 
we were required to take measures to respond 
we also were subject to the fda order  which decreased our revenues  increased our processing costs  and materially and adversely affected our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we cannot be certain that the fda  or state or international regulatory authorities will not request that we take additional steps to correct deficiencies that may be raised in the future 
correcting any such deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our business 
our existing insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our actual claims liability 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients using our products or tissues and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims 
following the fda order  product liability lawsuits increased to unprecedented numbers for us 
these claims involved assertions that infections and related morbidity  including death  were the result of inadequacies in our procedures 
we maintain claims made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
as of february   we know of two pending lawsuits against us arising out of our allograft heart valve and orthopaedic tissue services 
we believe that our product liability insurance covers these two lawsuits  and both lawsuits are in the pre discovery or discovery stages 
in addition other parties have made complaints against us that may result in lawsuits in future periods 
our december  consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability of approximately  for the estimated cost of resolving these claims 
the amounts recorded were estimates and do not reflect actual settlement arrangements or final judgments  the latter of which could include punitive damages  nor do they represent cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
this balance sheet also reflects a million liability which is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million for the estimated cost of resolving unreported product liability claims 
our product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies product liability claims for a description of our accounting treatment for product liability claims 
several putative class action lawsuits were filed in july through september against us and certain of our officers  alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  based on a series of purportedly materially false and misleading statements to the market 
on july  we reached an agreement in principle to settle the securities class action lawsuit and the settlement became final later in the year 
in august and january purported shareholder derivative actions were filed 
a settlement was also reached in those cases and became final in our insurance proceeds were insufficient to fund the costs of defending and settling the securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
if we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of current or future product liability  or future securities class action or derivative claims  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations 
additionally  if one or more claims  in which we are a defendant  whether now pending or hereafter arising  should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if we are unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding or any future claims  this will materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
further  if the costs of pending or unreported but incurred product liability claims exceed our current estimates  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not have sufficient resources to pay the claims against us  we may be forced to cease operations or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future  we may be subject to additional future exposure from product liability claims 
additionally  insurance rates may be significantly higher than in the past  and insurers may provide less coverage  which may adversely impact our profitability 
unlike the prior year s policy  the products liability policy did not cover any claims which arose prior to the insurance policy year 
our current products liability insurance policy is a five year claims made policy covering claims since the commencement of the policy year and expires in march we are currently evaluating with prospective insurers the available coverage and cost for products liability insurance 
it is possible that there could be increases in both cost and retention  although we expect the coverage to be a six year claims made policy 
we are also currently evaluating with prospective insurers available coverage and cost for director s and officer s insurance policies which expire in april we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining satisfactory coverage once our current coverage expires  which could adversely impact our liquidity if we suffer material uninsured claims liability 
intense competition may affect our ability to operate profitably 
we face competition from other companies engaged in the following lines of business the processing of human tissue  the marketing of mechanical valves and synthetic and animal tissue for implantation  and the marketing of surgical adhesives and surgical sealants 
management believes that at least two domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for allograft heart valves and many companies offer processed porcine heart valves and mechanical heart valves  including st 
jude medical  inc  medtronic  inc  and edwards life sciences 
our bioglue product competes with other surgical adhesives and surgical sealants  including baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal  ethicon s evicel  surgiflo  and surgifoam  and covidien s us surgical division s duraseal products 
we are also aware that a few companies have surgical adhesive products under development 
for example  johnson johnson is under fda review for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing that could compete with bioglue in certain applications 
other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies may also be developing competitive products 
our bioglue product competes on the basis of its high tensile strength and ease of use 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we do and are well established in their markets 
we have increased fees and prices on a number of our services and products since january  this increase may provide an opportunity for our competitors to gain market share 
if we are unable to continue to increase prices as planned and retain or improve our market share  our ability to grow revenues and profits may be adversely affected 
we cannot give assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully 
any products that we develop that gain regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share 
if we fail to compete effectively  this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome 
we may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development  and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance 
our growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon our ability to complete development of and successfully introduce new products and services  including new applications of our bioglue and related technology 
we are uncertain whether we can develop new products and services to a commercially acceptable form 
we must also expend much time and money to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
although we have conducted preclinical studies on certain products under development which indicate that such products may be effective in a particular application  we cannot be certain that the results we obtain from expanded clinical studies will be consistent with earlier trial results or be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances 
we cannot give assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully developing  introducing  and marketing new products 
we also cannot give assurance that the regulatory agencies will clear or approve these or any new products on a timely basis  if ever  or that the new products will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance 
our ability to complete the development of any of our products is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies 
such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems  manufacturing difficulties  and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully develop or manufacture our products which are under development 
if we do develop or manufacture these products  we may not do so on a timely basis 
these products may not meet price or performance objectives  and may not prove to be as effective as competing products 
if we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product  application  or service  or if we determine for financial  technical  or other reasons not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval of any product  application or service  particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital  this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive and we cannot be sure that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services 
even the successful commercialization of a new service or product in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing  under utilized production capacity  and continuing research and development and education costs 
the introduction of new products or services  which could include new products based on our protein hydrogel technology such as biofoam  and biodisc  and other products such as propatch  may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow up studies on human implant recipients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community 
investments in new technologies  and acquisitions of products or distribution rights may not be successful 
we may invest in new technology licenses  and acquire products or distribution rights that may not succeed in the marketplace 
in such cases  we may be unable to recover our initial investment  which could include acquiring license or distribution rights  acquiring products  or purchasing initial inventory 
inability to recover our initial investment may adversely impact our profitability 
if we are not successful in expanding our business activities in international markets  we will not be able to pursue one of our strategies for increasing our revenues 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the us  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries  adverse economic or political changes  more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  changes in our international distribution network and direct sales force  changes in currency exchange rates  potential trade restrictions  exchange controls  and import and export licensing requirements  and potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
our business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical personnel and senior management  many of whom would be difficult to replace  including our ceo  steven g 
anderson 
our business and future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  processing  technical  marketing  sales  and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel is intense and we cannot promise that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
we do not have key life insurance on any of our key personnel 
if we lose any key employees  if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately  or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  this could materially and adversely affect our ability to efficiently operate our business 
extensive government regulation may adversely affect our ability to develop and sell products and services 
government regulation in the us  the emea  and other jurisdictions can determine the success of our and our competitors efforts to market and develop services and products 
the fda  pursuant to rules it promulgated under the phs act  currently regulates allograft tissues as human tissue 
these rules establish requirements for donor testing and screening of human tissue and record keeping relating to these activities and impose certain registration and product listing requirements on establishments that process or distribute human tissue or cellular based products 
the fda has finalized and implemented good tissue practice regulations akin to good manufacturing practices  which must be followed by tissue banks and processors of human tissue 
these good tissue practice regulations will increase regulatory oversight of cryolife and other processors of human tissue 
although we and our competitors are endeavoring to satisfy the new regulations when they go into effect  there can be no assurance of success 
bioglue is regulated as a class iii medical device 
fixed porcine heart valve products are classified as class iii medical devices 
we may not obtain the fda approval required to distribute our porcine heart valve products in the us whether we are able to distribute these products within the eea will depend on whether we can maintain the ce mark for these products and their iso certifications  of which we cannot be certain 
most of our products and services in development and those of our competitors  if successfully developed  will require regulatory approvals from the fda and perhaps other regulatory authorities before they may be commercially distributed 
the process of obtaining premarket approvals from the fda normally involves clinical trials as well as an extensive premarket approval application and often takes many years 
in addition  the k approval process may also require clinical trials and take many years  for example the k approval for the cryovalve sg took a number of years 
the process for approval from the fda is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity  and novelty of the product 
we cannot give any assurance that any products developed by us or our competitors  independently or in collaboration with others  will receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining us or foreign approvals could result in substantial additional cost and adversely affect our competitive position 
the fda may also place conditions on product approvals that could restrict commercial applications of our products 
the fda may withdraw product marketing approvals or clearances if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays imposed by the governmental clearance process may materially reduce the period during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize patented products 
delays or rejections may also be encountered by us during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to satisfactorily demonstrate compliance with  or if the product fails to meet  the regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy  and quality 
those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in applicable laws  regulatory agency policies  or the adoption of new regulations 
clinical trials may also be delayed due to unanticipated side effects  inability to locate  recruit  and qualify sufficient numbers of patients  lack of funding  the inability to locate or recruit clinical investigators  the redesign of clinical trial programs  the inability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the particular product or any other components required for clinical trials  changes in development focus  and disclosure of trial results by competitors 
even if we or one of our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approval for any products or services offered  the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated usage for which such products or services may be marketed 
the unapproved use of our products or our preserved tissues could adversely affect the reputation of our products or services 
products or services marketed pursuant to fda or foreign oversight or approvals are subject to continuing regulation 
in the us  devices and biologics must be manufactured in registered establishments  and  in the case of biologics  licensed establishments and must be produced in accordance with quality system regulations 
manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic fda inspection 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the export of devices and biologics is also subject to regulation and may require fda approval 
from time to time  the fda may modify such regulations  imposing additional or different requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable fda requirements  which may be ambiguous  we could face civil and criminal enforcement actions  warnings  citations  product recalls or detentions  and other penalties 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  nota prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of human organs 
we cannot be certain that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future which will challenge one or more aspects of industry methods of charging for preservation services 
our laboratory operations and those of our competitors are subject to the us department of labor  occupational safety and health administration  and us environmental protection agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment 
some states have enacted statutes and regulations which govern the processing  transportation and storage of human organs and tissue 
us and foreign governments and regulatory agencies may adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology may adversely affect the value of our intellectual property 
we own several patents  patent applications  and licenses relating to our technologies  which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own 
we also cannot be certain that if anyone does make such a challenge  that we will be able to successfully defend that challenge 
we may have to incur substantial litigation costs to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies 
we cannot be sure that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or other rights owned by others 
we protect our proprietary technologies and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees  and consultants 
we cannot be sure that these entities and persons will not breach these agreements  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors 
if any of these events occur  they could result in our loss of the economic benefits associated with our key products and services and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
future health care reimbursement methods and policies may affect the availability  amount  and timing of our revenues 
even though we do not receive payments directly from third party health care payors  their reimbursement methods and policies impact demand for our preserved tissue and other services and products 
our preservation services with respect to the cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues may be particularly susceptible to third party cost containment measures 
for example  the initial cost of a preserved allograft heart valve generally exceeds the cost of a mechanical  synthetic  or animal derived valve 
we are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods and policies utilized by third party health care payors or their effect on us 
if third party health care payors  including medicare  change their reimbursement methods and policies with respect to preserved tissues provided for implant by us and other services and products that we offer  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products and services  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new products 
if government mandated health insurance is adopted  the demand for and prices obtained for our products could be negatively impacted because government mandated health insurance could result in higher cost surgeries not being approved or could limit the level of reimbursement for new products  such as cryovalve sg 
government  hospitals  and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these entities refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for uses of our new products and services  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected  which could negatively impact revenue growth and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
the technologies underlying our products and services are subject to rapid and profound technological change 
competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known 
we can give no assurance that others will not develop products or processes with significant advantages over the products and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop 
any such occurrence could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risks related to our capital stock trading prices for our securities have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and may continue to be volatile in the future 
trading price fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors  including variations in operating results  regulatory actions such as the adverse fda activity  product liability claims  announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory acts  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the medical device or service industries  actions taken by government regulators  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our revenues or operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
changes in the trading price of our common stock may bear no relation to our actual operational or financial results 
if our share prices do not meet the requirements of the new york stock exchange  our shares may be delisted 
our closing common stock price in the period january  to february  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation 
moreover  market prices for stocks of biotechnology related and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices generally are not sustainable and are highly volatile 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources  and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
anti takeover provisions may discourage or make more difficult an attempt to obtain control of cryolife 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or make more difficult any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of our company  including provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  restricting the persons who may call a special meeting of the shareholders  and prohibiting shareholders from taking action by written consent 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of florida law that may discourage or make more difficult takeover attempts or acquisitions of substantial amounts of our common stock 
further  pursuant to the terms of a shareholder rights plan adopted in and amended in  each outstanding share of common stock has one attached right 
the rights will cause substantial dilution of the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors and may deter hostile takeover attempts 
these provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our stock at above market prices 
we are not likely to pay common stock dividends in the foreseeable future  and we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock due to legal restrictions and lack of liquidity 
we have not paid  and do not presently intend to pay  cash dividends on our common stock 
in addition  under florida law and under the restrictions set forth in our credit agreement  we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock 
under florida law  no distribution may be paid on our capital stock  if after giving it effect we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any preferred shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
the terms of any future financing arrangements that we may enter into may also restrict our ability to pay dividends

overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated january  in florida  develops and commercializes biomaterials and implantable medical devices  and preserves and distributes human tissues for cardiac and vascular transplant applications 
the company s biomaterials and implantable medical devices include bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue  cryolife o brien stentless porcine aortic bioprosthesis  and propatch soft tissue repair matrix propatch 
additionally  the company distributes cardiowrap for mast biosurgery  inc mast 
for cryolife the year ended december  featured a return to profitability as the company reported net income and positive cash flows from operations for four straight quarters 
this profitability was driven by strong revenue growth as total revenues increased in as compared to see the results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during recent events synergraft processed human pulmonary heart valve k clearance on february  cryolife received k clearance from the food and drug administration fda for its cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve processed with the company s proprietary synergraft technology 
cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology is designed to remove donor cells and cellular remnants from the valve without compromising the integrity of the underlying collagen matrix 
the cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve is indicated for the replacement of diseased  damaged  malformed  or malfunctioning native pulmonary valves 
the valve can be used in conjunction with right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction procedures rvot  commonly performed in children with congenital heart defects 
in addition  the valve can be used for pulmonary valve replacement during the ross procedure  an operation in which a patient s defective aortic valve is removed and replaced with his own pulmonary valve 
the cryovalve sg is then surgically implanted in place of the removed native pulmonary valve 
at the fda s request  cryolife is planning a post clearance study to seek evidence for the potential and implied long term benefits of the synergraft process 
data to be collected is expected to include long term safety and hemodynamic function  immune response  and explant analysis 
cryolife believes that this information may help it ascertain whether the synergraft process reduces the immune response of the transplanted heart valve and allows for the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s own cells 
cryolife has begun using the synergraft technology for the majority of its pulmonary valve processing and anticipates that the first cryovalve sg may be available for shipment late in the first quarter of trophic solutions license agreement on january  cryolife announced that it had signed an exclusive license agreement with trophic solutions  llc trophic to develop and market products related to the cold storage and preservation of internal organs prior to transport 
under terms of the agreement  the company will license from trophic the right to develop  manufacture  and market products and processes derived from a patent owned by trophic  which relates to solutions containing purified antimicrobial polypeptides and or cell surface receptor binding proteins for use in the storage and preservation of internal organs prior to transplant 
in early animal and human studies  the trophic technology has shown that kidneys may be stored for up to six days prior to transplant without compromising graft function rather than three days using present technology 
these studies also indicate that the solution may reduce or eliminate the need for pumping kidneys  which may reduce the cost of maintaining and transporting kidneys for transplant 
the agreement gives cryolife the exclusive right to determine if a commercial product can be developed using the process covered by the patent for a period of one year  which may be extended for an additional ninety days 
critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company  the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
as of february  two product liability lawsuits were pending against the company arising out of the company s allograft heart valve and orthopaedic tissue services 
these lawsuits are covered by product liability insurance and are in the pre discovery or discovery stages 
other parties have made complaints that may result in lawsuits in future periods 
the company performed an analysis as of december  of the pending product liability lawsuit and other claims based on settlement negotiations to date and advice from counsel 
as of december  the company had accrued approximately  for the pending product liability lawsuits 
the  accrual was included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of approximately  for a pending product liability lawsuit 
the lawsuit to which this accrual related was settled in the first quarter of the  accrual was included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
on april  the company bound coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is a five year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products used 
in january the company retained an independent actuarial firm to perform estimates of the unreported claims as of december  the independent firm estimated the unreported product loss liability using a frequency severity approach  whereby projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the independent actuarial firm used a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported product loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of unreported claims for accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that these assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the calculation of the unreported product liability loss  but accuracy of the actuarial firm s estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
based on the actuarial valuation performed in january as of december   the company estimated that its liability for unreported product liability claims was million as of december  the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
further analysis indicated that the liability could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations calculated based on actuarial simulation techniques 
based on the actuarial valuation  the company estimated that as of december   million of the accrual for unreported liability claims would be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
the million insurance recoverable is included as a component of other receivables of million and other long term assets of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
these amounts represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  actual results may differ from this estimate 
as of december  the company accrued million for unreported product liability claims and recorded a receivable of million for unreported liability claims estimated to be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
this million accrual was included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the million insurance recoverable was included as a component of other current receivables of million and other long term assets of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold 
therefore  the tissues the company preserves and further processes cannot be held as inventory 
tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement agencies  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing activities and facility allocations 
although the company cannot own human tissue  the preservation process is a manufacturing process that is accounted for in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
arb chapter  inventory pricing 
preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to the implanting facilities 
cost of preservation services also includes idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities in accordance with sfas no 
inventory costs sfas 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs includes a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent procurement agencies  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could materially impact the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the cost of preservation services  including the lower of cost or market write down  described below  on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value and to determine if there are any impairments to the book value of the company s deferred preservation costs 
cryolife records a charge to cost of preservation services to write down the amount of deferred preservation costs that are not deemed to be recoverable 
these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels when tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company recorded write downs of  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  for the value of certain deferred preservation costs that exceeded market value 
the amount of these write downs are primarily due to excess current period tissue processing costs that exceeded market value based on recent average service fees 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company also recorded write downs of  for the year ended december  due to the impairment of certain vascular and orthopaedic tissues 
the company also recorded write downs of  for the year ended december  due to the impairment of certain orthopaedic tissues 
the tissues were impaired in the period the company determined that the tissues were not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the tissues packaging 
the company also recorded a write down of million in the year ended december  due to the impairment of certain orthopaedic tissues and processing materials as a result of the exchange and service agreement with regeneration technologies  inc  and certain of its affiliates the rti agreement discussed in part ii  item  note of the notes to summary consolidated financial statements 
this write down was based on the company s estimate of the tissues that would be shipped during the month period subsequent to december  in which the company can continue to distribute its orthopaedic tissues 
the amount of tissues shipped during that period could differ significantly from this initial estimate resulting in higher margins on shipments of orthopaedic tissues during the month period or additional write downs in future periods 
cost of preservation services was favorably affected during the year ended december  by shipments of orthopaedic tissue with a zero cost basis for which revenues were recognized but costs  estimated to be  had already been written down in previous periods 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for allograft heart valve tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and  for orthopaedic tissues 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for allograft heart valve tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and million for orthopaedic tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated deferred tax assets primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for product liability claims  and operating losses 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets at december   the company reviewed its historical operating results  including the reasons for its operating losses in prior years and uncertainties regarding projected future operating results 
based on the results of this analysis  discussed further below  at december  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would not be realized 
based on the company s results for the year ended december   and its projections for  the company anticipates that it will utilize a portion of its net operating loss carryforwards in the income tax year to offset its us taxable income  as it did in the and tax years 
although cryolife is beginning to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards  the company currently believes that a change in its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets is not yet warranted 
cryolife will continue to evaluate its determination in accordance with the guidance in sfas  which indicates the company s net losses in recent years constitute significant evidence against the recoverability of its deferred tax assets that is difficult to overcome 
cryolife will reverse the remaining valuation allowance  or a portion thereof  when and if its deferred tax assets meet the sfas more likely than not standard for recognition 
also  the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets could be limited in future periods following a change in control as mandated by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax liability of  as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax liability of  related to taxes in a foreign jurisdiction 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  or significant decline in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires the write down of a long lived asset to be held and used if the carrying value of the asset or the asset group to which the asset belongs is not recoverable 
the carrying value of the asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
for the year ended december  the company did not experience any factors that indicated an sfas impairment review was warranted 
for the years ended december  and  the company performed an sfas impairment analysis  due to a variety of triggering factors including its operating performance 
in these periods the undiscounted future cash flows of the company s asset groups exceeded their carrying values 
therefore  management concluded that there was not an impairment of the company s long lived tangible and amortizing intangible assets 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill resulting from business acquisitions and other non amortizing intangible assets be subject to annual impairment testing 
the company s non amortizing intangible assets as of december  consist of trademarks and  as a result of the rti agreement  procurement contracts and access to the procurement of cardiac and vascular human tissues previously received by rti 
in accordance with sfas  the company performed an analysis on its non amortizing intangible assets as of december  based on the results of its analysis  the company does not believe that an impairment existed related to its non amortizing intangible assets as of december  management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these non amortizing intangible assets on an annual basis in accordance with sfas new accounting pronouncements in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised business combinations sfas r 
sfas r revises the accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on its results of operations and financial position 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas for the fiscal year beginning january  sfas provides a single definition of fair value and a hierarchical framework for measuring it  as well as establishing additional disclosure requirements about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material affect on its results of operations or financial position 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas for the fiscal year beginning january  sfas provides the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the intent to mitigate volatility in financial reporting that can occur when related assets and liabilities are measured differently 
the company does not expect to voluntarily implement the optional fair value measurements portions of sfas for eligible items 
therefore  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material affect on its results of operations or financial position 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues revenues increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues and bioglue revenues  partially offset by a decrease in orthopaedic preservation services revenues as compared to the prior year periods 
a detailed discussion of the change in preservation services revenues for each of the three major tissue types distributed by the company and the change in bioglue revenues is presented below 
cardiac preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues cardiac revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues  which increased revenues by  an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by  and favorable foreign exchange  which increased revenues by 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues  which increased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in cardiac volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to increased shipments of all of the cardiac tissues processed by the company 
the increases in cardiac shipments were a result of increased availability of tissues due to improvements in the procurement of cardiac tissues and due to strengthening demand for the company s tissues 
the increase in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to fee increases that went into effect in january and july  particularly the increases related to non valved conduits  and due to the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the company s procurement of cardiac tissues  from which heart valves and non valved cardiac tissues are processed  increased for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  the increase in cardiac tissue procurement in over the prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the share of the donated tissue supply received by cryolife in comparison to all other cardiac tissue processors  which was due in part to the rti agreement 
as discussed in part ii  item  note of the notes to summary consolidated financial statements  on february  the company obtained fda clearance of its k premarket notification for the cryovalve sg 
therefore  the company could experience an increase in its cardiac preservation services revenues as a result of shipments of the cryovalve sg  which are expected to have a premium fee over the standard processed cryovalve 
however  there are no guarantees that the cryovalve sg will demand premium fees or that shipments of the cryovalve sg will occur at material levels 
vascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues vascular revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in vascular volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins 
the increases in vascular shipments were primarily due to strong demand for the company s tissues  primarily demand for saphenous veins for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations  and strong procurement of vascular tissues in recent periods 
the increase in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to fee increases that went into effect in january and the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the company s procurement of vascular tissues increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  and increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in vascular tissue procurement in over the prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the share of the donated tissue supply received by cryolife in comparison to all other vascular tissue processors  which was due in part to the rti agreement 
orthopaedic preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues orthopaedic revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from orthopaedic preservation services decreased and for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the decrease in revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to decreases in unit shipments of orthopaedic tissues  as a result of the limited supply of orthopaedic tissues available for shipment  resulting from the company s cessation of procuring and processing these tissues on january  in accordance with the rti agreement and  to a lesser extent  due to declining demand for the company s orthopaedic tissues  as the company is no longer actively marketing its orthopaedic preservation services 
although cryolife will continue to ship its existing orthopaedic tissues  pursuant to the rti agreement  through june   the company anticipates that orthopaedic service revenues for the first half of will decrease significantly compared to the same period in due to the limited tissues available for shipment as the higher demand orthopaedic tissues and sizes are exhausted from the company s tissue inventories  and due to the transition of the company s orthopaedic tissue customers to alternative suppliers 
in accordance with the rti agreement  rti is entitled to market and solicit orders for cryolife s remaining orthopaedic tissue inventory subsequent to june  if cryolife ships any orthopaedic tissues at rti s direction  cryolife will recognize orthopaedic preservation services revenue and pay a corresponding commission to rti 
cryolife does not currently anticipate that it will recognize material revenues from the shipment of orthopaedic tissues subsequent to june  bioglue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues bioglue revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average prices  which increased revenues by  a increase in the number of milliliters of bioglue shipped  which increased revenues by  and the favorable effect of foreign exchange  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average prices  which increased revenues by  a increase in the number of milliliters of bioglue shipped  which increased revenues by  and the favorable effect of foreign exchange  which increased revenues by 
the increase in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to price increases that went into effect in january and july  domestically and in certain international markets  and the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and of total bioglue revenues for both the three and twelve months ended december  other revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  grant and licensing revenues grant and licensing revenues as a percentage of total revenue grant and licensing revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  and included revenues for research grants and revenues related to the licensing of the company s technology to a third party 
in cryolife was awarded  in funding allocated from the us congress defense appropriations conference report the dod grant in connection with the development of biofoam 
grant revenues in and are related to funding under this grant 
in cryolife was awarded million in funding allocated from the defense appropriations conference report  the dod grant in connection with further development of biofoam 
the defense appropriations conference report the dod grant included approximately million for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology for use on the battlefield 
cryolife applied for funding under this bill during the company does not currently know if and when it will be approved to receive funding under the dod grant or receive the final funding awarded under the dod grant 
through december  cryolife had received a total of million in advances on these grants and approximately million in advances are yet to be received 
as of december  cryolife had million in unspent cash advances under the grants recorded as cash and deferred revenues on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company anticipates that grant revenues could increase in over related to spending on biofoam research 
costs and expenses cost of preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of preservation services cost of preservation services as a percentage of total preservation services revenue cost of preservation services for the three and twelve months ended december  included the write down of  and  respectively  of certain deferred preservation costs that exceeded market value 
cost of preservation services for the three and twelve months ended december  included the write down of  and million  respectively  of certain deferred preservation costs that exceeded market value 
the write down of deferred preservation costs that exceeded market value in both years was primarily related to the company s non valved cardiac tissues 
the company implemented fee increases in july and january  in part to address these tissues  which have had costs in excess of the average service fees 
the decrease of the write down in the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods is primarily due to the favorable effect of the fee increases 
cost of preservation services for the twelve months ended december  included a write down of  due to the impairment of certain vascular and orthopaedic tissues 
cost of preservation services for the twelve months ended december  included the write down of  due to the impairment of certain orthopaedic tissues 
the tissues were considered impaired in the period in which the company determined that the tissues were not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the tissue s packaging 
cost of preservation services for the three and twelve months ended december  includes the write down of million due to the impairment of certain orthopaedic tissues and processing materials as a result of the rti agreement 
cost of preservation services was favorably affected for the three and twelve months ended december  by shipments of orthopaedic tissue with a zero cost basis for which revenues were recognized but costs  estimated to be  and  respectively  had already been written down in previous periods 
cost of preservation services for the three and twelve months ended december  decreased primarily due to the net favorable effect of the decrease in write downs in as compared to as discussed above  partially offset by an increase in the costs resulting from an increase in preservation services volume as compared to the prior year 
cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  decreased primarily due to the net favorable effect of the decrease in the write downs in as compared to  as discussed above  and improvements in preservation service margins 
preservation service margins were favorably impacted by increases in average service fees and a favorable mix shift as the less profitable orthopaedic tissues made up a lower percentage of the company s tissue shipments 
the company anticipates that cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues in may be favorably impacted by shipments of the cryovalve sg  as cryovalve sg are expected to have a premium fee over the standard processed cryovalve 
cost of products three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of products cost of products as a percentage of total product revenue the decrease in cost of products for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in the sales volume of other implantable medical devices  partially offset by an increase in bioglue sales volume 
the decrease in cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to favorable product mix 
the company experienced favorable product mix as sales of lower margin implantable medical devices made up a smaller percentage of total products sold in as compared to general  administrative  and marketing expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  general  administrative  and marketing expenses cost of general  administrative  and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three months ended december  included a charge for stock based compensation expenses of approximately  general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three months ended december  included a charge of  for stock based compensation expenses  and a favorable adjustment of  to unreported product liability accruals 
the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in marketing literature  advertising  and personnel costs to support revenue growth and the net unfavorable effect of the change in non cash charges discussed above partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  included charges of approximately million for stock based compensation expenses and  for post retirement benefits 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  included a favorable adjustment of million related to the settlement of an insurance coverage dispute with an insurance company  net of associated legal fees  a favorable adjustment of  to reserves for product liability losses  a charge of million for stock based compensation expenses  and an accrual of  for post employment benefits 
the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the net unfavorable effect of the change in the items discussed above  an increase in marketing literature  advertising  and personnel costs to support revenue growth  and an increase in compensation costs for management and administrative employees  partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs 
gain on exit activities three months ended december  twelve months ended december  gain on exit activities gain on exit activities as a percentage of total revenue gain on exit activities in the three and twelve months ended december  represents the gain associated with the rti agreement 
the gain is primarily due to a gain on the recording of intangible assets received from rti  partially offset by several individually immaterial asset write downs and expense accruals incurred as a result of the transaction 
the intangibles acquired from rti in the transaction include procurement contracts and access to the procurement of cardiac and vascular human tissues previously received by rti  customer lists  and a non compete agreement 
this gain was offset by losses due to the impairment of certain orthopaedic tissues and processing materials resulting from the rti agreement which have been recorded as part of cost of human tissue preservation services as discussed above 
the gain on exit activities and the write down in cost of human tissue preservation services net to an overall loss of  related to the transaction in see part ii
