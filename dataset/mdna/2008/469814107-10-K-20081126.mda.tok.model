table of contents business strategy general there are four major components of our business strategy safety  a relationship based approach to client interactions  a strong focus on cost control  and an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution 
acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones 
acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 
safety key to the success of our business strategy is our uncompromising focus on safety 
providing an injury and incident free work environment is an unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees and subcontractors 
it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients  and our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management 
a safe work environment is critical to our long term success and growth 
we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes 
unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover  increase the cost of a project to our clients  expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable  and increase our own operating costs as well 
safe job sites and office environments  on the other hand  benefit our clients  promote employee morale  and enhance the long term relationships we have with our clients  employees  and business partners 
relationship based business model our relationship based business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability 
we aggressively pursue the development of long term affiliations and alliances with our clients 
by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs  we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects 
this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide a superior value to our clients 
we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise 
by integrating and bundling our services ie  providing design  engineering  and construction services on the same project  we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients 
our relationship based business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects  which in turn allows us to better manage those risks 
our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post start up and commissioning phases of a plant  such as operations and maintenance services 
this model  however  does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not conflict with our business strategy 
we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 
closely linked to our relationship based business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world 
this strategy requires us to act and operate as a local contractor in every geographic area of the world in which we do business 
we believe it is important for us as a company to be local with respect to our network of offices and operations 
because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work  we re able to support our multinational clients with their cross border capital projects 
our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world 
our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we win large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group 

table of contents cost control our continual emphasis on cost control is an important component of our business strategy 
as the global economy expands and companies providing technical  professional  and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries  the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage 
our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical  professional  and construction services safely  efficiently  and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 
organizational structure our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy 
our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering  design  and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute long term engineering and construction contracts 
crucial functions  such as project controls and procurement  are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects 
in addition  we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients 
we do not maintain profit centers within the company  nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts 
instead  our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 
the role of acquisitions in our business strategy our relationship based business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy 
when we review potential acquisition targets  we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base 
we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients  and or gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand 
by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities  we strive to position ourselves as a preferred  single source provider of technical  professional  and construction services to our major clients 
the following is a brief description of some of our key acquisitions over the past five years in november  we acquired carter burgess  inc carter burgess 
headquartered in fort worth  texas  carter burgess was an approximately  person professional services firm providing architecture  engineering  design  and planning services to public and private sector clients operating in the fields of transportation  water  infrastructure programs  building programs  land development  and planning 
the primary purpose for acquiring carter burgess was to expand our infrastructure and facilities business in the us in march we acquired a interest in zamel turbag consulting engineers zate 
located in saudi arabia  zate was an approximately person professional services firm providing engineering and construction management services to clients operating in the oil gas  refining  and chemicals industries 
the primary purpose for acquiring zate was to expand our business in the middle east with clients operating in those industries in the middle east 
in april  we acquired edwards and kelcey  inc edwards and kelcey 
edwards and kelcey was a nationally recognized engineering  design  planning  and construction management firm serving public and private clients in the fields of transportation  planning environmental  communications technology  buildings facilities  and land development 
headquartered in morristown  new jersey  edwards and kelcey employed approximately  people in offices located primarily in the northeastern region of the united states us the primary purpose for acquiring edwards and kelcey was to expand our infrastructure business in the us in august  we acquired the babtie group limited babtie group 
the babtie group was a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure  facilities  environmental  defense  and governmental outsourcing markets  among others 
headquartered in 
table of contents glasgow  scotland  the babtie group employed approximately  people in offices located throughout the united kingdom uk and asia  with smaller operations in india and the czech republic 
the primary purpose for acquiring the babtie group was to expand our infrastructure and facilities business in the uk in any particular year  we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise 
services provided as described above  the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services  process  scientific  and systems consulting services  construction services  and operations and maintenance services 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  range from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years ended september in thousands of dollars project services process  scientific and systems consulting construction operations and maintenance project services we employ all of the engineering  design  architectural  and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  oil gas  refining  food and consumer products  and basic resources industries  buildings including facilities for clients in the health care  education  and criminal justice markets  as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector  infrastructure projects including highways  roads  bridges  and other transportation systems  water and wastewater treatment plants  water resources facilities  and other similar plants and facilities  technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace  automotive  defense  semiconductor  and electronics industries  consumer products manufacturing facilities  pulp and paper plants  and other facilities 
we also employ many of the requisite scientific  technical  and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration  testing  and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries  for the us department of defense dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers  for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for aerospace  testing  and propulsion systems and facilities  and for various agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 
we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design 
through safety in design we integrate best practices  hazard analysis  and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects  taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction  start up  testing and commissioning  and operations phases of a project 
in the area of construction management  we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients 
we may act as the program director  whereby we oversee  on the owner s behalf  the complete planning  design  and construction phases of the project 
alternatively  our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

table of contents also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning  scheduling  procurement  estimating  cost engineering  project accounting  and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering  design  construction  construction and program management  operations and maintenance  and consulting services 
process  scientific and systems consulting we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies  market analyses  and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project  performing gasoline reformulation modeling  analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants  analyzing automation and control systems  analyzing  designing  and executing biocontainment strategies  developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administration mandated qualification and validation requirements  providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects  and performing geological and metallurgical studies 
also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs 
such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide  and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems  weapons modeling and simulations  computer systems development  maintenance  and support  evaluation and testing of mission critical control systems  and other highly technical programs and tasks 
construction we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services 
in the area of environmental remediation and restoration  we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 
we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology 
our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design  off site fabrication and assembly  and field erection 
it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction  which can compress and shorten the construction schedule  reduce risk  and lower costs 
historically  our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work 
by focusing our construction efforts on such projects  we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties 
the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixed price contracts  therefore  we generally avoid this type of project 
however  we will pursue construction only projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which results in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 
operations and maintenance o m o m generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large  complex facilities on behalf of clients 
we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility  including managing subcontractors and other on site personnel 
within the environmental area  o m often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 
within the aerospace and defense areas  o m often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities  weapons integration  and high tech simulation and verification centers 
such o m contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services  utilities operations and maintenance services  property management and disposition services  and construction support services 

table of contents o m also includes process plant maintenance services  which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in day to day operation 
such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps  piping  heat exchangers  and other equipment as well as turnaround work  which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down 
since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant  turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a hours per day  seven days per week basis 
we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly  and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 
although the gross profit margins that we realize from o m services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide  the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower 
furthermore  we view o m contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to us as compared to some of the other services we provide because o m contracts are normally cost reimbursable in nature 
additionally  although engineering and construction projects may be of a short term nature  o m services often result in long term relationships with clients 
for example  we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades 
this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 
financial information about segments although we describe our business in this annual report on form k in terms of the services we provide  the markets in which our clients operate  and the geographic areas in which we operate  we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the us financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
in making this determination  we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide  our internal processes for delivering those services  and the types of customers we have 
in addition to the discussion that follows  please refer to note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories 
for example  engineering and design services ie  services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed  such as engineers  architects  scientists  and economists exist in all four service categories 
in addition  there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and o m projects 
in providing construction and o m services  we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel 
these may include welders  pipe fitters  electricians  crane operators  and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the o m services category 
our operating units use a matrix organizational structure 
our results  therefore  are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg  electrical engineering  mechanical engineering  cost engineering  etc 
supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients  and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely  on time  and on budget 
additionally  all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools  policies  and procedures to manage and run their respective units 
these include project review meetings  project performance evaluations  and project execution plans 
the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform 
whether it is pc based computer aided design and drafting cadd applications used by our engineering and design staff  or pc based modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff  or pc based scheduling  estimating  and cost control applications used by home office personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities  all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

table of contents furthermore  the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance  evaluate results of operations  allocate resources  and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment 
accordingly  based on these similarities  we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosure included in this annual report on form k 
industry groups and markets we provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets energy and refining downstream  long term programs for various national governments  including the us  chemicals and polymers  oil and gas upstream  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  infrastructure  buildings  and other  general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and mining and minerals

backlog for information regarding our backlog  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
significant customers the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years ended september it is rare for a commercial customer to contribute or more of the company s total revenue 
on occasion  however  we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which  primarily because of the amount of pass through costs discussed below that is included in revenue  will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed of total consolidated revenues 
for the fiscal year ended september  revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for of total consolidated revenues 
financial information about geographic areas selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
in such situations  our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years ended september in thousands of dollars cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both lump sum bid contracts and negotiated fixed price contracts 
under lump sum bid contracts  we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
additionally  it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
accordingly  lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services  rather than turn key construction 

table of contents guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model

item a 
risk factors construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces 
if we fail to maintain safe work sites  we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 
construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment  moving vehicles  chemical and manufacturing processes  and highly regulated materials 
on many sites we are responsible for safety and  accordingly  must implement safety procedures 
if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  our employees and others may become injured 
this could result in financial losses  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials  which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health  safety  and environmental hse work procedures throughout our organization  including construction sites and maintenance sites  the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 
our safety record is critical to our reputation 
many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures 
as a result  our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents negative conditions in the credit markets could impair our ability to operate our business and implement our acquisition strategy although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations  we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions 
in addition  from time to time our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects 
due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad  the availability of credit has continued to tighten in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us 
this situation may inhibit our growth and could negatively impact our clients ability to fund their projects  resulting in our loss of revenues 
we routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors  suppliers  and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by recent events in the credit markets 
if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients  we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  which could impact our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are  therefore  subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices 
in weak economic environments  we may experience increased delays and failures due to  among other reasons  a diminution in our clients access to the credit markets 
if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables  it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations  and financial condition 
additional discussion of some of the risks associated with the current economic downturn can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel  including engineers  architects  designers  craft personnel  and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise 
there is intense demand for these employees 
in certain geographic areas  for example  we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified craft personnel 
in addition  as some of our key personnel approach retirement age  we also need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors  and vendors presenting claims to us for  among other things  recovery of costs related to certain projects 
similarly  we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients  subcontractors  and vendors 
if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we could incur cost overruns and reduced profits 
additionally  irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders  the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 
in many of our contracts with clients  subcontractors  and vendors  we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages  penalties  losses  and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts and that could  if significant enough  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are also subject to claims for not fulfilling guarantees relating to  among other things  project schedules  and plant performance 

table of contents in addition  we become a party to litigation in the normal course of business 
most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and similar matters 
such lawsuits may relate to current or completed projects and may be brought by our clients as well as those who use or reside near our clients projects 
if a lawsuit is determined contrary to our interests  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums 
in addition  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under these programs 
as a result  we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
our insurers are subject to business risk 
one or more of our insurers may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 
to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted  which impact could be material 
our business is vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate and dependent on the timing and funding of new awards 
we provide technical  professional  and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration  production  and refining  programs for various national governments  including the us federal government  chemicals and polymers  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  infrastructure  buildings  and other  general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and mining and minerals 
these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been  and we expect will continue to be  cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control  including economic conditions and changes in client spending 
during economic slowdowns  many of our clients may face considerable budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending  which may decrease the overall demand for our services 
for example  a decrease in state tax revenue as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending 
our clients may also find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the municipal and general credit markets 
in addition  our clients may also demand better pricing terms and their ability to pay our invoices in a timely manner may be affected by an increasingly weakened economy 
our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and  therefore  may not recover as quickly as the economy at large 
if the economy weakens further or government spending is reduced  then our revenues  net income and overall financial condition may deteriorate 
regardless of economic or market conditions  investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost 
because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards  we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients markets and investment decisions 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer s investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation  delays in existing work  or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 
commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways 
some of our customers produce commodity products such as fertilizers  oil and gas  or copper 
fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on our customers profitability and cash flow and  therefore  their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments 
commodity prices also strongly affect the costs of projects 
rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned  as well as those in progress 
as a result of either or both of these factors  our customers may defer new investment or cancel or delay existing projects 
cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways 

table of contents contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 
contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions  and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding 
contracts with the us federal government  for example  are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding 
governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 
as a result  our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice 
since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues those with the us federal government represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
for example  for contracts with the us federal government  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards  the service contract act  and dod security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping  and accounting 
government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non government contracts 
this includes  for example  unlimited indemnification obligations 
we also are subject to government audits  investigations  and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws 
for example  government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations 
if we violate a rule or regulation  fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit  a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties 
in addition  our government contracts could be terminated  we could be suspended or debarred from government contract work  or payment of our costs could be disallowed 
any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixed price or guaranteed maximum price in nature 
for such contracts  we bear the risk of paying some  if not all  of any cost overruns 
under fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions  including those about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications  or if circumstances change due to  among other things  unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors or subcontractors inability to perform  then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
if the project is significant  or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects  costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted  cancelled or suspended by our clients 
additionally  even if fully performed  our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 
at september   our backlog totaled approximately billion 
projects can remain in backlog for an extended time 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  termination or suspension at the discretion of the client 
in addition  the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts 
the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of wide spread economic slowdowns 
accordingly  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or  if realized  will result in profits 
in addition  the gross margins ie  contract revenue less direct costs of contracts we realize can vary considerably between contracts 
one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on gross margins is the amount of pass through costs incurred 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
since pass through costs typically do not bring significant margins with them  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins 
additionally  the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence  future profitability 
in some markets  there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
typically  our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs  overall safety performance  overall client satisfaction  and other performance criteria 
if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards  we may receive a lower  or even zero  incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog  assuming they produce the revenues currently expected  will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 
our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control 
as is common in the industry  we participate in projects by entering into joint ventures  partnerships  and similar arrangements 
this situation exposes us to a number of risks  including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 
our partners may also be unable to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships 
if these circumstances occur  we may be required to provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients  which could impact our reputation  business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner 
in these cases  we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture 
to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 
much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third party subcontractors we hire 
we also rely on third party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects 
if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers  our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay 
table of contents for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated  especially in a lump sum or a fixed price contract  we may suffer losses on these contracts 
if a subcontractor  supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services  supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason  we may be required to source these services  equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated  which could impact contract profitability 
in the current economic environment  third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations 
the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party s ability to provide materials  equipment or services which could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixed price contracts 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
we have bonding capacity but  as is typically the case  the issuance of a bond is at the surety s sole discretion 
moreover  due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally  bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
if we fail to comply with federal  state  local or foreign governmental requirements  our business may be adversely affected 
we are subject to us federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business 
for example  we are subject to a variety of environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations governing  among other things  discharges to air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety 
these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost 
violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 
various us federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities 
these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants 
the liability under these laws is joint and several 
we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties 
the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean up obligations at these or other sites could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
when we perform our services  our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions 
we may be subject to liability claims by employees  customers and third parties as a result of such exposures 
in addition  we may be subject to fines  penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws 
a claim  if not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
such laws  regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  for example  relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment  which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and  in turn  could 
table of contents negatively impact our revenue 
our failure to comply with such laws or regulations  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments  which may require us or our clients to obtain  and to comply with  federal  state and local government permits and approvals 
any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial  revocation or modification under various circumstances 
failure to obtain or comply with  or the loss or modification of  the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities  which can adversely affect our business  financial condition or result of operations 
employee  agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts  which could result in reduced revenues and profits 
misconduct  fraud  non compliance with applicable laws and regulations  or other improper activities by one of our employees  agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation 
such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations  regulations regarding the protection of classified information  regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices  regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts  regulations on lobbying or similar activities  regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting  environmental laws  and any other applicable laws or regulations 
for example  we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters  if a security breach were to occur  our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited 
the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective  and we could face unknown risks or losses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties  loss of security clearance  and suspension or debarment from contracting  which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance  if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us 
a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our significant clients  our clients may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts at any time 
our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents we engage in a highly competitive business 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition to provide technical  professional  and construction services to clients 
the extent of such competition varies by industry  geographic market  and project type 
for example  with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services  clients generally award large projects to large contractors  which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects 
conversely  with respect to our engineering  design  architectural  and consulting services  low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller  newer competitors 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both  which if significant  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our larger competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel  fluor  foster wheeler ltd  urs  kbr  aker kvaerner  technip  worleyparsons  and amec 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  hellmuth  obata kassabaum  aecom technology  and turner construction 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff  hntb  tetra tech  parsons  and ws atkins 
in the area of us federal programs  our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as the shaw group  saic  chm hill  weston solutions  lockheed martin corporation  and computer sciences corporation 
and in the area of pulp and paper  our principal competitors include kbr and amec 
in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors  our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations  and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
at a minimum  our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
in addition  our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements  the adoption of new  and the expansion of existing  trade restrictions  embargoes  acts of war and terrorism  the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations  social  political  and economic instability  tax increases  limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings  and us government policies 
to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic  political and other conditions  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition  our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders 
although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws  the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines  or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges  and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our business strategy involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
acquiring companies present a number of risks  including difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a combined  integrated  and efficient business  the effects of diverting management s attention from day to day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies  assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services  and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities  and difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in addition  the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions 
acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make  we could dilute share ownership 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
accordingly  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s on december  if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise  such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages in the company 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  including fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers  the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter  unanticipated changes in contract performance  particularly with contracts that have funding limits  
table of contents the timing of resolving change orders  requests for equitable adjustments  and other contract adjustments  delays incurred in connection with a project  weather conditions that delay work at project sites  the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives  natural disasters or other crises  such as the hurricanes affecting oil producing regions like the gulf of mexico  staff levels and utilization rates  changes in prices of services offered by our competitors  and general economic and political conditions 
fluctuations in quarterly results could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 
our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  our management is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include recognition of contract revenue  costs  profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting  estimated amounts for expected project losses  warranty costs  contract close out or other costs  recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims  collectibility of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts  the amount of reserves necessary for self insured risks  accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation reserves  valuation of assets acquired  and liabilities  goodwill  and intangible assets assumed  in acquisitions  provisions for income taxes and realizability of deferred tax assets  and the determination of liabilities under pension and other post retirement benefit programs 
an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under the us financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing it over time 
as of september   we had million of goodwill  representing of our total assets of billion 
we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 
we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant 
table of contents sustained decline in a reporting unit s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business  potential government actions toward our facilities  and other factors 
if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their book value  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we may apply various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the application of these valuation methods can be influenced by such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
rising inflation  interest rates  and or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts  in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 
rising inflation  interest rates  or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services 
in addition  we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed price and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximum price 
because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost reimbursable type contracts approximately during fiscal  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
therefore  increases in inflation  interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us 
in addition  certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions  as well as our shareholder rights agreement  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

in this md a  we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows aicpa the american institute of certified public accountants like the accounting principles board apb and the financial accounting standards board fasb  the accounting guidance promulgated by the aicpa are part of the authoritative accounting literature comprising accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
with respect to operations and maintenance o m contracts  however  we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for national government programs other than us federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  excluding option periods

sfas statement of financial accounting standards these are accounting standards adopted by the fasb 
overview net earnings for fiscal increased by million  or  as compared to last year  and earnings per share diluted grew by 
the increase in net earnings was due primarily to significant growth in activity on contracts with clients operating in a number of industries and markets including energy and refining downstream  upstream oil and gas  national government programs  and chemicals and polymers  among others 
technical professional services revenues in fiscal increased by billion  or  as compared to last year  while revenues from field services in fiscal increased by billion  or  from last year 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at september   this is down slightly from our balances at september  our net cash totaled million at september   this is also down slightly from our net cash position from a year ago 
we used million of cash and cash equivalents in fiscal to acquire businesses  this was million more than what was spent last year 
additions to property and equipment during fiscal totaled million  this was million higher than total additions made last year 
most of the increase was due to expenditures relating to fitting out and expanding new and existing office space  and computer system upgrades and system conversions 
our backlog increased billion during fiscal  from billion at september  to billion at september  
table of contents we had  employees and contract staff personnel at september   this is  or  more than at september  critical accounting policies in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results  a reader of this md a should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long term engineering and construction type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in accounting for long term engineering and construction type contracts  we follow the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule  the cost of materials and labor  and productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
in certain instances  we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients  subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on all relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

table of contents as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums 
for certain of these joint ventures ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we account for share based payment transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
accordingly  we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option 
changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option 
the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used 
accounting for pension plans in accounting for pension plans  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas and sfas require the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost  and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of our pension plans  and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used 
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal ranged from to  the same as last year 
we believe this range of rates reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering recent market conditions  projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
management  together with our actuaries  monitor trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 and other  applicable authoritative pronouncements 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
our effective tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 
contractual guarantees  litigation  investigations  and insurance in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  employment labor  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we have elected  however  to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees  litigation  and insurance claims 
we rely on qualified actuaries and other professionals to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance related claims that are known and have been asserted against us  and for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis  but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 
testing goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in conducting the impairment test  we may apply  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 
foreign currencies we transact business in various currencies 
the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the currency of the local country 
consequently  and in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation  revenues and expenses of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using weighted average exchange rates for the applicable period s being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are generally translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the net effect of the foreign currency translation process translating the income statement accounts at rates that are different from those used to translate balance sheet accounts is included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our net exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is limited because  in general  our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective functional currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies  we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies 
in those situations  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts 
results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing  analysis  and consulting activities  construction services which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities  and includes direct hire construction and construction management services  and 
table of contents operations and maintenance services which includes services performed in connection with operating large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each fiscal year ended september in thousands technical professional services revenues project services process  scientific  and systems consulting total technical professional services revenues field services revenues construction operations and maintenance total field services revenues we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets 
we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each fiscal year ended september in thousands energy refining downstream national government programs chemicals and polymers oil gas upstream pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings industrial and other a a includes projects for our clients operating in the technology and manufacturing  pulp and paper  food and consumer products  and basic resources industries  among others 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by billion  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal revenues increased among all of the industry groups and markets we serve 
we saw particularly robust business activity by clients in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry 
capital spending by clients operating in the upstream markets continued to be positively influenced during fiscal by 
table of contents higher crude prices 
and although crude prices weakened toward the end of fiscal  partly as a result of the late strengthening in the us dollar  we do not expect to see large scale delays or cancellations by most of our major clients in fiscal we believe that in certain geographic areas in which we operate  particularly in the canadian oil sands  there will continue to be significant capital spending by our upstream oil and gas clients in fiscal we also saw significant revenue growth in fiscal from projects for clients operating in the energy and refining sector of the petroleum market 
most of this growth related to refinery expansion projects 
and although we expect such spending to continue in fiscal  we believe we should begin to see increased spending on more environmentally driven projects 
we expect these projects will focus on removing sulfur and benzene from various fuels  and complying with new ambient air quality standards 
revenues from projects for our national government clients increased by million  or  from last year 
most of the increase was attributable to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering  scientific  and other technical services 
although revenues during fiscal from environmental engineering and remediation projects was relatively flat with fiscal  we believe there are opportunities in this market to grow the business in the future 
revenues from projects performed for our buildings and infrastructure clients increased by a combined million  or  from last year 
part of the increase in infrastructure and buildings work was due to the acquisition of carter burgess  inc carter burgess in november these markets also benefited from an increase in capital spending by various clients to improve and develop their transportation infrastructure  and for projects relating to hospitals  medical and research facilities  and other technical buildings and facilities 
revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by million  or  from last year 
the increase was due primarily to continuing high demand to increase production capacity 
included in the increase in revenues for fiscal was a million increase in pass through costs 
pass through costs totaled billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal when we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs 
the level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves  as opposed to using our services  as well as on the normal ramping up and winding down of field services activities on construction and o m projects 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal for the remainder of this md a  we refer to this percentage relationship as the dc 
the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
generally speaking  the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie  where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects  and or procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical  professional services revenues  the higher the dc will be 
because pass through costs typically generate lower margins  it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues relating to pass through costs without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 
the decrease in the dc in fiscal as compared to last year was due primarily to a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion  compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was partially due to the business growth we experienced in fiscal  particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business 

table of contents generally speaking  such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses was the acquisition in november of carter burgess 
operating profit for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal  compared to in fiscal although the company improved the margins earned on technical professional services during fiscal relative to last year  the increase was offset by the higher level of sg a expenses acquired with carter burgess 
as the company continues to integrate carter burgess  we expect to see a reductions in sg a expense 
interest income for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a lower rate of interest earned on our deposits during fiscal as compared to last year 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal as compared to last year 
miscellaneous income  net for fiscal increased million to million as compared to last year 
included in this amount is a million gain from the sale  recognized in the first quarter of fiscal  of the company s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities 
we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate in fiscal was the same as fiscal in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for the year ended september  total revenues for fiscal increased by billion  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion for fiscal revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve  lead by a combined  million increase  or  in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining  and the upstream oil and gas industries 
also contributing to the revenue growth in fiscal were a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our national government programs clients  a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries  and a million increase  or  in revenues from projects for our infrastructure clients 
with respect to projects for our clients operating in the oil and gas and refining industries  revenue from the downstream sector grew by million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal most of this increase related to higher capital spending on projects involving the reconfiguration and expansion of existing refineries  and addressing the effects of changing crude inputs from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain 
table of contents slightly higher levels of sulfur 
we also saw increases in capital spending by many of our refinery clients involving projects driven by government regulations 
these include projects to comply with the nonroad diesel emission and other similar standards 
revenue from the upstream sector of the oil gas and refining industries grew by million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal we saw a high level of spending in fiscal by our clients on oil and gas extraction projects  particularly in the oil sands area of canada 
revenues from projects for our national government programs clients increased by million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal most of the increase was due to higher levels of revenue from the us federal government relating to various aerospace and defense projects 
revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal due to continued demand to increase production capacity 
revenues from projects performed for our infrastructure clients increased by million in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal part of the increase was due to the acquisition of edwards and kelcey  inc edwards and kelcey in april edwards and kelcey contributed million in revenues during fiscal the balance of the increase in infrastructure revenues was due to higher spending by clients on projects for improved roads  highways  and bridges 
included in the above increase in revenues was a million increase in pass through costs 
pass through costs totaled  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal pass through costs as a percentage of field services revenues in fiscal and were essentially unchanged 
the dc was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in the dc in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues relative to field services revenues 
also contributing to the decrease in the dc was a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was due almost entirely to the business growth we experienced in fiscal  particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business 
generally speaking  such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses was the acquisition of edwards and kelcey  which contributed million of sg a expenses in fiscal operating profit for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in operating profit during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues  the improvement in our level of sg a expenses relative to technical professional services revenues  and a slight improvement in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 
interest income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to fiscal combined with a slight increase in the rate of interest earned on our deposits 
we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal our overall effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the company s overall effective tax rate for fiscal was positively affected by the favorable settlement of a matter with the us internal revenue service irs  off set in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures 
the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction of million to the fiscal total tax expense 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file 
table of contents income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september  in thousands total payments due by fiscal period year or less years years more than years long term debt obligations operating leases a obligations under defined benefit pension plans b obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans c purchase obligations d total a assumes the company will make end of lease term residual value guarantee payments of million in and million in with respect to the lease of two office buildings in houston  texas 
b assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of september  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
c assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of september  d represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september  backlog the following table summarizes our backlog at september    and in millions technical professional services field services total because the entire value of a contract is added to backlog as soon as the contract is awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time  and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years  we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis  rather than on a sequential  quarter over quarter basis 
our backlog at september  increased by billion  or  to billion from billion at september  the increase in backlog during fiscal was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating in the downstream energy and refining  and national government programs 

table of contents in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we removed billion of revenue from backlog relating to a project in the canadian oil sands 
we removed the revenue  which would have been performed over the next three fiscal years  after being informed by the client that he intends to transfer the remaining phases of the project to another contractor 
the client s decision was the result of a breakdown in our relationship with the client 
of the amount removed from backlog  billion was in field services  substantially in the form of pass through revenues 
we are working diligently to rebuild our relationship with this customer 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
total backlog at september  included approximately billion  or of total backlog  relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies 
this compares to approximately billion  or of total backlog  and billion  or of total backlog  of us federal backlog at september  and  respectively 
most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
subject to the factors discussed in item a risk factors  above  we estimate that approximately billion  or  of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in detail in item a risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and million of available capacity under our million unsecured  revolving credit facility discussed below 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  to million 
this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during fiscal  and an increase of million during fiscal during fiscal  we generated net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of million and million  respectively 
these inflows were offset by outflows from investing activities of million and the effect of exchange rate changes of million 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts  a million decrease relating to higher stock based compensation including the related excess tax benefits  and million of gains relating to sales of investments and other assets the cash flows from which are reclassified to the investing section within our consolidated statements of cash flows 
these decreases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by a million increase in net earnings  a million increase in depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and improvements  and a million increase in the amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents we used million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal this compares to net cash outflow of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an additional million increase in cash used for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired  a million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment  net of disposals  and changes in miscellaneous non current assets of million 
these uses were offset in part by a million change in investments  net included in this amount is million of cash received in connection with the sale of our interest in a company that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities 
we used a total of million of cash  net of cash acquired and inclusive of acquisition related costs during fiscal to acquire  among other businesses  carter burgess  inc  lindsey engineering services limited  and a interest in zamel turbag consulting engineers 
our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million during fiscal and cash inflows of million during fiscal the million increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million net increase in cash flows relating to our borrowing activities  a million increase in cash flows attributable to issuances of common stock including the related excess tax benefits  and a million increase to other  long term deferred liabilities 
the sub prime mortgage crisis and the resulting economic downturn have significantly impacted the capital and credit markets 
although it is presently not possible to predict the full effect this situation will have on us  the following is a discussion of some of the risks and possible consequences 
also  please refer to item a risk factors  above 
risks associated with our customers ability to pay for services and finance projects although our customer base includes the us and other national governments  as well as a wide range of large  national and multi national companies operating in a very diverse range of markets  we believe it s possible that the current economic downturn and credit crisis may affect some of our customers ability to access the capital they may require to complete their projects 
this situation could affect us two ways first  payments on our accounts receivable may not occur or be delayed 
second  clients may be forced to delay projects that have been awarded to us 
if either or both of these situations were to occur  it could have a significant impact on our cash flows 
it could also affect our future profitability if major projects are delayed too long  or if they are cancelled altogether 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable very closely 
we also stay in touch with our core clients and work closely with them monitoring the economic viability and status of their projects and programs 
risks associated with our existing credit agreement we have a long term  unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity 
this facility is provided by a consortium of twelve banks  one of which was the subject of an acquisition transaction necessitated by severe debt and liquidity pressures 
a second bank in the consortium  also suffering from liquidity pressures  has been actively seeking additional capital  outside of the ordinary course of business  from investors and the government 
these two banks provide approximately of the total credit under the facility 
although only million was outstanding under this facility at september   we rely on this facility to help fund our acquisition transactions as well as provide working capital 
the inability of one or more banks in the consortium to meet its commitment under the credit facility could impede our future growth 
however  after reviewing the credit worthiness of the banks in the consortium  we have no reason to believe that access to the credit facility is materially at risk 
risks associated with our ability to access short term assets our cash balances and short term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america  europe  and asia 
none of the banks in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or 
table of contents forced receivership  or have been taken over by their governments 
some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance 
although there is no guaranty that one or more banks in which we hold our cash and investments will not fail  we do not believe  at present  there is a material risk to our ability to access these short term assets 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at september   compared to million at september  our consolidated working capital position at september  was billion  compared to billion at september  we have a long term  unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity  under which only million was utilized at september  in the form of direct borrowings 
we believe that the capacity  terms and conditions of our long term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business 
however  such off balance sheet arrangements will not have  nor are they reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors

new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements 
sfas provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas is effective for the company s fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
although the company continues to assess the potential effects of sfas  it does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material affect on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only committed source for long term credit is a million syndicated revolving credit facility 
the total amount outstanding under this facility at september  was million 
this agreement expires in may  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we continuously monitor changes in interest rates  and use cash provided from operations to re pay our borrowings as quickly as possible 
furthermore  the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency  we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies  we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies 
we follow the provisions of sfas in accounting for our derivative contracts 
at september   we had a euro put option outstanding with a notional amount of million with an average exchange rate of eur to gbp 
this derivative contract expires in october of we ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 
at september   we had a euro forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of million with an average exchange rate of eur to gbp 
this derivative contract expires in april of we ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 
concurrent with the fiscal acquisition of the babtie group limited  we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank 
the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries 
based on the terms of the contract  we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september  should be limited to million of expense  of which million will be recognized in the next months 
we recorded million of expense during fiscal at september   the notional amount of the contract was million 
it provides for an average exchange rate of gbp to usd  and expires in june of we have determined that this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas the fair value of derivative contracts included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled million and million at september  and september   respectively
