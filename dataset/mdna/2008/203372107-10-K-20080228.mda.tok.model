item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on december   we acquired andrew corporation andrew for approximately billion in cash and million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of andrew is significant to us and historical financial information for periods prior to the acquisition may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview commscope  inc is a world leader in infrastructure solutions for communications networks 
with the acquisition of andrew  we are a global leader in providing radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks 
through our systimax and uniprise brands  we are also a global leader in structured cabling systems for business enterprise applications 
in addition  we are the premier manufacturer of coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks and one of the leading north american providers of environmentally secure cabinets for digital subscriber line dsl and fiber to the node fttn applications 
our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  do not include the results of operations of andrew for the period from december  through december  because the results of operations for this period are immaterial to the consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows 
net sales for increased by million  or  to  million as compared to due to sales growth within each of our legacy commscope operating segments 
the strong sales growth was largely attributable to increases in sales volumes of existing products  new product introductions and price increases implemented primarily in the first half of in response to increases in raw materials costs 
sales growth was realized both domestically as well as in most international regions 
operating income for increased to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in gross margin to during compared with during and an million reduction in restructuring costs incurred 
net income increased to million for compared to reported for  reflecting the improved operating income results and a million pretax improvement in net interest income 
net income for included a gain of million related to the recovery of a note receivable from ofs brightwave 
during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the primary source of revenue from our enterprise segment was sales of structured cabling solutions to large  multinational companies  primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
the segment also includes coaxial cable for various video and data applications  other than cable television 
demand for enterprise segment products depends primarily on information technology spending by enterprises  such as communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings  campuses or data centers 
the primary source of revenue for our broadband segment was product sales to cable television system operators 
demand for our broadband segment products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television system operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenue for our carrier segment was sales of secure environmental enclosures for electronic devices and equipment 
these products are used by wireline and wireless telecommunication service providers carriers and may be sold directly to the carriers or to original equipment manufacturers oems providing equipment to such carriers 
the carrier segment also derives revenue from the sale of cables and components used by wireless providers to connect antennae to transmitters 
demand for carrier segment products depends primarily on capital spending by carriers to expand their distribution networks or increase the capacity of their networks 
our future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon successful integration of andrew with the commscope organization  global spending by wireless carriers and oems  global spending by business enterprises on information technology  investment by telecommunication companies in the communications infrastructure  overall global business conditions  our ability to manage costs successfully among our global operations  and the other factors set forth in item a of this form k 
our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures 
we have experienced significant increases and greater volatility in raw material prices during the past several years as a result of increased global demand and supply disruptions 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material price volatility through effective requirements planning  working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms and implementing price increases 
delays in implementing price increases  failure to achieve market acceptance of future price increases  or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
the following significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events 
it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a description of all of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s future estimates related to doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in future reductions to revenue 
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels to mitigate the impact of declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
product warranty reserves we recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
the product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty five years from the date of sale  depending upon the product subject to the warranty 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates  as appropriate  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
tax valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
we recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities 
the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than likely to be realized 
considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized 
based on developments in tax laws  regulations and interpretations  changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision 
we also establish allowances for value added and similar tax recoverables when it is considered probable that those assets are not collectible 
changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings 
purchase price allocation recording the acquisition of andrew and the required purchase price allocation under generally accepted accounting principles requires considerable judgment 
the net assets acquired have been preliminarily recorded at their estimated fair value at the acquisition date 
tangible assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values based on observable market values or management judgment 
separable intangible assets must be identified and valued 
in the absence of market transactions  the valuation of such assets is generally based on subjective discounted cash flow methods 
for amortizable intangible assets  a remaining useful life must be selected  which requires estimates regarding the period of future use of the assets 
impairment reviews management reviews amortizing intangible assets  investments and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives have been tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected from these assets 
operating performance  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact estimates of expected future cash flows 
any impairment indicated by this analysis would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s prior estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are developed from actuarial valuations 
critical assumptions inherent in these valuations include the discount rate  health care cost trend rate  rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates 
assumptions are subject to change each year based on changes in market conditions and in management s assumptions about future events 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities

any pro forma information is intended to provide information regarding how commscope might have looked if the acquisition had occurred as of january  the andrew amounts included in this pro forma information for and are based on andrew s historical results and  therefore  may not be indicative of the actual results when operated as part of commscope 
the pro forma adjustments represent management s best estimates based on information available at the time the pro forma information was prepared and may differ from the adjustments that may actually have been required 
accordingly  the pro forma financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred as of the date indicated or that may be achieved in the future 
net sales the increase in consolidated net sales during over is attributable to domestic and international sales growth in each of our segments 
the improvement is the result of higher sales volume levels as well as price increases implemented primarily in the first half of in response to higher raw materials costs 
for further details by segment  see the section titled segment results below 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for increased by million to million and gross profit margin increased to compared to for these improvements reflect the impact of improved manufacturing utilization as a result of higher sales volumes  changes in the product mix toward products that generate higher margins  cost savings achieved as a result of restructuring activities and price increases implemented primarily in the first half of that were largely in response to raw material cost increases 
selling  general and administrative expense the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expense is largely attributable to higher marketing costs associated with the higher level of sales and spending to support and expand global sales initiatives 
also contributing to the increase in sg a was a million increase in equity based compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
during  we incurred million in costs related to the acquisition of andrew  which were included in sg a 
during  we incurred million in costs  also included in sg a  related to an unsuccessful attempt to acquire andrew 
the reduction in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales from in to in is a result of the higher sales volume in research and development research and development r d expense increased by million to million during but decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in as a result of higher net sales in the ongoing r d activities generally relate to bringing new products to market and to modifying existing products to better serve our customers 
r d expenses are primarily incurred in the enterprise and carrier segments 
restructuring costs we recognized million of pretax restructuring charges during  compared to million recognized during the charges primarily related to equipment relocation costs associated with completing the global manufacturing initiatives that began in august the charges relate to equipment relocation and employee related costs incurred as a result of the global manufacturing initiatives the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives were to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities  consolidating operations at the csmi omaha facility into one building and closing a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late no additional charges are expected to be incurred in conjunction with the global manufacturing initiatives 
as a result of restructuring actions  there is unutilized space in our omaha facility that we are currently attempting to sell 
as of december   assets with a net book value of million  which are classified as property  plant and equipment  are being marketed for sale and additional charges  which are not expected to be material  may be incurred in completing this process 
as a result of completing the acquisition of andrew  we have significantly expanded our global manufacturing and distribution presence 
as part of our cost reduction program  we expect to consolidate distribution and manufacturing facilities 
consolidation among facilities to address redundancies or excess capacity may result in future restructuring charges and such charges may be material 
net interest income net interest income during was million compared to million during this improvement is primarily due to higher interest income from the significantly higher balances of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that existed throughout most of as a result of completing the acquisition of andrew on december   we added a significant level of debt and reduced the level of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december   reflecting primarily the borrowings associated with the andrew acquisition 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for compared to for excluding the impact of the gain on the ofs brightwave note receivable 
our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
the lower effective tax rate for primarily reflects changes in the mix of our taxable earnings between domestic and foreign operations 
ofs brightwave  llc in june  the company agreed to accept and received million plus accrued interest in full satisfaction of the amount owed by ofs brightwave under a million note receivable 
the note had originally been entered into in in conjunction with the company s initial acquisition of an equity interest in ofs brightwave 
the carrying value of the note receivable had been written down to zero through recording commscope s equity in ofs brightwave losses and as a result of the transaction in which the company s interest in ofs brightwave was reduced to zero 
the repayment of the note receivable resulted in a million pretax gain million after tax or per diluted share 
segment results amount of net sales amount of net sales dollar change change dollars in millions net sales by segment enterprise broadband carrier inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales   total domestic sales   total international sales total worldwide sales   operating income by segment enterprise broadband carrier consolidated operating income for the year ended december   million of sales previously reported as domestic sales have been reclassified to europe  middle east and africa million  asia pacific rim million and latin america million to properly reflect customer location 
enterprise segment domestic and international enterprise segment net sales increased in as compared to  with particular strength in north america  europe middle east africa  and asia pacific regions 
the increase in net sales of enterprise segment products was primarily due to higher sales volumes of certain products  the effect of price increases and the introduction of new products 
we implemented price increases for certain enterprise products primarily in the first half of as a result of significant increases in the cost of raw materials 
the increase in operating income is attributable in large part to increased sales volume  changes in the product mix towards products that generate higher margins and the impact of cost control efforts 
the price increases that were realized were substantially offset by the impact of increased raw material costs 
also contributing to the improved operating income in is a million reduction in restructuring costs 
we expect demand for enterprise products to be driven by the ongoing need for bandwidth and high performance structured cabling in the enterprise market and affected by global information technology spending  among other things 
our ability to benefit from this expected continued demand will depend on whether we have sufficient production capacity through our internal facilities or contract manufacturers and whether we encounter supply constraints with respect to raw materials  among other factors 
broadband segment higher sales in north america and central and latin america accounted for the majority of the increase in broadband segment net sales in as compared to these increases reflect the impact of higher sales volumes as well as the impact of price increases implemented primarily in the first half of in response to higher raw materials costs 
domestic sales volume increases can be attributed to continued infrastructure needs of our large cable television system operator customers 
increases in international sales volumes  particularly in the central and latin america region  are a result of new projects and ongoing system maintenance 
domestic net sales for include incremental sales of million related to acquired businesses 
operating income for the broadband segment for increased over the comparable prior year as a result of higher sales volumes and the impact of cost reductions realized in connection with the global manufacturing initiatives 
these improvements were somewhat offset by a million provision for a specifically identified warranty issue and million related to inventory purchase accounting adjustments arising from the signal vision acquisition 
operating income for included a provision of million recorded in cost of goods sold related to the portion of value added taxes receivable at our brazilian subsidiary that are not believed to be recoverable 
the remaining balance of brazilian value added taxes receivable of million is believed to be recoverable and has been classified largely as long term in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  also contributing to the improved operating income are lower restructuring costs related to the implementation of our global manufacturing initiatives  which were million and million during and  respectively 
our ability to increase sales and operating income in the broadband segment depends on continued maintenance capital spending by the major cable television system operators and whether we are able to pass raw material price increases along to our customers  among other factors 
carrier segment the carrier segment experienced substantial net sales growth in as compared to primarily due to the performance of the integrated cabinet solutions ics product group 
the ics business has rapidly expanded and reflects an increase in shipments related to dsl and fttn deployments by telephone companies 
sales of wireless and other carrier segment products were also significantly higher in as compared to the prior year 
although domestic sales account for the majority of the increase in net sales for the carrier segment  sales in the asia pacific region were also strong in as compared to the improvement in carrier segment operating income in over is primarily due to the higher sales volume of ics products and the impact of cost reductions realized as a result of the global manufacturing initiatives 
sales of carrier products can be volatile since customer spending is mainly project driven while we remain optimistic about our opportunities for the ics product groups  we expect increased competition and price pressure 
we anticipate sales growth for our ics product group primarily due to fttn construction activity and dsl deployments 
our ability to meet increased customer demand for ics products will depend on whether we have sufficient production capacity through our internal operations and contract manufacturers  among other factors 
we also expect continued investment in cellular telephone base stations  which provides growth opportunities for our ics and wireless product groups  though the rate of growth and product profitability may be adversely impacted by consolidation among wireless carriers  among other factors 
pro forma results the following pro forma information is intended to provide information regarding how commscope might have looked if the acquisition of andrew had occurred as of january  the andrew amounts included in this pro forma information for and are based on andrew s historical calendar year results and  therefore  may not be indicative of the actual results when operated as part of commscope 
the pro forma adjustments represent management s best estimates based on information available at the time the pro forma information was prepared and may differ from the adjustments that may actually have been required 
accordingly  the pro forma financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred as of the date indicated or that may be achieved in the future

these increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales in the legacy andrew wireless network solutions operating group 
see the segment results section above for discussion of legacy commscope net sales for and antenna and cable products net sales were higher in versus primarily due to increased sales of microwave antennas and base station antenna products  which included incremental year over year sales of million from the april acquisition of precision antennas and million from the december acquisition of ems wireless 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales in field services  cable products  satellite communications and the broadband cable product line  which was sold in april antenna and cable products net sales for and include million and million  respectively  from the satellite communications product line that was sold in january wireless network solutions sales were lower in than due to decreased filter sales partially offset by increased sales of power amplifier and repeater products

combined pro forma depreciation and amortization was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no adjustment has been made to pro forma operating income to reflect the adverse impact of increasing the value of the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value less costs to complete and sell the inventory 
see the segment results section above for discussion of the legacy commscope operating income for and the decrease in combined pro forma operating income in as compared to is primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million and a million charge for the trueposition litigation judgment  both of which decreased wireless network solutions pro forma operating income 
in addition  the antenna and cable products group recorded million of impairment charges related to the satellite communications product lines and an million impairment charge related to andrew s investment in andes industries 
the operating loss for antenna and cable products for and includes operating losses of million and million  respectively  related to the satellite communications product line that was sold in january the legacy andrew operating groups also incurred charges of approximately million and million for acquisition related costs in and  respectively 
these decreases in pro forma operating income in were partially offset by a million improvement in legacy commscope operating income 
outlook we are encouraged by the global outlook for both the legacy commscope products and the legacy andrew products 
global market conditions seem to support continued growth in all major product groups 
an economic slowdown in the us or in any of our other major markets could have a significant adverse impact on our sales 
we plan to focus on our major product groups and evaluate strategies to divest certain non core or underperforming products or assets 
pricing actions in response to volatility in the cost of raw materials such as copper  aluminum and plastics could have a significant impact on our sales 
we are dependent upon continued spending for maintenance of existing infrastructure and ongoing capital investment by our customers in each segment in order to achieve an increase in sales 
while we expect higher gross profit in  we expect deterioration in gross profit as a percent of sales due to the integration of the andrew business that has historically experienced lower gross profit margins than the legacy commscope business and due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments 
in addition  we expect continued volatility in the costs of certain raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  steel and plastics and other polymers that are derived from oil and natural gas 
this volatility in raw materials may reduce gross profit margin if we delay implementing price increases  are unable to achieve market acceptance of future price increases or implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material prices 
we expect operating income to increase during  primarily due to the increase in sales as a result of the andrew acquisition and higher sales volumes and shifts in the mix of products sold to higher margin products in the legacy commscope business 
volatile raw materials costs may have an adverse impact on operating margins 
purchase accounting adjustments will have a significant adverse impact on operating income  particularly the adjustments to write up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value less costs to complete and sell and the amortization related to identifiable intangible assets recognized

increased prices and greater volatility in the cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  steel and plastics and other polymers increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we implemented price increases for certain products during and  which substantially offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million during and decreased modestly as a percentage of net sales to during compared to during the increase in sg a is largely attributable to higher selling expenses directly related to the increase in sales and somewhat attributable to a million benefit recognized in related to recovery of accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional discussion of this recovery 
also contributing to the increase in sg a were million of equity based compensation expense recognized as a result of implementing sfas no

restructuring costs we recognized million of pretax restructuring charges during  compared to million recognized during the charges relate to the global manufacturing initiatives adopted in august and the charges included million related to the global manufacturing initiatives and million related to completing the organizational and cost reduction initiatives begun in at csmi  the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives were to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities  consolidating operations at the csmi omaha facility into one building and closing a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late charges incurred during for the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs and million for equipment relocation costs  partially offset by a million net asset impairment gain primarily related to the sale of previously impaired assets 
the employee related costs include accruals for severance and related fringe benefits and are accrued ratably over the period employees are obligated to provide services in order to receive benefits 
equipment relocation costs relate directly to shifting manufacturing capacity among our global manufacturing facilities and include costs to uninstall  pack  ship and re install equipment as well as the costs to prepare the receiving facility to accommodate the equipment 
these costs are recognized as the expenses are incurred 
the net asset impairment gain recognized during reflects primarily a gain of million from the sale of production equipment that had been impaired during and an impairment charge of million relating to land at the omaha facility that is being marketed for sale and for certain assets from the scottsboro  alabama facility that were abandoned 
charges incurred during related to the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs including million of curtailment and special termination benefits relating from an early retirement offer  million for equipment relocation costs and million for asset impairment charges 
the asset impairment charges related to production equipment that was identified as excess  pending consolidation of certain production operations in other facilities 
net interest income expense net interest income during was million  compared to net interest expense of million during this improvement is primarily due to higher interest income from the significantly higher balances of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the average interest rate on outstanding borrowing was essentially unchanged due to the reduction in the balance of our senior term note due to principal payments  offset by increases in the rate on the note due to increases in short term interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for excluding the impact of the gain on the ofs brightwave note receivable  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
the modestly higher effective tax rate for reflects changes in the mix of our taxable earnings between domestic and foreign operations and the impact of not recognizing tax benefits of operating losses in certain of our foreign operations 
our tax provision included the establishment of a million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses from one of our foreign subsidiaries and million related to establishing tax reserves for various prior year state income tax matters arising from tax audits  which were substantially offset by the release of million of previously established valuation allowances related to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards

the higher prices were implemented in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  particularly metals  plastics and other polymers 
sales volumes increased in every region  with particular strength in north america  central and latin america and europe middle east africa 
the increase in operating income is attributable in large part to lower restructuring costs in million in compared to million in as the global manufacturing initiatives were substantially concluded  higher sales volume and selling prices  shifts in the mix of products sold towards products with higher profit margins and the impact of cost reduction efforts  including those realized from the global manufacturing initiatives 
broadband segment the increase in net sales of broadband segment products was primarily due to higher prices  the increased sales volumes of existing products and the sales from the mc product line that was acquired in march the higher prices were implemented in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  particularly metals  plastics and other polymers 
sales volumes increased in all regions with particular strength in north america  central and latin america and europe middle east africa 
domestic sales increases generally result from continued infrastructure needs of our large cable television system operators and international increases generally result from new projects and ongoing system maintenance 
the million decrease in operating income was due primarily to the million benefit recognized in related to the recovery of the accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in operating income in was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes and savings realized from the global manufacturing initiatives and negatively impacted by a provision of million included in cost of goods sold related to the portion of value added taxes receivable at our brazilian subsidiary that are not believed to be recoverable and by higher restructuring costs in compared to million in as the global manufacturing initiatives were largely implemented during carrier segment the increase in net sales of carrier segment products was due to significantly higher sales volume of integrated cabinet solutions ics products 
the rapid growth of the ics business reflects the demand from dsl and fttn deployments by telephone companies to support video and high speed data services 
net sales of wireless products was essentially unchanged between years and net sales of exchangemax products decreased modestly as a result of our decision during to exit the twisted pair central office cable products business 
operating income improved by million largely as a result of the higher sales volume of ics products and the benefit of cost reduction efforts  including the global manufacturing initiatives 
operating income was also favorably impacted by lower restructuring costs million in compared to million in 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview our principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under credit facilities 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings

the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  was primarily the result of cash flow from operations and cash acquired in the andrew acquisition 
the increase also reflects proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by cash utilized in the andrew acquisition  net capital expenditures  loan repayments  long term financing costs and the acquisition of signal vision  inc the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt were utilized to pay for the acquisition of andrew and related transaction costs 
the increase in working capital excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily driven by the acquisition of andrew accounts receivable and inventory  offset somewhat by the assumption of andrew current liabilities 
our long term debt and long term debt as a percent of book capital structure increased during primarily due to our new senior secured term loans that were used to fund the andrew acquisition and the outstanding balance of the andrew convertible debentures that were assumed in the acquisition 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year from million in to million in primarily due to higher operating income 
we expect to generate increased net cash from operations during primarily due to improved operating income from higher sales  including the andrew business  the impact of our cost reduction efforts and the reduction in the level of working capital excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and current portion of long term debt 
investing activities during  we acquired andrew corporation for approximately billion in cash and approximately million in stock 
we also acquired signal vision  inc in for million  of which million was paid in cash 
during  we acquired certain assets supporting the mc trunk and distribution cable television products business from trilogy communications  inc for million 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  primarily related to the sale of real estate identified as excess in connection with our global manufacturing initiatives 
we also received a million repayment of a note receivable from ofs brightwave in our investment in property  plant and equipment was relatively flat in as compared to we expect total capital expenditures during to be million to million 
financing activities in connection with the acquisition of andrew  we issued million shares of commscope stock and borrowed billion in term loans under our new senior secured credit facilities 
we had availability under the million revolving credit portion of the facilities of approximately million and had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit portion as of december  during  we paid million in fees associated with our new senior secured credit facilities 
we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities as of december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of our senior secured credit facilities 
the exercise of million stock options during generated million of proceeds and million from the tax benefits generated by such stock option exercises 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of common or preferred stock  senior or subordinated debt  convertible debt securities  warrants exercisable for any of the foregoing  or any combination thereof 
this registration statement was automatically effective upon filing  pursuant to sec rules 
on january    shares issuable as a result of conversion of andrew s convertible debentures were registered under this registration statement 
management is evaluating our capital structure and may consider various alternatives  including  but not limited to  reducing debt levels  inducing conversion of a portion or all of our convertible debentures and raising additional capital 
future cash needs we expect that our primary future cash needs will be to fund the conversion of the andrew convertible debentures a cash requirement of approximately million during the first quarter of  the remaining unpaid purchase price for andrew common stock a cash requirement of approximately million expected to be substantially funded in the first quarter of  debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and employee benefit obligations 
we are required to repay million under our new seven year senior secured term loan and currently anticipate making a million voluntary contribution to one of our defined benefit pension plans during these funding requirements are expected to be met with cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from future operations 
new funding requirements under the pension protection act of are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity or cash flow from operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our senior secured revolving credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs during  including cash requirements related to restructuring initiatives or other costs related to the andrew integration 
we may  from time to time  borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities  if market conditions are favorable  to meet our future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions amount of payments due per period contractual obligations total payments due less than year years years after years long term debt  including current maturities a  interest on long term debt a b operating leases purchase obligations c pension and postretirement benefit liabilities d foreign currency derivative e unrecognized tax benefits f total contractual obligations  a no prepayment  redemption or conversion of any of our long term debt balances has been assumed other than the conversion of the andrew convertible debentures which are assumed to convert and receive and shares of commscope common stock for each  in face value of the debentures in less than one year 
refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for information regarding the terms of our long term debt agreements 
b interest on variable rate debt is estimated based upon rates in effect as of december  c purchase obligations include minimum amounts owed under take or pay or requirements contracts 
amounts covered by open purchase orders are excluded as there is no contractual obligation until goods or services are received 
d amounts reflect expected payments under the postretirement benefit plans through see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
although there is no contractual obligation to make pension contributions  expected contributions of million have been reflected above 
e estimated payments are based on exchange rates in effect as of december  f due to the uncertainty in predicting the timing of tax payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits  million has been excluded from the presentation 
in less than one year  we believe it is reasonably possible that tax positions resulting in liabilities of million to million will be settled see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
effects of inflation and changing prices we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
the principal raw materials purchased by us copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially and become highly volatile over the last several years 
as a result  we have significantly increased our prices for certain products and may have to increase prices again in the future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs  these cost changes could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
other on october   trueposition  inc filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of delaware  alleging that andrew s sale of certain mobile location products to a customer located in the middle east infringed a trueposition patent 
mobile location systems installed in wireless networks are used to determine the position of mobile devices 
the complaint sought  among other things  injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages 
on september   a jury ruled in favor of trueposition  finding that andrew had willfully infringed a single trueposition patent in providing a mobile location system to the customer  and the jury awarded million in damages to trueposition 
management believes the verdict is in error and is seeking to have it reversed 
the jury s verdict  including the damage award  is subject to the outcome of various post verdict motions that we are currently pursuing 
in addition  the judge presiding over the case has not ruled on various equitable claims that andrew presented to the judge as part of the post trial submissions 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in having the verdict set aside by the trial court  we intend to appeal 
on october   trueposition filed a motion seeking a permanent injunction and a motion seeking to increase the damages awarded  up to trebling the amount as well as the fees and expenses of its counsel 
trueposition may also seek to recover interest on the judgment 
however  management believe the damages awarded are inappropriate  as would be any increase  any award of interest  fees or expenses or the issuance of an injunction 
as a result of the jury verdict in the case  a million liability is included in other accrued liabilities as of december   which was our estimate of the probable loss  if the jury verdict is not reduced  set aside or overturned 
the litigation with trueposition may result in the loss of future revenue opportunities  including opportunities to manufacture and sell products using uplink time difference of arrival u tdoa technology  however  we are not currently able to assess the likelihood or magnitude of such potential losses 
at issue in the litigation with trueposition is a patent that trueposition argued was infringed by an andrew u tdoa mobile location system that is being deployed under multiple phases with the customer 
andrew was awarded the initial two phases with this customer for an expanded deployment of this strategic project which  when completed  will cover approximately a thousand cell sites 
there are additional phases  not all of which have been awarded by the customer  for approximately two thousand additional cell sites 
the jury verdict includes claims related to all such cell sites  including those already installed and those to be installed 
the patent at issue relates only to certain implementations using u tdoa technology 
as a result  other customer installations and projects that use different mobile location technologies are not impacted 
we reached an agreement with the us department of justice doj on december  that allowed us to complete our acquisition of andrew 
under the terms of an agreed form of final judgment  which was filed december  in us district court for the district of columbia  commscope is required to divest certain non core assets  including andrew s non controlling minority interest in andes industries  inc  a supplier of last mile products for broadband communications networks  and other related assets 
this agreed form of final judgment is subject to the court s approval 
the carrying value of the assets to be divested was less than million as of december  we are actively engaged in the process of working toward divestiture of these assets 
any divestiture is subject to the doj s approval 
we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in other pending legal matters in the normal course of business 
as a result of the andrew acquisition  we became subject to additional legal matters  including asserted and unasserted claims 
management believes none of these other legal matters  other than that discussed above  will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition upon their final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
newly issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements which defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
as of january  on a prospective basis 
in february  the fasb issued a one year deferral of the effective date of certain portions of sfas no 
as they apply to most non financial assets and liabilities in order to address various implementation issues that have been identified 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities which gives companies the option to carry most financial assets or liabilities at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
as of january  the company does not plan to measure any of its existing financial assets or liabilities at fair value under the provisions of sfas no 
and  therefore  does not anticipate any material impact to its results of operations or financial position related to the adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  among other methods  to hedge some of these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the table below summarizes the combined interest and principal payments associated with the variable rate term loans and interest rate swap we entered into in connection with the andrew acquisition see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the principal payments presented below are based on the scheduled maturities in the credit agreement 
the interest payments presented below assume the interest rate in effect as of december  and include the impact of the interest rate swap  which serves to fix a portion of the interest payments on our variable rate debt 
the projected future payments on the interest rate swap reflected in the table below are based on the forward interest rate curve in effect as of the date of the table 
settlement of the fair value of this hedging instrument as of december  would have resulted in a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
the unrealized loss on this cash flow hedge is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on projected future interest payments related to the unhedged portions of the term loans is also included in the table below 
for the year ended december  there after total principal and interest payments on variable rate term loans average interest rate interest rate swap payments receipts impact of an increase in interest rates of basis points we also have fixed rate convertible debentures outstanding 
the fair value of these debentures is subject to fluctuations as our stock price and interest rates change 
the table below summarizes our expected interest and principal payments related to our fixed rate debt as well as the fair value of these instruments at december  we assume all of the convertible debentures we assumed in the andrew acquisition will be converted into merger consideration of and shares of commscope common stock for each  in face value of the debentures in we also assume in the table below that our convertible debentures will not be redeemed until their scheduled maturity in  although we have the option to redeem earlier and the noteholders have options to require us to repurchase them before their scheduled maturity see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the fair value of our convertible debentures is based on quoted market prices while the fair value of our convertible debentures is based on the value of merger consideration those noteholders were entitled to receive 
for the year ended december  there after fair value total principal and interest payments on fixed rate debt average interest rate foreign currency risk approximately and of our and net sales  respectively  were to customers located outside the us with the acquisition of andrew  a greater portion of our sales are expected to be to foreign customers and denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
conversely  significant increases in the value of currencies as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect profitability as certain product costs increase relative to a us dollar denominated sales price 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures 
as of december   we held a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement  which hedges a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary and a portion of our other euro denominated asset exposure 
under the swap agreement  we receive interest in us dollars and pay interest in euros 
settlement of the fair value of this hedging instrument as of december  and would have resulted in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
the portion of these unrealized losses that relates to the hedge of our belgian subsidiary is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss while the remainder of the unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
for the year ended december  fair value there after total cross currency swap receive usd pay eur contract amount usd commodity price risk materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and supply and demand levels  among other factors 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products have resulted in  and may continue to result in  higher overall production costs 
as of december   we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
in the normal course of business  we were obligated as of december  to purchase approximately million of commodities under take or pay contracts within the next year
