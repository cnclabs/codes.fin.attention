wyco owns a state regulated intrastate gas pipeline that extends from the cheyenne hub in northeast colorado to public service company of colorado s psco fort st 
vrain electric generation plant 
wyco also owns a compressor station on our wic system s medicine bow lateral in wyoming and leases these pipeline and compression facilities to psco and wic  respectively  under long term leases 
wyco currently has two expansion projects underway  the high plains pipeline and totem storage expansion projects  expected to be completed in and cig will lease these facilities and will be the operator of these projects 
underground natural gas storage facilities in addition to the storage along our pipeline systems  we own or have interests in the following natural gas storage facilities as of december  ownership storage storage entity interest capacity location percent bcf bear creek storage louisiana young gas storage colorado approximately bcf is contracted to affiliates 
amounts are not adjusted for our ownership interest 
lng facility we own an lng receiving terminal located on elba island  near savannah  georgia with a peak sendout capacity of bcf d and a base load sendout capacity of bcf d 
the capacity at the terminal is contracted with subsidiaries of british gas group and royal dutch shell plc 

table of contents in september  we received ferc approval to expand the elba island lng receiving terminal and construct the elba express pipeline 
the expansion is anticipated to increase the peak sendout capacity of the terminal from bcf d to bcf d 
the elba express pipeline will consist of approximately miles of pipeline with a total capacity of bcf d  which will transport natural gas from the elba island lng terminal to markets in the southeastern and eastern united states 
in february  we completed our acquisition of a percent interest in the gulf lng clean energy project  which is constructing a ferc approved liquefied natural gas terminal in pascagoula  mississippi that is expected to be placed in service in late markets and competition our pipelines segment provides natural gas services to a variety of customers  including natural gas producers  marketers  end users and other natural gas transmission  distribution and electric generation companies 
in performing these services  we compete with other pipeline service providers as well as alternative energy sources such as coal  nuclear energy  wind  hydroelectric power and fuel oil 
imported lng is one of the fastest growing supply sectors of the natural gas market 
lng terminals and other regasification facilities can serve as important sources of supply for pipelines  enhancing their delivery capabilities and operational flexibility and complementing traditional supply transported into market areas 
however  these lng delivery systems may also compete with our pipelines for transportation of gas into the market areas we serve 
electric power generation is the fastest growing demand sector of the natural gas market 
the growth of the electric power industry potentially benefits the natural gas industry by creating more demand for natural gas turbine generated electric power 
this potential benefit is offset  in varying degrees  by increased generation efficiency  the more effective use of surplus electric capacity  increased natural gas prices and the use and availability of other fuel sources for power generation 
in addition  in several regions of the country  new additions in electric generating capacity have exceeded load growth and electric transmission capabilities out of those regions 
these developments may inhibit owners of new power generation facilities from signing firm transportation contracts with natural gas pipelines 
our existing contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity 
our ability to extend our existing contracts or remarket expiring capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives  the regulatory environment at the federal  state and local levels and market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire 
the duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices  competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility 
subject to regulatory requirements  we attempt to recontract or remarket our capacity at the rates allowed under our tariffs although  at times  we discount these rates to remain competitive 
the level of discount varies for each of our pipeline systems 
the table below shows our firm transportation contracts as of december  for our wholly and majority owned systems that expire by year over the next five years and thereafter 
bar diagram the following table details information related to our pipeline systems  including the customers  contracts  markets served and the competition faced by each as of december  firm customers reserve capacity on our pipeline system  storage facilities or lng terminalling facilities and are obligated to pay a monthly reservation or demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they transport or store  for the term of their contracts 
interruptible customers are customers without reserved capacity that pay usage charges based on the volume of gas they request to transport  store  inject or withdraw

ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  an independent reservoir engineering firm that reports to the audit committee of our board of directors  conducted an audit of the estimates of percent of our consolidated proved natural gas and oil reserves as of december  the scope of the audit performed by ryder scott included the preparation of an independent estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserves estimates for fields comprising greater than percent of our total worldwide present value of future cash flows pretax 
the specific fields included in ryder scott s audit represented the largest fields based on value 
ryder scott also conducted an audit of the estimates of percent of the proved natural gas and oil reserves of four star  our unconsolidated affiliate 
our estimates of four star s proved natural gas and oil reserves are prepared by our internal reservoir engineers and do not reflect 
table of contents those prepared by the engineers of four star 
based on the amount of proved reserves determined by ryder scott  we believe our reported reserve amounts are reasonable 
ryder scott s reports are included as exhibits to this annual report on form k 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production costs  and projecting the timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the reserve data represents only estimates which are often different from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is highly dependent on the quality of available data  the accuracy of the assumptions on which they are based  and on engineering and geological interpretations and judgment 
all estimates of proved reserves are determined according to the rules currently prescribed by the securities and exchange commission sec 
these rules indicate that the standard of reasonable certainty be applied to proved reserve estimates 
this concept of reasonable certainty implies that as more technical data becomes available  a positive or upward revision is more likely than a negative or downward revision 
estimates are subject to revision based upon a number of factors  including reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and government restrictions 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of that estimate 
in general  the volume of production from natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire additional properties with proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  but future events  including commodity price changes  may cause these assumptions to change 
in addition  estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and proved non producing reserves are subject to greater uncertainties than estimates of proved producing reserves 
for further discussion of our reserves  see part ii
