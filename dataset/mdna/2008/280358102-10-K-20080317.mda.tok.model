table of contents marketing  sales and strategic alliances marketing 
the primary goal of all of our marketing efforts is to generate sales opportunities by increasing edgewater s brand awareness and value proposition 
our marketing efforts continued to be closely aligned with our go to market strategy  while introducing specific offerings that address business and it challenges clients face within a particular vertical market 
we have developed core competencies in delivering our services in key markets to increase the efficiency of our marketing efforts  we target specific areas of content on a monthly basis for each of our vertical practice areas 
marketing builds campaigns around each content area  which include marketing collateral  webinars  sell sheets  tradeshow conference participation  speaking engagements  direct mail and public relations activities 
sales 
our sales approach is to combine traditional sales with our strength in verticals and technology 
our traditional sales function is comprised of direct sales professionals and inside sales professionals 
both work closely with our practice directors to identify potential opportunities within each account 
using a consultative selling methodology  target prospects are identified and a pursuit plan is developed for each key account 
when contact with a target is established  we utilize a blended sales model to demonstrate our expertise  combining consultative selling with traditional sales methods  which typically consists of a business development manager  an industry consultant and a technology consultant 
this team approach to selling allows edgewater to demonstrate  from the initial contact point  its expertise in both the specific industry as well as technology 
once the customer has engaged edgewater  our sales professionals maintain their relationships with the customer by working collaboratively with the consulting professionals who are assigned to the customer 
strategic alliances 
as part of our sales and marketing effort  we have established working relationships with a number of companies  including american student assistance  emc document sciences corporation  ibm cognos  informatica corporation  iso insurance technology solutions  microsoft  optical image technology  oracle usa  inc formerly hyperion solutions  sap outlooksoft and sun microsystems 
these alliances generally entail sharing sales leads  joint marketing efforts  making joint customer presentations  negotiating discounts on license fees or other charges and conducting similar activities 
our arrangements with many of these companies are informal and are not subject to definitive written agreements 
for those companies with whom we do have definitive written agreements  those agreements are either terminable at will by either party or are for terms of one year or less 
we believe we have been successful in establishing alliances with a strong group of companies who are either industry leaders or well regarded new entrants 
professional recruitment  retention and development our success depends in part upon our ability to recruit and retain business and technology professionals with the high level of skills and experience needed to provide our premium services 
we believe that the combination of professional support  intellectual challenge  corporate culture and compensation we offer will continue to be attractive to these highly skilled professionals 
our working environment also fosters collaboration  creativity and innovation 
we believe that our employees are one of our most valuable assets 
employees 
as of december   edgewater had employees 
of these employees  were billable consultants and were management and administrative personnel  comprising sales  marketing  human resources  finance  accounting  internal information systems and administrative support 
the average tenure of our employee base is approximately years and the average years of experience is approximately years 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our employee relations are strong 
culture 
we believe that our business culture is critically important in hiring and retaining qualified professionals 
our ability to provide effective multidisciplinary teams is dependent upon our ability to develop and sustain a business culture that is common across all disciplines and vertical practices throughout our company 
our employees are talented and energetic professionals that come from a multitude of professional backgrounds 
edgewater believes that this creates an exciting  diverse  and creative work environment for our employees 
compensation 
we have a competitive compensation program that has been structured to attract and retain highly skilled professionals 
edgewater s cash  bonus and equity compensation plans are tied to the achievement of the company s financial performance along with individual and team performance goals 
recruiting 
we believe that our long term success will depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
our recruitment department has traditionally conducted its own direct recruiting efforts and coordinated informal and search firm referrals 
we believe that our business model  which results in an intellectually stimulating work environment  provides greater opportunities for professional development and a dynamic corporate culture  which enhances our ability to attract and retain top professionals 

table of contents professional development 
we believe that providing our professionals with a wide variety of challenging projects  the opportunity to demonstrate ability and achieve professional advancement are keys to their retention 
we work with our professionals to assist them with their professional development by offering internal and external learning opportunities 
we encourage them to attain industry certifications which strengthen their expertise in both business and technology 
in addition  we also believe that the working relationships they form on various project teams foster valuable formal and informal mentoring and knowledge sharing 
competition our service offerings consist of a full spectrum of services and expertise to ensure the success of it projects 
our competitors include it solutions providers  in house technical staff  software product companies with extended service organizations  international outsourcers of it development  application and web hosting firms and specialized providers of cpm bam bi 
there is significant competition in the management and it consulting services space 
mergers or consolidations in our market may create new  larger or better capitalized competitors with enhanced abilities to attract and retain professionals 
we also believe that the principle criteria considered by prospective clients when selecting a consulting firm include skills and capabilities of consultants  scope of services  service model approach  global presence  industry and technical expertise  reputation and quality of past work  perceived value and a results orientation 
the following is a representative list of competitors in the it and management consulting services space technical consulting systems integrators accenture  cmgi  eds  ibm global services  business and decision group  caritor  inc  logicacmg  perficient  and sapient  offshore software development firms aztec software  cognizant technology solutions  infosys  ventyx  satyam  tata  and wipro  management business consulting firms bain company  booz allen hamilton  boston consulting group  diamond management and technology consultants  inc  and mckinsey company  corporate performance management cpm business activity monitoring bam business intelligence bi providers the hackett group  hitachi consulting corporation  and hewlett packard  and computer hardware  software and service vendors hewlett packard  ibm  oracle and sap 
intellectual property we consider our intellectual property to be a valuable asset in a highly competitive industry 
we also consider our intellectual property to be an important factor in building brand recognition for quality service and performance 
therefore  we have secured certain service marks for edgewater  edgewater technology  edgewater technology ranzal and edgewater strategy services among others 
we believe we have secured all rights to trademarks and trade names related to our business 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
in particular  we require each of our employees to sign an invention and non disclosure agreement  which provides that they must maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property and that any intellectual property that they develop while employed by us is the property of edgewater 
we have developed detailed tools  processes and methodologies which are used in developing software code  scripts  libraries  data models  applications  business processes  frameworks and other technology used within our company and in customer engagements

potential future strategies  transactions and changes critical to our ability to create long term stockholder value  the company will continue to pursue internal growth initiatives and appropriate business combination transaction alternatives to achieve growth 
from time to time  we have engaged and we may continue to engage in preliminary discussions with various persons regarding potential business combination transactions 
we believe that our current cash reserves and our anticipated cash flow from our operations will be  taken together  adequate for our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual experience may differ significantly from our expectation  particularly if we pursue growth through business combination transactions  which we presently believe will be advantageous to building long term stockholder value 
in addition  other future events may adversely or materially affect our business  expenses or prospects and could affect our available cash or the availability or cost of external financial resources 

table of contents we may  in the future  purchase common stock in the open market  in private transactions or otherwise  pursuant to any future board approved repurchase programs 
see item market for registrants common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities included elsewhere in the form k 
any future purchases by us will depend on many factors  including the market price of our common stock at that time  our business strategy  our business and financial position  and general economic and market conditions 
item a 
risk factors risk factors affecting finances  business prospects and stock volatility in addition to other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating edgewater technology and its business because such factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
these risk factors could cause actual results to materially differ from those projected in any forward looking statements 
our success depends on a limited number of significant customers  and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by the loss of a major customer or significant project or the failure to collect a large account receivable 
we generate a significant portion of our service revenue from a limited number of customers 
as a result  if we were to lose a major customer or large project  our service revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
in  our five largest customers accounted for of our service revenue 
in  our five largest customers accounted for of our service revenue 
we perform varying amounts of work for specific customers from year to year 
a major customer in one year may not use our services in another year 
in addition  we may derive revenue from a major customer that constitutes a large portion of a particular quarter s total revenue 
if we lose any major customers or any of our customers cancel or significantly reduce a large project s scope  including but not limited to synapse  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
further  if we fail to collect a large accounts receivable balance  we could be subjected to a material adverse impact on financial results and a decrease in cash flow 
our lack of long term customer contracts reduces the predictability of our revenues because these contracts may be canceled on short notice and without penalty 
our customers generally retain us on a project by project basis  rather than under long term contracts 
as a result  a customer may not engage us for further services once a project is complete 
if a significant customer  or a number of customers  terminate  significantly reduce  or modify their contracts with us  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
consequently  future revenue should not be predicted or anticipated based on the number of customers we have or the number and size of our existing projects 
if a customer were to postpone  modify  or cancel a project  including but not limited to changes in anticipated synapse related revenue  we would be required to shift our consultants to other projects to minimize the impact on our operating results 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in efficiently and effectively shifting our consultants to new projects in the event of project terminations  which could result in reduced service revenue and lower gross margins 
if we experience unexpected changes or variability in our revenue  we could experience variations in our quarterly operating results and our actual results may differ materially from the amounts planned and our operating profitability may be reduced or eliminated 
if we fail to satisfy our customers expectations  our existing and continuing business could be adversely affected 
our sales and marketing strategy emphasizes our belief that we have highly referenceable accounts 
therefore  if we fail to satisfy the expectations of our customers  we could damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  if we fail to deliver and perform on our engagements  we could be liable to our customers for breach of contract 
although most of our contracts limit the amount of any damages to the fees we receive  we could still incur substantial cost  negative publicity  and diversion of management resources to defend a claim  and as a result  our business results could suffer 
we may have lower margins  or lose money  on fixed price contracts 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to grow our business with time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts  and fixed fee contracts 
in  fixed price contracts represented approximately of our service revenue 
we assume greater financial risk on fixed price contracts than on time and materials or fixed fee engagements  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully price our larger fixed price contracts 
if we fail to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement  fail to manage customer expectations effectively or fail to complete fixed price engagements within planned budgets  on time and to our customers satisfaction  we could be exposed to cost overruns  potentially leading to lower gross profit margins  or even losses on these engagements 
competition in the it and management consulting services market is intense and  therefore  we may lose projects to  or face pricing pressure from  our competitors or prospective customers internal it departments or international outsourcing firms 
the market for it and management consulting providers is highly competitive 
in many cases  we compete for premium it services work with in house technical staff  software product companies with extended service organizations and other international it and management consulting firms  including offshore outsourcing firms 
in addition  there are many small  boutique technology management consulting firms who have developed services similar to those offered by us 
we believe that 
table of contents competition will continue to be strong and may increase in the future  especially if our competitors continue to reduce their price for it and management consulting services 
such pricing pressure could have a material impact on our revenues and margins and limit our ability to provide competitive services 
our target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change 
as a result  our competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
existing or future competitors may develop or offer it and management consulting services that provide significant technological  creative  performance  price or other advantages over the services we offer 
see item business competition for a representative list of competitors in the it and management consulting services space 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and managerial resources than we do 
there are relatively low barriers of entry into our business 
we have no patented or other proprietary technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the it services market 
therefore  we must rely on the skill of our personnel and the quality of our customer service 
the costs to start an it and management consulting services firm are low 
we expect that we will continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future  offshore providers and larger integrators and we are subject to the risk that our employees may leave us and may start competing businesses 
any one or more of these factors could have a material impact on our business 
because we rely on highly trained and experienced personnel to design and build complex systems for our customers  an inability to retain existing employees and attract new qualified employees would impair our ability to provide our services to existing and new customers 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract new qualified employees and retain existing highly trained and experienced technical consultants  project management consultants  business analysts and sales and marketing professionals of various experience levels 
if we fail to attract new employees or retain our existing employees  we may be unable to complete existing projects or bid for new projects of similar size  which could adversely affect our revenues 
while attracting and retaining experienced employees is critical to our business and growth strategy  maintaining our current employee base may also be particularly difficult 
even if we are able to grow and expand our employee base  the additional resources required to attract new employees and retain existing employees may adversely affect our operating margins 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success depends on the continued employment of the senior management team and other key personnel 
this dependence is particularly important to our business because personal relationships are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining customer engagements 
if one or more members of the senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
furthermore  other companies seeking to develop in house business capabilities may hire away some of our key personnel 
past or future business combination transactions or other strategic alternatives could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our business 
we realized recent growth  in part  through acquisitions  and we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished through one or more business combination transactions or other strategic alternatives 
the ultimate success of any such transactions will depend upon  among other things  our ability to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this regard or that we will be able to identify suitable opportunities  successfully grow acquired businesses  integrate acquired personnel and operations successfully or utilize our cash or equity securities as acquisition currency on acceptable terms to complete any such business combination transactions 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
any such transactions would involve certain other risks  including the reduction of cash and or working capital  the assumption of additional liabilities  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and diversion of management s attention from operating activities 
volatility of our stock price could result in expensive class action litigation 
if our common stock suffers from volatility like the securities of other technology and consulting companies  we could be subject to securities class action litigation similar to that which has been brought against other companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their common stock 
the process of defending against these types of claims  regardless of their merit  is costly and often creates a considerable distraction to senior management 
any future litigation could result in substantial additional costs and could divert our resources and senior management s attention 
this could harm our productivity and profitability and potentially adversely affect our stock price 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which could adversely affect our business 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights 
we do not have any patents or patent applications pending 
existing trade secret and copyright laws afford us only limited protection 
third parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
this is particularly true in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
others may independently develop and obtain patents or copyrights for 
table of contents technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unsuccessful in any future intellectual property litigation  we may be forced to do one or more of the following cease selling or using technology or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  to use the relevant technology  configure services to avoid infringement  and refund license fees or other payments that we have previously received 
generally  we develop software applications for specific customer engagements 
issues relating to ownership of and rights to use software applications and frameworks can be complicated 
also  we may have to pay economic damages in these disputes  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results can sometimes be volatile 
we believe comparisons of prior period operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
if our revenues or our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate in the future include the following variability in market demand for it and management consulting services  length of the sales cycle associated with our service offerings  unanticipated variations in the size  budget  number or progress toward completion of our engagements  unanticipated termination of a major engagement  a customer s decision not to proceed with an engagement we anticipated or the completion or delay during a quarter of several major customer engagements  efficiency with which we utilize our employees  or utilization  including our ability to transition employees from completed engagements to new engagements  our ability to manage our operating costs  a large portion of which are fixed in advance of any particular quarter  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  seasonality and cyclicality  including the effects of lower utilization rates during periods with disproportionately high holiday and vacation usage experience  timing and cost of new office expansions  the timing of customer year end periods and the impact of spending relative to such year end periods  our ability to manage future growth  and costs of attracting  retaining and training skilled personnel 
some of these factors are within our control  while others are outside of our control 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and or delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company 
our board of directors can issue preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock provision could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
in addition  our company has a stockholder rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that may discourage an attempt to obtain control by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
if a person acquires or more of our outstanding shares of common stock  except for certain institutional stockholders  who may acquire up to of our outstanding shares of common stock  then rights under this plan would be triggered  which would significantly dilute the voting rights of any such acquiring person 
certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may also discourage someone from acquiring or merging with us 
if clients view offshore development as a viable alternative to our service offerings  our pricing  revenue  margins and profitability may be negatively affected 
a trend has developed where international it service firms have been founded in countries such as india and china  which have well educated and technically trained workforces available at wage rates that are substantially lower than us wage rates 
while traditionally we have not competed with offshore development  presently this form of software development is experiencing rapid and increasing acceptance in the market 
to counteract this trend  we are focusing towards premium service offerings  including design and strategy consulting engagements  which are more difficult for offshore development firms to replicate 
if we are unable to continually evolve our service offerings or the rate of acceptance of offshore development advances even faster than we expect  then our pricing and revenue could be adversely affected 
we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future quarters 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and related intangible assets with a net book value of million related to prior acquisitions 
we test for impairment at least annually and whenever evidence of impairment exists 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and and determined that the goodwill and related intangible assets were not impaired 
we have in the past recorded impairments to our goodwill  however 
as goodwill values are measured using a variety of factors  including values of comparable companies and using overall stock market and economic data  in addition to our own future financial performance  we may be required in the future to record additional impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 

table of contents we may not generate enough income in future periods to maintain the current net carrying value of our deferred tax asset 
we have a deferred tax asset of approximately million  net of an applicable valuation allowance  as of december  if we are unable to generate enough income in future periods  the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset may have to be revised upward  which would reduce the carrying value of this asset on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
an increase in the valuation allowance and a related reduction in the carrying value of this asset would increase our provision for income taxes  thereby reducing net income or increasing net loss  and could reduce our total assets depending on the amount of any such change or changes 
an increase in the valuation allowance could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and or our stockholders equity and financial position 
the recent credit market turmoil may impact our sales to our financial services customers 
recently  many financial services institutions have been forced to record massive write offs on their financial statements to reflect the reduced value of their portfolios of sub prime mortgage loans and or securities derived from these loans 
additionally  financial institutions that are in the business of mortgage lending have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of loan transactions 
all of this turmoil could impact the ability and willingness of our financial services customers to make investments in technology  which may delay or reduce the amount of purchases of our software and professional services by these customers 
material changes to our strategic relationship with oracle usa  inc oracle formerly known as hyperion solutions corporation 
the ranzal business derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a channel relationship with oracle 
this relationship involves oracle assisted lead generation support with respect to the business intelligence services provided by ranzal 
this relationship is governed by an oracle partnernetwork agreement  which is subject to annual renewal and is scheduled to expire in september of a failure to renew this relationship  or a material modification or change in oracle s partner approach or its contract terms  for any reason  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
our reliance upon synapse

service revenue from synapse amounted to million  or of our total service revenues  and million  or of total service revenue  for and  respectively
