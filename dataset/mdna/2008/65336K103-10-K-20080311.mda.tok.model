item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature 
we and mission could also incur additional debt in the future 
the terms of our and mission s senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt 
to the extent we or mission incur additional debt we would become even more susceptible to the leverage related risks described above 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 

table of contents in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios  including consolidated leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios 
future financing agreements may contain similar  or even more restrictive  provisions and covenants 
as a result of these restrictions and covenants  our management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited  and we may be unable to compete effectively  pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
mission s senior credit facility contains similar terms and restrictions 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements  a default may occur 
a default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
a default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt 
mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
mission owns and operates television stations as of december  we have entered into local service agreements with mission  pursuant to which we provide services to mission s stations 
in return for the services we provide  we receive substantially all of the available cash  after payment of debt service costs  generated by mission s stations 
we also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
the sole shareholder of mission has granted to us a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or the amount of its indebtedness 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over the programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
as a result  mission s sole shareholder and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and  as a consequence  the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with mission 
for instance  we may disagree with mission s programming decisions  which programming may prove unpopular and or may generate less advertising revenue 
furthermore  subject to mission s agreement with its lenders  mission s sole shareholder could choose to pay himself a dividend 
the revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks  stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market 
as a result  it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations 
all of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements stations have primary affiliation agreements with nbc  with cbs  with abc  with fox  with mynetworktv and with the cw 
each of nbc  cbs and abc generally provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week  while each of fox  mynetworktv and the cw provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  affiliated stations broadcast the respective network s commercials during the network programming 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  most of the stations we operate or provide services to also receive compensation from these networks 
all of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times beginning in april through september 
table of contents network affiliation agreements are also subject to earlier termination by the networks under limited circumstances 
for more information regarding these network affiliation agreements  see item business network affiliations 
the fcc could decide not to grant renewal of the fcc license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if  during the preceding term  the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
on october   the director of the central illinois chapter of the parents television council ptc submitted an informal objection to the application for renewal of license for nexstar s station wcia in champaign  illinois  requesting the fcc withhold action on wcia s license renewal application until the fcc acts on the ptc s complaint regarding an allegedly indecent broadcast on wcia 
on january   cable america corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for nexstar s station ksfx and mission s station kolr  both licensed to springfield  missouri 
cable america alleged that nexstar s local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
nexstar and mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and cable america submitted a reply 
cable america subsequently requested that the fcc dismiss its petition 
however  the petition remains pending with the fcc 
in september  two subsidiaries of equity broadcasting corporation equity submitted a petition to deny nexstar s applications for renewal of the kfta and knwa fcc licenses 
the petition alleges that nexstar improperly controls mission and its stations 
nexstar subsequently filed its response to the petition 
although nexstar s and mission s management believe that the petitions have no merit  it is not possible to predict what action the fcc will take on the petitions to deny  or when it will take such action 
nexstar and mission began to submit renewal of license applications for their stations beginning in june we and mission expect the fcc to renew the licenses for our stations in due course 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of perry a 
sook  our founder and president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus 
the loss of mr 
sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations 
the television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation  which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial or management 
table of contents resources with which to pursue acquisition targets 
therefore  even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets  we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
fcc rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire additional television stations 
television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if  for example  the fcc or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our rapid growth  our operating results will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth 
since january   we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  having acquired stations and contracted to provide service to additional stations 
we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities 
to manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions  we will need  among other things  to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems 
we will also need to continue to identify  attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel 
failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business 
there are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that we may not be able to successfully reduce costs  increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station  an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities  our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business  we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems  as well as company policies and cultures  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
fcc actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements  which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy 
in some of our markets  we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements 
while these agreements take varying forms  a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner 
by operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market  we and the other station achieve significant operational efficiencies 
we also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market 

table of contents while all of our existing local service agreements comply with fcc rules and policies  the fcc may not continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly type opportunities 
on august   the fcc initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable under its ownership rules 
comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of the fcc has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding 
however  if the fcc adopts a joint sales agreement attribution rule for television stations we will be required to comply with the rule 
cable america corporation and an affiliate of equity separately have alleged that our local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
if the fcc challenges our existing arrangements with mission or our similar arrangements with sinclair broadcasting group  inc sinclair based on these complaints and determines that our arrangements violate the fcc s rules and policies  we may be required to terminate such arrangements and we could be subject to sanctions  fines and or other penalties 
the fcc may decide to terminate grandfathered time brokerage agreements 
the fcc attributes time brokerage agreements and local marketing agreements tbas to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than of a station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  tbas entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests for now 
the fcc will review these grandfathered tbas in the future 
during this review  the fcc may determine to terminate the grandfathered period and make all tbas fully attributable to the programmer 
if the fcc does so  we and mission will be required to terminate the tbas for stations wfxp and khmt unless the fcc simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets 
failure to construct full power dtv facilities may lead to a loss of station coverage area or other fcc sanctions 
television broadcasters are currently broadcasting both analog and dtv signals 
on february   president bush signed into law legislation that establishes february  as the deadline for television broadcasters to complete their transition to dtv only operations and return their analog spectrum to the fcc 
except for stations that have requested waiver of the construction deadline  broadcast television stations are required to have completed construction of their final dtv stations and be broadcasting a full power dtv signal

nexstar s station kard initiated full power dtv broadcasts on january  nexstar s station klbk and mission s station kamc initiated full power dtv broadcasts on february  the fcc has authorized nexstar and mission to operate dtv facilities for its remaining stations at low power until certain dates established by the fcc

the fcc also has established august  as the deadline for nexstar stations ksvi and klst and mission station khmt and has established february  as the deadline for nexstar stations kqtv  wcfn  wjet and whag 
extension requests will be filed with the fcc on or before march  the due date for such filings for the nexstar and mission stations with permit expiration dates of may  unless the stations are scheduled to go dtv full power by the may  deadline 
extension requests will be filed with the fcc on or before june  the due date for such filings for the nexstar and mission stations with permit expiration dates of august  unless the stations are scheduled to go dtv full power by the august  deadline 
all of the nexstar stations with february  dtv construction deadlines are expected to be operating at dtv full power on or before february  
table of contents the level of foreign investments held by our principal stockholder  abry partners  llc and its affiliated funds abry  may limit additional foreign investments made in us 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than us ownership by vote and by equity 
because our majority shareholder  abry has a substantial level of foreign investment  the amount of additional foreign investment that may be made in us is limited to approximately of our total outstanding equity 
the interest of our principal stockholder  abry  in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under fcc rules 
the broadcast or other media interest of our officers  directors and stockholders with or greater voting power are generally attributable under the fcc s rules  which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of otherwise non attributable equity and or debt in a licensee in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or daily newspaper in the same market 
abry  our principal stockholder  is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments 
as a result of abry s interest in us  we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where abry has an attributable interest in television stations or other media  which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our certificate of incorporation allows abry and its affiliates to identify  pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisitions opportunities may not be available to us 
we are controlled by one principal stockholder  abry  and its interests may differ from your interests 
as a result of abry s controlling interest in us  abry is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs 
abry is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  five of our directors are or were affiliated with abry 
abry s interests may differ from the interests of other security holders and abry could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our security holders 
furthermore  this concentration of ownership by abry may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  debt instruments and delaware law contain anti takeover protections that may discourage or prevent a takeover of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us  even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors without a stockholder vote  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and set forth specific advance notice procedures for matters to be raised at stockholder meetings 

table of contents the delaware general corporation law prohibits us from engaging in business combinations with interested shareholders with some exceptions unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of this provision could have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
in addition  a change in control would be an event of default under our senior credit facility and trigger the rights of holders of our publicly traded notes to cause us to repurchase such notes 
these events would add to the cost of an acquisition  which could deter a third party from acquiring us 
we and mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets  and therefore we and mission could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges 
as of december   approximately million  or  of our and mission s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
we and mission test goodwill and fcc licenses annually  and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we and mission test network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows 
the methods used to evaluate the impairment of nexstar s and mission s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of nexstar s and mission s television stations  or a forecast of such reductions  a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which nexstar s and mission s television stations operate  the loss of network affiliations  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among others  which may be beyond our or mission s control 
if the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment  such non cash charge could materially affect nexstar s and mission s financial position and results of operations 
risks related to our industry nexstar s operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result  nexstar may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond nexstar s control than businesses not dependent on advertising 
nexstar derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time 
nexstar s ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond nexstar s control  including the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based media  particularly newspapers  cable television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located 
because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns  the reliance upon advertising revenue makes nexstar s operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership  and we may not achieve 
table of contents favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenue to decline 
in addition  we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate  and effectively react to  shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets 
because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs  primarily for debt service  broadcast rights and personnel 
other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies  our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue 
as a result  a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations 
nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack 
as a result  advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed upon times in the future 
advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods  and space may not be available for such advertising 
the duration of such preemption of local programming cannot be predicted if it occurs 
in addition  our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
the industry wide mandatory conversion to digital television will require us to make significant capital expenditures without assurance that we will remain competitive with other developing technologies 
the conversion from broadcasting in the analog broadcast format to the digital broadcast format is expensive 
this conversion required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station for low power transmission of digital signal programming  and we estimate that it will require an average additional capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations as of december  to modify our and mission s stations dtv transmitters for full power digital signal transmission  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades  replacements and or modifications 
digital conversion expenditures were million  million and million respectively  for the years ended december   and since digital technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum  this technology could expose us to additional competition from programming alternatives 
technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives  such as cable television  dbs systems  pay per view  home video and entertainment systems  video on demand and the internet have created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and will also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
if direct broadcast satellite companies do not carry the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share and revenue 
direct broadcast satellite television companies are permitted to transmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers in local markets provided that they offer to carry all local stations in that market 
however  satellite 
table of contents providers have limited satellite capacity to deliver local station signals in local markets 
satellite providers  such as directv and echostar  carry our and mission s stations in only some of our markets and may choose not to carry local stations in any of our other markets 
directv currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations in the champaign springfield decatur  evansville  ft

in those markets in which the satellite providers do not carry local station signals  subscribers to those satellite services are unable to view local stations without making further arrangements  such as installing antennas and switches 
furthermore  when direct broadcast satellite companies do carry local television stations in a market  they are permitted to charge subscribers extra for such service 
some subscribers may choose not to pay extra to receive local television stations 
in the event subscribers to satellite services do not receive the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share which would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
the fcc can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent 
in  the fcc began to impose substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the communications act and its rules 
the fcc also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television 
because our and mission s stations programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated  we and mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations  and we and mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the fcc finds such programming to be indecent 
in addition  congress recently increased the fines which may be imposed on a television broadcaster for an indecency violation to a maximum of thousand per violation 
intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and impair our ability to become profitable 
as a television broadcasting company  we face a significant level of competition  both directly and indirectly 
generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television 
specifically  stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share  programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media  including newspapers  radio stations  cable television  dbs systems and the internet 
the entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
the markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from  among other things  technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view and home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to increased competition 
we may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions 
we are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future  the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our businesses 

table of contents the fcc could implement legislation and or regulations that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole 
the fcc s ongoing rule making proceeding concerning implementation of the transition from analog to digital television broadcasts is likely to have a significant impact on the television industry and the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to 
the fcc has initiated proceedings to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable interests under its ownership rules  to determine whether it should establish formal rules under which broadcasters will be required to serve the local public interest  and to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules  including the radio television cross ownership rule and the newspaper television cross ownership rule 
a change to any of these rules may have significant impact on us and the stations we provide services to 
in addition  the fcc may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties  any of which might have such an impact 
congress also may act to amend the communications act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general

table of contents executive summary highlights net revenue increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily from the increase in local and national advertising revenue  retransmission compensation and new media revenue  partially offset by a decrease in political advertising revenue 
gross local and national advertising revenue on a combined basis increased million  or  during the year ended december  due in large part to our newly acquired station wtaj as discussed below 
total revenue from the retransmission consent agreements was approximately million for the year ended december  of which approximately million was retransmission compensation and approximately million was advertising revenue generated from the retransmission consent agreements  compared to million for the year ended december  of which approximately million was retransmission compensation and approximately million was advertising revenue generated from the retransmission consent agreements 
new media revenue increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of all markets having implemented this new web based revenue source as of june compared to implementation by only a few initial markets in during the year ended december   repayments totaling million were made to the loans under nexstar s and mission s senior secured credit facilities  of which million were revolving loan repayments and million were scheduled term loan maturities 
on december   we completed our acquisition of wtaj  the cbs affiliate in johnstown altoona  pennsylvania  and wlyh  the cw affiliate in harrisburg lancaster lebanon york  pennsylvania  for total consideration of million  exclusive of transaction costs 
the financial results for wtaj and wlyh are included in  but not in the years prior to overview of operations we owned and operated television stations as of december  through various local service agreements  we programmed or provided sales and other services to additional television stations  including television stations owned and operated by mission as of december  all of the stations that we program or provide sales and other services to  including mission  are owned by independent third parties 
the following table summarizes the various local service agreements we had in effect as of december  with mission service agreements mission stations tba only wfxp and khmt ssa jsa kjtl  kjbo lp  kolr  kcit  kcpn lp  kamc  krbc  ksan  wutr  wfxw  wyou  kode and wtvo we have a time brokerage agreement tba with each of these stations which allows us to program most of each station s broadcast time  sell each station s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to mission 
we have both a shared services agreement ssa and a joint sales agreement jsa with each of these stations 
the ssa allows the sharing of services including news production  technical maintenance and security  in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from mission as described in the ssas 
the jsas permit us to sell and retain a percentage of the net revenue from the station s advertising time in return for monthly payments to mission of the remaining percentage of net revenue  as described in the jsas 
in conjunction with mission s acquisition of ktve  the nbc affiliate in the monroe  louisiana el dorado  arkansas market  effective january   it entered into a ssa and jsa with nexstar 
the terms of the ssa and jsa are comparable to the terms of the ssas and jsas between nexstar and mission as discussed above 

table of contents our ability to receive cash from mission is governed by these agreements 
the arrangements under the ssas and jsas have had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash  after debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
the arrangements under the tbas have also had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash generated by the tba stations listed above 
we anticipate that  through these local service agreements  we will continue to receive substantially all of the available cash  after payments for debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
we also guarantee the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility 
similarly  mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes we have issued 
in consideration of our guarantee of mission s senior credit facility  the sole shareholder of mission has granted us a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement  or the amount of its indebtedness 
these option agreements which expire on various dates between and are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by the sole shareholder of mission 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
the operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from broadcast advertising revenue  which is affected by a number of factors  including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate  the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks 
for the years ended december  and  revenue generated from local advertising represented and  respectively  of our consolidated spot revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue 
the remaining advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising 
all national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies 
the agencies receive a commission rate of of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them 
while the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies  some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations local sales staff  thereby eliminating the agency commission 
each station also has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for sales representation outside the particular station s market 
advertising schedules received through the national representative firm are for national or large regional accounts that advertise in several markets simultaneously 
national commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station s agreement 
each of our stations and the stations we provide services to has a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the station during specified time periods  including prime time 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  most of our stations and the stations we provide services to receive cash compensation for distributing the network s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods 
the affiliation agreements with fox  mynetworktv and the cw do not provide for compensation 
in recent years  in conjunction with the renewal of affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  the amount of network compensation has been declining from year to year 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
therefore  revenue associated with network compensation agreements is expected to decline in future years and may be eliminated altogether at some point in time 
each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non news and non network time periods 
the licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and or the program distributor is allowed to sell 
table of contents some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license 
the latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights 
the station records the estimated fair market value of the licenses  including any advertising inventory given to the program distributor  as a broadcast right asset and liability 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged using historical advertising rates  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the assets are amortized as a component of amortization of broadcast rights 
amortization is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the cash broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments while the barter liability is amortized over the life of the contract as barter revenue 
our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue  employee compensation and related benefits  newsgathering and programming costs 
a large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remains relatively fixed 
seasonality advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies  national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
because television broadcast stations rely on advertising revenue  declines in advertising budgets  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry  and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
the stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years resulting from political advertising and advertising aired during the olympic games 
industry trends the television bureau of advertising has forecasted us television spot advertising revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue in to increase by approximately to compared to our net revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a combined net increase in gross local and national advertising revenue of million which includes million in related to our newly acquired television station wtaj  an increase of million during related to retransmission compensation and an increase of million during related to new media revenue 
these increases were partially offset by the loss of advertising revenue generated during the coverage of the olympic games in and a decrease in political advertising revenue in due to the decline in the volume of advertising time purchased by campaigns for elective offices and for political issues 
political advertising revenue was million for the year ended december   a significant decrease from the million for the year ended december  the demand for political advertising is generally higher in even numbered years  when congressional and presidential elections occur  than in odd numbered years when there are no federal elections scheduled 
during an election year  political advertising revenue makes up a significant portion of the increase in revenue in that year 
since was an election year  a significant percentage of the company s revenue growth in was attributable to political revenue 
however  even during an election year  political revenue is influenced by geography and the competitiveness of the election races 
since is another election year  we expect a significant increase in the political advertising revenue to be reported in in relation to the amount of political advertising reported in automotive related advertising  our largest advertising category  represented approximately and of our core local and national advertising revenue for the years ended december  and 
table of contents respectively 
our automotive related advertising was relatively flat for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in automotive related advertising on a quarter to quarter comparison to the prior year has generally followed a downward trend over the last two years 
this trend has been primarily due to the current condition of the automotive industry and resulting decline in the demand for advertising from this business category 
a continued pattern of deterioration in advertising revenue from this source could materially affect our future results of operations 
station acquisitions on january   mission completed its acquisition of wtvo  the abc affiliate in rockford  illinois  for total consideration of million  exclusive of transaction costs 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  mission made an initial payment of million against the purchase price on november  to acquire substantially all of the assets of wtvo  except for its fcc license and certain transmission equipment

refinancing of long term debt obligations on april   we entered into a senior credit facility agreement which replaced our previous credit facility agreement 
our senior credit facility consists of a term loan b and a million revolving loan as revised on december  
all borrowings outstanding under this credit facility are due to mature in the term loan  which matures in october  is payable in consecutive quarterly installments amortized at quarterly which commenced on december   with the remaining due at maturity 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a base rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  libor plus an applicable margin 
as a result of the refinancing  the applicable margin component of the revolving loan was decreased by basis points  representing

mission also entered into a senior credit facility agreement on april  which replaced its previous credit facility 
mission s credit facility consists of a term loan b and a million revolving loan as revised on december  
terms of the mission credit facility  including maturity and interest rates  are the same as the terms of our credit facility 
also on april   we redeemed all our outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes notes that were due to mature on april   at a price of  per 
table of contents  principal amount 
redemption of the notes was funded from proceeds obtained through a combination of an offering of senior subordinated notes as discussed below and senior secured credit facility financing 
the aggregate redemption payment of million plus accrued interest made on april  included a million call premium related to the retirement of the notes 
the redemption of the notes resulted in the recognition of a loss in the second quarter of consisting of million in call premium and the write off of approximately million of previously capitalized debt financing costs and accelerated amortization of million of unamortized discount on the notes 
in conjunction with the redemption  we recorded a gain during the second quarter of of approximately million from the write off of a fair value hedge adjustment of the carrying amount of the notes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no

 as amended 
additionally  on april   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes at a price of notes due the notes were issued as an add on to the million aggregate principal amount of our previously issued notes

table of contents income taxes income taxes decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to a million reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities position resulting from enactment of the new texas margin tax in the second quarter of and the recognition of a million benefit from a prior year tax position in the third quarter of our provision for income taxes is primarily created by an increase in the deferred tax liabilities position during the year arising from the amortizing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
no tax benefit was recorded with respect to the losses for and  as the utilization of such losses is not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources we and mission are highly leveraged  which makes the company vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions 
our and mission s ability to meet the future cash requirements described below depends on our and mission s ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our and mission s control 
based on current operations and anticipated future growth  we believe that our and mission s available cash  anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements  interest payments and scheduled debt principal payments for at least the next twelve months 
in order to meet future cash needs we may  from time to time  borrow under credit facilities or issue other long or short term debt or equity  if the market and the terms of our existing debt arrangements permit  and mission may  from time to time  borrow under its available credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate the best use of nexstar s operating cash flow among its capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt reduction

nexstar and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
mission files its own separate federal income tax return 
additionally  nexstar and mission file their own state and local tax returns as are required 
due to our and mission s recent history of net operating losses  we and mission currently do not pay any federal income taxes 
these net operating losses may be carried forward  subject to expiration and certain limitations  and used to reduce taxable earnings in future years 
through the use of available loss carryforwards  it is possible that we and mission may not pay significant amounts of federal income taxes in the foreseeable future 
cash flows investing activities the comparative net cash used for investing activities decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in purchases of property and equipment and in acquisition related payments 
the comparative net cash used for investing activities increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in cash flows from investing activities for and consisted primarily of cash used for capital additions and station acquisitions 
the increase was due to increases in purchases of property and equipment and acquisition related payments

acquisition related payments for the year ended december  included the remaining payments of million and million  exclusive of transaction costs  for mission s acquisition of wtvo and our acquisition of kfta knwa  respectively 
cash flows financing activities the comparative net cash from financing activities decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  due to the decrease in the proceeds during from revolving loan borrowings under our and mission s senior secured credit facilities and the increase in repayments during under our and mission s senior secured credit facilities 
the comparative net cash provided by financing activities increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to the million increase in proceeds from revolving loan borrowings under our and mission s senior secured credit facilities and by payments of debt financing costs of million made in connection with the april refinancing of our and mission s long term debt obligations 
during the year ended december   there were million of revolving loan borrowings related to the wtaj and wlyh acquisition compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was partially offset by the amount of net proceeds received from refinancing our and mission s long term debt obligations in april and an increase in repayments during under our and mission s senior secured credit facilities 
the april refinancing of our and mission s long term debt obligations provided the company net cash proceeds of million  before the payment of transaction fees and expenses  consisting of gross proceeds obtained under senior credit facility term loans and our issuance of notes of million and the repayments of previous senior credit facility term and revolving borrowings and our notes of million

although the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities now allow for the payment of cash dividends to common stockholders  we and mission do not currently intend to declare or pay a cash dividend 
future sources of financing and debt service requirements as of december   nexstar and mission had total combined debt of million  which represented of nexstar and mission s combined capitalization 
our and mission s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness undiscounted scheduled to mature for the periods referenced as of december  total thereafter in thousands nexstar senior credit facility mission senior credit facility senior subordinated notes due senior discount notes due on april   nexstar is required to redeem a principal amount of senior discount notes notes outstanding sufficient to ensure that the notes will not be applicable high yield discount obligations within the meaning of section i of the internal revenue code 
this principal payment will be million and will be funded with cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its senior secured credit facility 
we make semiannual interest payments on our notes of million on january th and july th of each year 
the notes will not begin to accrue cash interest until april  commencing october  we will make semiannual interest payments on our notes on april st and october st of each year 
interest payments on our and mission s senior credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months and are payable based on the type of interest rate selected 
the terms of the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities  as well as of the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit  us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 

table of contents debt covenants our bank credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a maximum total and senior leverage ratios  b a minimum interest coverage ratio  and c a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are formally calculated on a quarterly basis  are based on the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
the senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type 
mission s bank credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  but does provide for default in the event nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement 
as of december  and throughout the corresponding year  we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the publicly held notes 
we anticipate compliance with all the covenants through december  for a discussion of the financial ratio requirements of these covenants  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
on april   we are required to redeem a principal amount of our million senior discount notes notes outstanding which will be sufficient to ensure that the notes will not be applicable high yield discount obligations within the meaning of section i of the internal revenue code 
this principal payment is approximately million and we expect to fund the payment with cash generated from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
effective on april  under our bank credit facility agreement  we are required to include the remaining principal balance of nexstar finance holdings notes in the calculation of our total leverage ratio 
accordingly  as of june   the outstanding principal of million on the notes will be included as debt outstanding in this covenant compliance ratio 
given the impact of including the notes in our june  total leverage ratio  we are currently pursuing certain initiatives to enhance our ability to comply with this june  covenant 
these initiatives included modifying certain vendor payment terms which will have a more favorable impact on our cash flows relative to covenant calculations  prior to june  we also have repositioned approximately million of capital expenditures originally planned for the first six months of into the last six months of in addition  we believe that we have certain other cash management and cost containment measures that could be implemented by the management team to ensure compliance with our covenants at june  notwithstanding the operational initiatives described above  we would also have the ability to seek a debt covenant waiver from our lenders 
cash requirements for digital television dtv conversion television broadcasting in the united states is moving from an analog transmission system to a digital transmission system 
the conversion from broadcasting in the analog format to the digital format is expensive 
the company s conversion to a low power dtv signal required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station 
all of the television stations that we and mission own and operate are broadcasting at least a low power digital television signal 
except for stations that have requested waiver of the construction deadline  broadcast television stations are required to have completed construction of their final dtv stations and be broadcasting a full power dtv signal 
as of december   mission s stations wutr  wtvo  wyou  kolr and krbc and nexstar s stations wbre  wroc  kark  knwa  kfta  wmbd  wtaj  wlyh  ksfx  wqrf  ktal  wcia  wtvw and ktab are broadcasting with full power dtv signals 
nexstar s station kard initiated full power dtv broadcasts on january  nexstar s station klbk and mission s station kamc initiated full power dtv broadcasts on february  the fcc has authorized nexstar and mission to operate dtv facilities for 
table of contents its remaining stations at low power until certain dates established by the fcc 
the fcc has established may  as the deadline for nexstar stations kamr  kbtv  kfdx  wdhn  wfft  wfxv  wtwo  kmid and ksnf and mission stations kjtl  kcit  ksan  wfxw  wfxp and kode 
the fcc also has established august  as the deadline for nexstar stations ksvi and klst and mission station khmt and has established february  as the deadline for nexstar stations kqtv  wcfn  wjet and whag 
extension requests will be filed with the fcc on or before march  the due date for such filings for the nexstar and mission stations with permit expiration dates of may  unless the stations are scheduled to go dtv full power by the may  deadline 
extension requests will be filed with the fcc on or before june  the due date for such filings for the nexstar and mission stations with permit expiration dates of august  unless the stations are scheduled to go dtv full power by the august  deadline 
all of the nexstar stations with february  dtv construction deadlines are expected to be operating at dtv full power on or before february  dtv conversion expenditures were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and we estimate that it will require an average capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations as of december  to modify our and mission s remaining stations dtv transmitting equipment for full power dtv operations  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades and or modifications 
we anticipate these expenditures will be funded through available cash on hand and cash generated from operations as incurred in future years 
no off balance sheet arrangements at december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our arrangements with mission are on balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

table of contents as discussed in note  income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
as of january  at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the corporation has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
the resolution of these tax positions may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  bad debts  broadcast rights  trade and barter  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
for an overview of our significant accounting policies  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
consolidation of mission and variable interest entities our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of independently owned mission and certain other entities when it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie in accordance with fin no 
under us gaap  a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights 
fin no 
r expands the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights 
in applying fin no 
r  we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entity s economic rewards 
our evaluation of the risks and rewards model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change 
mission is included in our consolidated financial statements because we believe we have a controlling financial interest in mission as a result of local service agreements we have with each of mission s stations  our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and purchase options which expire on various dates between and granted by mission s sole shareholder which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration 
in addition  generally in connection with acquisitions  the company enters into time brokerage agreements tba and begins programming and selling advertising for a station before receiving fcc consent to the transfer of the station s ownership and broadcast license 
we include a station programmed under a tba in our consolidated financial statements because we believe that we have a controlling financial interest in the station as a result of the company assuming the credit risk of advertising revenue it sells on the station  its obligation to pay for substantially all the station s reasonable operating expenses  as required under the tba agreement  and in connection with our entry into a purchase agreement  that the sale of the station and transfer of the station s broadcast license will occur within a reasonable period of time 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and intangible assets the process of establishing the value of goodwill and intangible assets and performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and broadcast licenses fcc licenses requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in determining a fair value based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted cash flows analysis 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of appraisal and valuation consulting firms 
the assumptions and estimates required for the discounted cash flows analysis included market revenue share  future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  weighted average cost of capital and our ability to renew affiliation contracts  among others 
the value of fcc licenses is determined assuming a hypothetical independent start up station whose only intangible asset is the fcc license 
the value of network affiliation agreements is determined as the difference between the value derived for the hypothetical independent start up station and the value derived assuming that the start up station has a network affiliation 
we test the impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment tests consist of a comparison of the assets fair value  based on a discounted cash flows analysis  to their carrying amount on a market by market basis 
the projected future cash flows used to test fcc licenses exclude network compensation payments 
our estimate of future cash flows may be significantly impacted due to an adverse change in the advertising marketplace or other economic factors affecting our industry at the time the impairment tests are performed 
nexstar and mission completed the annual test of impairment for goodwill and fcc licenses as of december   and  which resulted in no impairment being recognized in  and we test network affiliation agreements for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
the process we use for determining the recoverability of network affiliation agreements is subjective and requires us to make estimates and judgments about the cash flows attributable to the network affiliation agreements over their estimated remaining useful lives 
management has determined that years is a reasonable estimated useful life 
an impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the operation to which the asset relates to is less than its carrying value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
broadcast rights carrying amount broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
cash broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors programming 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the programming received 
the value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical rates for specific time periods 
amortization of broadcast rights is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or programming usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for 
table of contents broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year 
when projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights  for example  due to poor ratings  we write down the unamortized cost of the broadcast rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenue 
if the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled we would be required to write off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately 
as of december   the amounts of current broadcast rights and non current broadcast rights were million and million  respectively 
trade and barter transactions we trade certain advertising time for various goods and services 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
we barter advertising time for certain program material 
these transactions  except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming  are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
we recorded barter revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade revenue of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred trade and barter expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
on january   we adopted fin no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for interest and penalties relating to income taxes we recognize these items as components of income tax expense 
stock option expense recognition effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
we recognize the expense related to our stock options over the period that the employee is required to provide services  and only to the extent the awards vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate assumption to adjust compensation cost for the effect of those employees that are not expected to complete the requisite service period and will forfeit nonvested options 
we base the forfeiture rate assumption on nexstar s historical experience of award forfeitures  and as necessary  adjusted for certain events that are not expected to recur during the expected term of the option 

table of contents we determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
our valuation of employee stock options relies on assumptions of factors we are required to input into the black scholes model 
these assumptions are highly subjective and involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
the option pricing model requires us to input factors for expected stock price volatility and the expected term until exercise of the option award 
due to our limited history of publicly traded shares  we combine our historical stock price data and volatilities of peer companies in the television broadcasting industry when determining expected volatility 
based on a lack of historical option exercise experience  we use the weighted average of the holding periods for all options granted to determine the expected term assumption 
utilizing historical exercise and post vesting cancellation experience of nexstar s stock option awards  the expected term is the average interval between the grant and exercise or post vesting cancellation dates 
claims and loss contingencies in the normal course of business  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated 
we consider a combination of factors when estimating probable losses  including judgments about potential actions by counterparties 
nonmonetary asset exchanges in connection with a spectrum allocation exchange ordered by the fcc within the ghz band  sprint nextel corporation nextel is required to replace certain existing analog equipment with comparable digital equipment 
the company has agreed to accept the substitute equipment that nextel will provide and in turn must relinquish its existing equipment to nextel 
neither party will have any continuing involvement in the equipment transferred following the exchange 
we account for this arrangement as an exchange of assets in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  as amended by sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the equipment received 
we derive our estimate of fair market value from the most recent prices paid to manufacturers and vendors for the specific equipment we acquire 
as equipment is exchanged  the company records a gain to the extent that the fair market value of the equipment received exceeds the carrying amount of the equipment relinquished 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which addresses how companies should determine fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
under sfas no 
 the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value  but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  which is the company s fiscal year

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb no 
sfas no 
 which provides a fair value measurement option for eligible financial assets and liabilities 
under sfas no 
 an entity is permitted to elect to apply fair value accounting to a single eligible item  subject to certain exceptions  without electing it for other identical items and include unrealized gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value option established by this statement is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
this standard reduces the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and mitigates volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently
