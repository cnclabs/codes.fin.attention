item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion and analysis below includes certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in risk factors under item a and elsewhere in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected in  or implied by  those forward looking statements 
overview we are a provider of insurance products and services to the specialty commercial insurance markets  primarily focusing on niche and underserved segments where we believe that we have underwriting expertise and other competitive advantages 
during our years of underwriting security risks  we have established coverx as a recognized brand among insurance agents and brokers and have developed significant underwriting expertise and a cost efficient infrastructure 
over the last seven years  we have leveraged our brand  expertise and infrastructure to expand into other specialty classes of business  particularly focusing on smaller accounts that receive less attention from competitors 
first mercury financial corporation fmfc is a holding company for our operating subsidiaries 
our operations are conducted with the goal of producing overall profits by strategically balancing underwriting profits from our insurance subsidiaries with the commissions and fee income generated by our non insurance subsidiaries 
fmfc s principal operating subsidiaries are coverx corporation coverx  first mercury insurance company fmic  all nation insurance company anic  and american risk pooling consultants  inc arpco 
coverx produces and underwrites all of the insurance policies for which we retain risk and receive premiums 
as a wholesale insurance broker  coverx markets our insurance policies through a nationwide network of wholesale and retail insurance brokers who then distribute these policies through retail insurance brokers 
coverx also provides underwriting services with respect to the insurance policies it markets in that it reviews the applications submitted for insurance coverage  decides whether to accept all or part of the coverage requested and determines applicable premiums 
coverx receives commissions from affiliated insurance companies  reinsurers  and non affiliated insurers as well as policy fees from wholesale and retail insurance brokers 
fmic and anic are our two insurance subsidiaries 
fmic writes substantially all the policies produced by coverx 
anic provides reinsurance to fmic 
effective january   fmic and anic entered into an intercompany pooling reinsurance agreement wherein all premiums  losses and expenses of fmic and anic  including all past liabilities  are combined and apportioned between fmic and anic in accordance with fixed percentages 
prior to the change in business model discussed below  fmic and anic primarily provided quota share reinsurance to third party insurance companies that issued policies to coverx customers under fronting arrangements 
fmic also provides claims handling and adjustment services for policies produced by coverx and directly written by third parties 
arpco provides third party administrative services for risk sharing pools of governmental entity risks  including underwriting  claims  loss control and reinsurance services 
arpco is solely a fee based business and receives fees for these services and commissions on excess per occurrence insurance placed in the commercial market with third party companies on behalf of the pools 
holdings transactions and initial public offering on august   we completed a transaction in which we formed a holding company holdings to purchase shares of fmfc common stock from certain fmfc stockholders and to exchange shares and options with the remaining stockholders of fmfc 
as a result of this transaction  glencoe capital llc glencoe became the majority stockholder of holdings and holdings became the controlling stockholder of fmfc 
the purchase and exchange of shares was financed by the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes by holdings 
in october  holdings was merged into fmfc in connection with our initial public offering  and the senior notes were repaid in full with a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 

table of contents as a result of the acquisition and resulting purchase accounting adjustments  the results of operations for periods prior to august  are not comparable to periods subsequent to that date 
our fiscal results discussed below represent the mathematical addition of the historical results for i the predecessor period from january  through august   and ii the successor period from august  through december  this approach is not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and yields results that are not comparable on a period to period basis 
however  we believe it is the most meaningful way to discuss our operating results for when comparing them to our operating results for because it would not be meaningful to discuss the partial period from january  through august  predecessor separately from the period from august  to december  successor when comparing operating results to operating results 
change in business model in june  an investment by glencoe along with additional cash from fmfc  increased fmic s statutory surplus by million 
as a result of this capital infusion  am best raised fmic s financial strength rating to a  and beginning in july  fmic began directly writing the majority of new and renewal policies produced by coverx 
prior to june and our insurance subsidiary s rating upgrade with am best to a  we did not directly write a significant amount of insurance produced by coverx through our insurance subsidiaries  but instead utilized fronting arrangements under which we contracted with third party insurers  or fronting insurers  to directly write the policies underwritten and produced by coverx 
under these fronting arrangements  policies produced by coverx were directly written by third party insurers  which are commonly referred to as fronting insurers 
under these fronting arrangements  we controlled the cession of the insurance from the fronting insurer and either assumed most of the risk under these policies as a reinsurer or arranged for it to be ceded to other reinsurers 
we paid the fronting insurers a fee for this arrangement and were required to maintain collateral grantor trusts to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums 
we entered into fronting arrangements because our customers require an am best rating of a or greater and fmic s am best rating was b prior to the million increase in its statutory surplus 
by utilizing fronting arrangements  we were able to use the availability  capacity and rating status of the fronting insurers to market insurance 
with our insurance subsidiary s rating upgrade  we were able to eliminate most of our fronting relationships by may and become the direct writer of substantially all of the policies produced by coverx 
we currently only use fronting arrangements when they serve our business purpose and coverx has continued to provide broker and general agent services to third party insurers although we do not expect revenues generated from such services to be significant 
as a result of our shift from the fronting model to the direct writing model  fees we paid to fronting insurers and a portion of our administrative expenses related to interacting with fronting insurers were eliminated  which has reduced our expenses 
as a result of the decrease in fronting and administrative expenses  the shift to the direct writing model has increased our profitability 
we are no longer subject to the underwriting and claims oversight of fronting insurers nor are we required to fund collateral grantor trust accounts 
in addition  we are not dependent on the availability  capacity or rating status of fronting insurers 
this change in our business model impacted our operating results and the comparability of to and to operating results in several ways  including the following direct  assumed and ceded written premiums the elimination of the fronting arrangement resulted in an increase in our direct written premiums because we no longer relied on fronting insurers to directly write insurance that we then reinsured or placed with other reinsurers 
the increase in our direct written premiums resulted in a corresponding decrease in our assumed written premiums  and an increase in our ceded written premiums from to net written and earned premiums the change in business model did not have a significant impact on our net written or earned premiums 
insurance underwriting commissions under the fronting model  we received fixed rate commission income on all premiums produced by coverx for fronting insurers  as well as profit sharing commission 
table of contents income on all premiums produced that were retained by fronting insurers or ceded to third party insurers 
under the direct writing model  we do not report commission income on premiums written by our insurance subsidiaries because they are eliminated for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the change in our business model therefore resulted in a decrease of our insurance underwriting commission income from to assumed reinsurance commission expense under the fronting model  other operating expenses included fixed commissions incurred under assumed reinsurance agreements with the fronting insurers  and  in some cases  profit sharing expense incurred related to assumed reinsurance agreements 
the fronting fees charged to us by the fronting insurers were added to the commission expenses incurred or were deducted from the fixed commissions earned by coverx 
the change in our business model therefore resulted in a decrease of our assumed reinsurance commission expense from to ceded reinsurance commissions under the direct writing model  we earn ceding commissions on insurance risks ceded from fmic to third party insurers under reinsurance treaties and earn ceded profit sharing commissions on ceded reinsurance 
under the fronting model  these ceding commissions were paid to the fronting insurer by the reinsurers who received the corresponding premiums 
both of these items are reported as an offset to our other operating expenses 
the change in our business model resulted in an increase in our ceded reinsurance commissions from to our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read with an understanding of this change in our business model 
premiums produced we use the operational measure premiums produced to identify premiums generated from insurance policies sold through coverx on insurance policies that it produces and underwrites on behalf of fmic and under fronting relationships 
premiums produced includes both our direct written premiums and premiums directly written by our fronting insurers  all of which are produced and underwritten by coverx 
although the premiums underwritten by coverx under fronting relationships are directly written by the fronting insurer  we control the ultimate placement of those premiums  by either assuming the premiums by our insurance subsidiaries or arranging for the premiums to be ceded to third party reinsurers 
the operational measure premiums produced is used by our management  reinsurers  creditors and rating agencies as a meaningful measure of the dollar growth of our underwriting operations because it represents the premiums that we control by directly writing insurance and by our fronting relationships 
it is also a key indicator of our insurance underwriting operations revenues  and is the basis for broker commission expense calculations in our consolidated income statement 
we generate direct and net earned premium income from premiums directly written by our insurance subsidiaries  and generate commission income  profit sharing commission income and assumed written and earned premiums from premiums directly written by third party insurance companies 
we believe that premiums produced is an important operational measure of our insurance underwriting operations  and refer to it in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of our operations 
critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  and revenues and expenses reported for the periods then ended 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are susceptible to significant change in the near term relate primarily to the determination of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our estimated ultimate costs of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date 
our reserves reflect our estimates at a given time of amounts that we expect to pay for losses that have been reported  which are referred to as case reserves  and losses that have been incurred but not reported and the expected development of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses on open reported cases  which are referred to as ibnr reserves 
we do not discount the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we allocate the applicable portion of our estimated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to amounts recoverable from reinsurers under ceded reinsurance contracts and report those amounts separately from our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as an asset on our balance sheet 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are our estimates based upon various factors  including actuarial projections of what we  at a given time  expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  assessment of asserted theories of liability  and analysis of other factors  such as variables in claims handling procedures  economic factors  and judicial and legislative trends and actions 
most or all of these factors are not directly or precisely quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis  and are subject to a significant degree of variability over time 
in addition  the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves makes no provision for the broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation or for the extraordinary future emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in our historical experience or which cannot yet be quantified 
accordingly  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimate is revised 
our reserves consist of reserves for property and liability losses  consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by the company under reinsurance contracts 
in many cases  several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are estimates 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions and may  in fact  vary significantly from our assumptions 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
we continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
when a claim is reported to us  our claims department completes a case basis valuation and establishes a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment as soon as practicable after receiving notice of a claim and after it has sufficient information to form a judgment about the probable ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with that claim 
we take into consideration the facts and circumstances for each claim filed as then known by our claims department  as well as actuarial estimates of aggregate unpaid losses and loss expenses based on our experience and industry data  and expected future trends in loss costs 
the amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense for 
table of contents reported claims  which we refer to as case reserves  is based primarily upon a claim by claim evaluation of coverage  and an evaluation of the following factors the type of loss  the severity of injury or damage  our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  policy provisions related to the claim  expenses intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims  including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims  costs of outside adjusters and experts  and all other expenses which are identified to the case  and any other information considered pertinent to estimating the indemnity and expense exposure presented by the claim 
our claims department updates their case basis valuations continuously to incorporate new information 
we also use actuarial analyses to estimate both the costs of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred but not reported to us and the expected development of costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses on open reported cases 
we determine ibnr reserve estimates separately for our security classes and for our other specialty classes  since we have extensive historical experience data on the security classes and limited historical experience data for our other specialty classes 
for security classes  our ibnr reserve estimates are determined using our actual historical loss and loss adjustment expense experience and reporting patterns from our loss and loss adjustment expense database which covers the last years 
for other specialty classes  for which we have seven years or less of historical data  our estimates give significant weight to industry loss and loss adjustment expense costs and industry reporting patterns applicable to our classes  from industry sources including actuarial circulars published by insurance services offices iso in combination with our actual paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses and reporting patterns 
our estimates also include estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of potential future claims 
we also estimate bulk reserves for our unallocated loss adjustment expenses not specifically identified to a particular claim  namely our internal claims department salaries and associated general overhead and administrative expenses associated with the adjustment and processing of claims 
these estimates  which are referred to as ulae reserves  are based on internal cost studies and analyses reflecting the relationship of unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid to actual paid and incurred losses 
we select factors that are applied to case reserves and to ibnr reserve estimates in order to estimate the amount of unallocated loss reserves applicable to estimated loss reserves at the balance sheet date 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at december    and  gross and net of ceded reinsurance were as follows december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves ibnr and ulae reserves total reserves net of reinsurance case reserves ibnr and ulae reserves total 
table of contents we utilize accepted actuarial methods to arrive at our loss and loss adjustment expense ibnr reserve estimates 
the determination of our best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses and ibnr reserves requires significant actuarial analysis and judgment  both in application of these methods and in the use of the results of these methods 
the principal methods we use include the loss development method based on paid and reported losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss and loss adjustment expense reporting and payment and reporting patterns  the bornhuetter ferguson method based on paid and reported losses and loss adjustment expenses  expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  and loss and loss adjustment expense reporting and payment and reporting patterns  the cape cod method expected losses for one policy year being estimated based on the loss results for the other policy years  trended to the level of the policy year being estimated  and the expected loss ratio method based on historical or industry experience  adjusted for changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions and estimated loss cost trends 
our estimates for security classes and other specialty classes give different weight to each of these methods based upon the amount of historical experience data we have and our judgments as to what method we believe will result in the most accurate estimate 
the application of each method for security classes and other specialty classes may change in the future if we determine a different emphasis for each method would result in more accurate estimates 
we apply these methods to net paid and incurred loss and loss adjustment expense and net earned premium information after ceding reinsurance to determine ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense and net ibnr reserves 
we determine our ceded ibnr reserves applicable to quota share reinsurance based on the ultimate net loss and loss adjustment expense ratios determined in the estimation of our net ibnr reserves 
ceded ibnr reserves applicable to excess of loss reinsurance are based on industry and company experience factors applicable to the excess coverage layers 
ceded case reserves are allocated based on monthly or quarterly reinsurance settlement reports prepared in accordance with the reporting and settlement terms of the ceded reinsurance contracts 
for security classes where we have many years of historical experience data  we perform semi annual analyses of the payment and reporting patterns of losses and loss adjustment expenses as well as reported and closed claims by accident year for security guard  alarm  and safety equipment sub classes 
we have generally relied primarily on the loss development method in calculating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses for the more mature accident years  applying our historical loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns to paid and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reported to date by accident year to estimate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense and ibnr reserves 
our reserve estimates for the more recent  less mature accident years have relied more on the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod methods to calculate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense and ibnr reserves 
although we have calculated the results from the expected loss ratio method for the less mature years  we have not relied significantly on this method due to the more meaningful results of the other methods we have used for security classes 
for other specialty classes  we have relied primarily on the bornhuetter ferguson method in calculating our semi annual reserve estimates 
although we use the loss development method  we have not relied significantly on it as we are still building our experience database for other specialty classes 
we have also used the expected loss ratio method  which we have developed from industry loss cost information  adjusted for changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions  and estimated loss cost trends 
we have seven years or less of historical experience of losses and loss adjustment expenses for other specialty classes  so we have relied on both our own historical experience and industry reporting patterns included in actuarial circulars published by insurance services offices iso by sub class groupings that are consistent with our class profiles within our other specialty classes 
from through  our reserve estimates for other specialty classes utilized industry loss and loss adjustment expense reporting pattern information that was included in actuarial circulars available from iso in new  updated iso industry loss and loss adjustment expense reporting pattern information became available during which was more detailed for each of the sub class groupings within other specialty classes 
the new 
table of contents industry information reflected higher and slower loss reporting patterns than the industry information that was previously available 
this was due to a number of factors  including more recent data  additional data from different sources and more detailed segmentation of the data 
during  we compared the new industry reporting pattern information to our actual loss experience and have determined that the new information more closely aligned with our emerging experience  coverage class groupings and limits profiles for other specialty classes 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we adopted usage of the new industry loss reporting pattern information in our reserve estimates for all accident years  resulting in increases in prior years reserves  and in higher and later accident year reserve estimates 
our reserve analysis determines an actuarial point estimate rather than a range of reserve estimates 
we do not compute estimated ranges of loss reserves 
because of the inherent variability in liability losses  point estimates using appropriate actuarial methods and reasonable assumptions provide the best estimate of reserves 
we review loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on a quarterly basis 
actuarial loss reserves analyses and reports are prepared and are reviewed by management for all business classes and accident years on a semi annual basis as of june and december annual actuarial statements of opinion on the reserves of our insurance subsidiaries are also prepared as of december  in accordance with insurance regulatory requirements 
the carried reserves reflect management s best estimate of the outstanding losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities after review of the actuarial analyses and statements of opinion 
during the first two quarters of an accident year  for both security classes and other specialty classes  we have used the expected loss ratio method based on the previous year end estimates for the previous accident year  adjusted for estimated changes in premium rates  coverage restrictions and estimated loss cost trends 
we monitor emerging loss experience monthly and make adjustments to the current accident year expected loss ratio as we believe appropriate 
throughout the year we also compare actual emerging loss development on prior accident years to expected loss development included in our prior accident years loss reserve estimates and make quarterly interim adjustments to prior years reserve estimates during interim reporting periods as we believe appropriate 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are estimates 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions 
the most significant assumptions affecting our ibnr reserve estimates are expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  and expected loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns 
these vary by underwriting class  sub classes  and accident years  and are subject to uncertainty and variability with respect to any individual accident year and sub class 
generally  the reserves for the most recent accident years depend heavily on both assumptions 
the most recent accident years are characterized by more unreported losses and less information available for settling claims  and have more inherent uncertainty than the reserve estimates for more mature accident years 
the more mature accident years depend more on expected loss and loss expense reporting patterns 
the following sensitivity analysis represents reasonably likely levels of variability in these assumptions in the aggregate 
individual classes and sub classes and accident years have different degrees of variability in both assumptions and it is not reasonably likely that each assumption for each sub class and accident year would vary in the same direction and to the same extent in the same reporting period 
we believe the most meaningful approach to the sensitivity analysis is to vary the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates that result from application of the assumptions 
we apply this approach on an accident year basis  reflecting the reasonably likely differences in variability by level of maturity of the underlying loss experience for each accident year  using variability factors of plus or minus for the most recent accident year  for the preceding accident year  and for the second preceding accident year 
there is minimal expected variability for accident years at four or more years maturity 
the following table includes net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense amounts by accident year from our statutory filing for our insurance subsidiaries for the year ended december   which are equal to the net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense amounts by accident year included in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates in the consolidated financial statements at december  the use of net of ceded reinsurance amounts is most meaningful since the vast majority of our ceded reinsurance is on a quota share basis 
we have applied the sensitivity factors to each accident year amount and have calculated the amount of potential net reserve change and the impact on reported pre tax income and on net income and stockholders equity at 
table of contents december  we do not believe it is appropriate to sum the illustrated amounts as it is not reasonably likely that each accident year s reserve estimate assumptions will vary simultaneously in the same direction to the full extent of the sensitivity factor

premiums are recognized as earned using the daily pro rata method over the terms of the policies 
when premium rates increase  the effect of those increases will not immediately affect earned premium 
rather  those increases will be recognized ratably over the period of coverage 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that relate to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
as policies expire  we audit those policies comparing the estimated premium rating units that were used to set the initial premium to the actual premiums rating units for the period and adjust the premiums accordingly 
premium adjustments identified as a result of these audits are recognized as earned when identified 
commissions and fees 
wholesale agency commissions and fee income from unaffiliated companies are earned at the effective date of the related insurance policies produced or as services are provided under the terms of the administrative and service provider contracts 
related commissions to retail agencies are concurrently expensed at the effective date of the related insurance policies produced 
profit sharing commissions due from certain insurance companies  based on losses and loss adjustment expense experience  are earned when determined and communicated by the applicable insurance company 
investments our marketable investment securities  including money market accounts held in our investment portfolio  are classified as available for sale and  as a result  are reported at market value 
a decline in the market value of any security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings and results in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
in most cases  declines in market value that are deemed temporary are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of the related taxes  until realized 
the exception of this rule relates to investments in convertible securities with embedded derivatives 
these convertible securities were accounted for under sfas no 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas for the year ended december  and under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas for the year ended december  premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related debt security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs related to direct and assumed premiums consist of commissions  underwriting  policy issuance  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  and are deferred  subject to ultimate recoverability  and expensed over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
investment income is included in the calculation of ultimate recoverability 
intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets that are not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test shall consist of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred relative to a given asset or assets 
impairment is deemed to have occurred if projected undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimated cash flows include management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
the amount of the impairment loss recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its then estimated fair value

however  we believe it is the most meaningful way to discuss our operating results for when comparing them to our operating results for because it would not be meaningful to discuss the partial period from january  through august  predecessor separately from the period from august  to december  successor 
the following table summarizes our results for the years ended december  and year ended december  change dollars in thousands operating revenue net earned premiums commissions and fees net investment income net realized gains on investments total operating revenues operating expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses  net amortization of intangible assets other operating expenses total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income loss ratio points underwriting expense ratio points combined ratio points premiums produced premiums produced  which consists of all of the premiums billed by coverx  for the year ended december   were million  a million or increase over million in premiums produced during the year ended december  this growth was primarily attributable to approximately million in net new business  including a full year of operations in the northeast and the legal professional liability program  and continued growth in existing markets  million increase in premiums on the audit of expiring policies 

table of contents operating revenue net earned premiums year ended december  change dollars in thousands written premiums direct assumed ceded net written premiums earned premiums direct assumed ceded earned but unbilled premiums net earned premiums direct written premiums increased million  or while direct earned premiums increased million  or in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increases in direct written premiums and direct earned premiums were due primarily to the change in our business model as a result of which we ceased relying on fronting arrangements under which we assumed insurance from fronting insurers and instead began to write substantially all of the new and renewal policies produced by coverx 
as of december   we had the benefit of a full year of direct written premiums with minimal fronting  which resulted in direct earned premiums increasing at a higher rate than direct written premiums 
as of december   while the change in business model had been in effect for a full year  the first six months after the change was more of a gradual shift away from fronting towards directly writing policies and as such  there were lower volumes of policies to be earned as of december  assumed written premiums decreased million  or  and assumed earned premiums decreased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these decreases were consistent with the change in our business model as a result of which we ceased relying on fronting arrangements under which we assumed insurance from fronting insurers and instead began to directly write substantially all of our premiums produced 
ceded written premiums increased million  or  and ceded earned premiums increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in premiums produced as well as elections to increase premiums ceded under our current quota share arrangement by to in january this increase was offset by the return to the company of million in ceded written premiums on december  as a result of the company s exercise of its election to terminate expiring quota share reinsurance contracts on a cut off basis  in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
the million in returned premiums was earned by the company and reported as net earned premiums during the time lag between ceded premiums being written and ceded premiums being earned resulted in a more substantial increase in the ceded earned premiums 

table of contents commissions and fees year ended december  change dollars in thousands insurance underwriting commissions and fees insurance services commissions and fees total commissions and fees insurance underwriting commissions and fees decreased million or from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this was primarily the result of the change in our business model  which resulted in an increase in direct written premiums as a percentage of premiums produced  and insurance underwriting commissions and fees decreased 
this decline was offset by the impact of the increase in premiums produced 
insurance services commissions and fees  which were principally arpco income and not related to premiums produced  increased million  or 
net investment income and realized gains on investments during the year ended december   net investment income earned was million  a million  or increase from million reported in the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in invested assets over the period 
at december   invested assets were million  a million or increase over million of invested assets at december  due to increases in net written premiums and proceeds from the issuance of trust preferreds 
net investment income earned continued to benefit from higher reinvestment rates as proceeds from maturing bonds were reinvested at currently higher interest rates 
the annualized investment yield net of investment expenses was and at december  and december   respectively 
the tax equivalent investment yield was and at december  and december   respectively 
the increase was the result of the general increase in market interest rates offset by increased allocation to municipal securities 
during the year ended december  realized capital gains were million  a million increase over the net realized capital gains of million during the year ended december  operating expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  over the year ended december  this increase reflects the growth in net exposures applicable to the approximately increase in net earned premiums  and an increase in the accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  both of which were substantially offset by a million decline in prior years reserve development from the level experienced in during  the company experienced approximately million in net prior year reserve development primarily in the accident year  offset somewhat by favorable development on prior years unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the development on accident year reserves was concentrated primarily in the safety equipment class as a result of obtaining new information on several high severity cases 
the increase in the accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily related to the adoption of unpaid industry loss development pattern assumptions in our reserve estimates for other specialty classes during the fourth quarter of  changes in the mix of classes of earned exposures  increased loss and loss adjustment expense cost trends  and increased premium rate competition 

table of contents other operating expenses year ended december  change dollars in thousands amortization of deferred acquisition expenses ceded reinsurance commissions other underwriting and operating expenses other operating expenses during the year ended december   other operating expenses decreased million  or  from the year ended december  amortization of deferred acquisition expenses decreased by million or as a result of the growth in net earned premiums  more than offset by a decline in the rate of acquisition expenses on premiums 
ceded reinsurance commissions increased million or 
this was due to the increase in direct written premiums and ceded premiums  as well as our election to increase premiums ceded under our quota share arrangement by to in january other underwriting and operating expenses  which consist of commissions  other acquisition costs  and general and underwriting expenses  net of acquisition cost deferrals  increased by million 
insurance underwriting commissions increased by million  and other acquisition costs and general and underwriting expenses increased by million 
in addition  the aforementioned increase in ceding commissions caused deferrals of acquisition costs to decline by million 
interest expense year ended december  change dollars in thousands senior notes junior subordinated debentures other n m total interest expense interest expense increased million  or  from to this increase was principally attributable to a million increase in interest expense  million of amortization of debt issuance costs  a million prepayment penalty  and million in write off of debt issuance costs related to the million senior notes issued in august and repaid in october this increase was offset by our redemption of a million promissory note  million of subordinated notes and the cancellation of our bank credit facility that eliminated other interest expense 
interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures included the change in fair value of the interest rate swap on the junior subordinated debentures as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes our effective tax rates were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds fmfc 
fmfc is a holding company with all of its operations being conducted by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  fmfc has continuing cash needs for primarily administrative expenses  debt service and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations come primarily from management and administrative fees from all of our subsidiaries  and dividends from our non insurance subsidiaries 

table of contents insurance subsidiaries 
the primary sources of our insurance subsidiaries cash are net written premiums  claims handling fees  amounts earned from investments and the sale or maturity of invested assets 
additionally  fmfc has in the past and may in the future contribute capital to its insurance subsidiaries 
the primary uses of our insurance subsidiaries cash include the payment of claims and related adjustment expenses  underwriting fees and commissions and taxes and making investments 
because the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our insurance subsidiaries rely on our paid claims history and industry data in determining the expected payout of claims and estimated loss reserves 
to the extent that fmic and anic have an unanticipated shortfall in cash  they may either liquidate securities held in their investment portfolios or obtain capital from fmfc 
however  given the cash generated by our insurance subsidiaries operations and the relatively short duration of their investment portfolios  we do not currently foresee any such shortfall 
no dividends were paid to fmfc by our insurance subsidiaries during the years ended december   or our insurance subsidiaries retained all of their earnings in order to support the increase of their written premiums  and we expect this retention of earnings to continue 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of their domiciliary state insurance departments 
based on the policyholders surplus and the net income of our insurance subsidiaries as of december   fmic and anic may pay dividends in  if declared  of up to million without regulatory approval 
non insurance subsidiaries 
the primary sources of our non insurance subsidiaries cash are commissions and fees  policy fees  administrative fees and claims handling and loss control fees 
the primary uses of our non insurance subsidiaries cash are commissions paid to brokers  operating expenses  taxes and dividends paid to fmfc 
there are generally no restrictions on the payment of dividends by our non insurance subsidiaries  except as may be set forth in our borrowing arrangements 
cash flows our sources of funds have consisted primarily of net written premiums  commissions and fees  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and debt 
we use operating cash primarily to pay operating expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses and for purchasing investments 
a summary of our cash flows is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents for   and  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million  respectively  due primarily to cash received on net written premiums  commissions  fees  and investment income less cash disbursed for operating expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses and income taxes 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during primarily reflects the increase in net written premiums during and cash received for the unearned premiums related to the quota share reinsurance contract terminated on a cut off basis on december  during  operating cash flow was approximately level with due to the growth in ceded reinsurance premiums 
cash received on net written premiums for the year ended december  were retained on a funds withheld basis in accordance with the company s quota share reinsurance contracts  which were reduced to on october   resulting in increased net cash flow provided by operating activities compared to the year ended december  
table of contents for  net cash used in investing activities totaled million  and was primarily invested in short term  debt and equity securities 
the million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of million less cash available from financing activities  a million increase in operating cash flow  and an increase of million in change in cash and cash equivalents 
for  net cash used in investing activities totaled million  and was primarily invested in short term  debt and equity securities 
the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of million less cash available from financing activities  a million increase in operating cash flow  and an increase of million in change in cash and cash equivalents 
for  net cash used in investing activities totaled million resulting primarily from our investment of operating cash flows and cash payments in connection with the notes offering and the repurchase of shares of our minority stockholders  which we refer to as the holdings transaction 
for  the million of net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock in a secondary offering discussed below as well as from proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities discussed below 
for  the million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the proceeds from our initial public offering  offset by the repurchase of common stock and the retirement of the senior notes 
for  the million of net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in august  offset by the repayment of million of bank debt  a million promissory note and million of subordinated capital notes 
based on historical trends  market conditions  and our business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
because economic  market and regulatory conditions may change  however  there can be no assurances that our funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
in addition  competition  pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  and interest rates could significantly affect our short term and long term liquidity needs 
initial public offering we completed our initial public offering of common stock on october  in which we sold  shares of common stock for million 
in connection with the offering  on october   we repurchased all of our outstanding senior notes for million  paid the holder of our convertible preferred stock million pursuant to the terms of our convertible preferred stock  which was also converted into common stock in connection with the initial public offering  and repurchased  shares of common stock 
we used the remaining million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering  along with available cash of million  to make a million contribution to the capital of fmic in october secondary offering on may   the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the purpose of making a follow on offering of common stock 
the company s registration statement was declared effective on june  upon completion of the follow on offering on june   gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock  including  shares of common stock sold to the underwriters of the offering pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  at an offering price per share of  totaled million 
costs associated with the follow on offering included million of underwriting costs and million of other issuance costs 

table of contents long term debt senior notes 
we had million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding  which were issued by holdings in august in connection with the holdings transaction 
the senior notes were set to mature on august   and bore interest at an annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus 
interest was payable quarterly with million of interest paid during the year ended december  on october   we repurchased all of the outstanding senior notes for million  including accrued interest of million and a prepayment penalty of million 
junior subordinated debentures 
we have million cumulative principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures outstanding  million of which were issued in september the debentures were issued in connection with the issuance of trust preferred stock by our wholly owned  non consolidated trusts 
cumulative interest on million of the cumulative principal amount of the debentures is payable quarterly in arrears at a variable annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus for million  the three month libor plus for million  and the three month libor plus for million principal amount of the debentures 
cumulative interest on million of the cumulative principal amount of the debentures is payable quarterly in arrears at a fixed annual rate of through december   and a variable annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor plus thereafter 
for our floating rate junior subordinated debentures  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to pay a fixed rate of interest 
see derivative financial instruments for further discussion 
at december   the three month libor rate was 
we may defer the payment of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods  however  no such deferrals have been made or are expected 
credit facility 
in october  we entered into a credit facility which provided for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at our election as follows i at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate less  each minus  or  ii a rate per annum equal to libor plus an applicable margin which is currently or based on our leverage ratio 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by our material non insurance subsidiaries 
the maturity date of borrowings made under the credit facility is september the credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments and sell assets 
the credit facility also has certain financial covenants 
at december   there were no borrowings under the agreement 
we are not required to comply with the financial related covenants until we borrow under the credit facility 
derivative financial instruments 
financial derivatives are used as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process 
we use interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our junior subordinated debentures 
under two of our swap agreements  which expire in august  we pay interest at a fixed rate of  under our other swap agreement  which expires in december  we pay interest at a fixed rate of 
under all three swap agreements  we receive interest at the three month libor  which is equal to the contractual rate under the junior subordinated debentures 
at december   we had minimal exposure to credit loss on the interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual payments by period long term debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses total the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses payment due by period in the table above are based on the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns by type of business 
as a result  our calculation of the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses payment due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of the reserve of loss and loss adjustment expenses and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty in predicting when claims  including claims that have not yet been incurred but not reported to us  will be paid 
actual payments of losses and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the above table includes all interest payments through the stated maturity of the related long term debt 
variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on interest rates in effect at december   and  as applicable  the variable rate interest included the effects of our interest rate swaps through the expiration of those swap agreements 
cash and invested assets our invested assets consist of fixed maturity securities  convertible securities  and money market funds 
at december   our investments had a market value of million and consisted of the following investments december  market of value portfolio dollars in thousands money market funds treasury securities agency securities corp preferred municipal bonds asset backed securities mortgages convertible securities other total 
table of contents the following table shows the composition of the investment portfolio by remaining time to maturity at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
additionally  the expected maturities of our investments in putable bonds fluctuate inversely with interest rates and therefore may also differ from contractual maturities 
of total average life investment less than one year one to two years two to three years three to four years four to five years five to seven years more than seven years total the primary goals of our investment portfolio are to accumulate and preserve capital  assure proper levels of liquidity  optimize total after tax return subject to acceptable risk levels  provide an acceptable and stable level of current income  and approximate duration match between investments and our liabilities 
in keeping with these goals  we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of high grade fixed income securities 
our investment policy is developed by the investment committee of the board of directors and is designed to comply with the regulatory investment requirements and restrictions to which our insurance subsidiaries are subject 
we have structured our investment policy to manage the various risks inherent in achieving our objectives 
credit related risk is addressed by limiting minimum weighted average portfolio credit quality to aa 
per issue credit limits have been set to limit exposure to single issue credit events 
with the exception of convertible securities  which according to our investment policy may comprise up to of our portfolio  all investments must be rated investment grade at the time of purchase with no more than of the aggregate portfolio held in bbb rated securities 
in addition  the convertible sector of the portfolio must maintain a weighted average credit quality of investment grade 
interest rate risk or duration risk management was tied to the duration of the liability reserves 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  is approximately years and the tax effected duration is years 
excluding cash and convertible securities  the portfolio duration and tax effected duration are years and years  respectively 
the shorter tax effected duration reflects the significant portion of the portfolio in municipal securities 
the annualized investment yield net of investment expenses on total investments was and for december  and december   respectively 
the tax equivalent investment yield was and at december  and december   respectively 
the increase was the result of higher reinvestment yields on new purchases versus maturing bonds offset somewhat by increased allocation to municipal securities 
our investment policy establishes diversification requirements across various fixed income sectors including governments  agencies  mortgage and asset backed securities  corporate bonds  preferred stocks  municipal bonds and convertible securities 
although our investment policy allows for investments in equity securities  we virtually have no current exposure nor have any current plans to add exposure to equities 
convertible securities are utilized as a means of achieving equity exposure with lower long term volatility than the broad equity market while having the added benefit of being treated as bonds from a statutory perspective 

table of contents we utilize four investment managers  each with its own specialty 
each of these managers has authority and discretion to buy and sell securities subject to guidelines established by our investment committee 
management monitors the investment managers as well as our investment results with the assistance of an investment advisor that has been advising us since early our investment advisor is independent of our investment managers and the funds in which we invest 
each manager is measured against a customized benchmark on a monthly basis 
investment performance and market conditions are continually monitored 
the investment committee reviews our investment results quarterly 
the majority of our portfolio consists of aaa or aa rated securities with a standard and poor s weighted average credit quality for our aggregate fixed income portfolio of aa at december  the majority of the investments rated bbb and below are convertible securities 
consistent with our investment policy  we review any security if it falls below bbb and assess whether it should be held or sold 
the following table shows the ratings distribution of our fixed income portfolio as of december  as a percentage of total market value 
of total s p rating investments aaa aa a bbb bb b ccc nr total within mortgages  the company invests in residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmo that typically have high credit quality  offer good liquidity and are expected to provide an advantage in yield compared to us treasury securities 
the company s investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches which offer the most favorable return given the risks involved 
one significant risk evaluated is prepayment sensitivity 
while prepayment risk either shortening or lengthening of duration and its effect on total return cannot be fully controlled  particularly when interest rates move dramatically  the investment process generally favors securities that control this risk within expected interest rate ranges 
the company does not purchase residual interests in cmo s 
at december   the company held cmo s classified as available for sale with a fair value of million 
approximately of those cmo holdings were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by government sponsored enterprises gse such as gnma  fnma or fhlmc 
in addition  at december   the company held million of mortgage backed pass through securities issued by one of the gse s and classified as available for sale 
the company held commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs of million  of which are pre vintage  at december  the average subordination of our cmbs portfolio was and comprised mainly of super senior structures 
the average loan to value ratio at origination was 
the average credit rating of these securities was aaa 
the cmbs portfolio was supported by loans that were diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas 
it is not believed that this portfolio exposes the company to a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of these securities 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio included asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations collateralized by sub prime mortgages and alternative documentation mortgages alt a with market values of million and million at december   respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments with weighted average fico scores below alt a securities are defined by above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios  high debt to income ratios  low loan documentation eg  limited or no verification of income and assets  or other characteristics that are inconsistent with 
table of contents conventional underwriting standards employed by government sponsored mortgage entities 
the average credit rating on all of these securities and obligations held by the company at december  was aaa 
the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  included securities issued by numerous municipalities with a total carrying value of million 
approximately million  or  were pre refunded escrowed with treasuries 
approximately million  or  of the securities were enhanced by third party insurance for the payment of principal and interest in the event of an issuer default 
such insurance generally results in a rating of aaa being assigned by independent ratings agencies to those securities 
the downgrade of credit ratings of insurers of these securities could result in a corresponding downgrade in the ratings of the securities from aaa to the underlying rating of the respective security without giving effect to the benefit of insurance 
of the total million of insured municipal securities in the company s investment portfolio at december   approximately were rated at a or above  and approximately were rated at aa or above  without the benefit of insurance 
the average underlying credit rating of the entire municipal bond portfolio was aa at december  the company believes that a loss of the benefit of insurance would not result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the underlying credit strength of the issuers of the securities  as well as the company s ability and intent to hold the securities 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on hand of million at december  at december  the total unrealized loss of all impaired securities totaled million 
this represents approximately of year end invested assets of million 
this unrealized loss position is the function of the purchase of specific securities in a lower interest rate environment than what prevails as of december  some of these losses are due to the increase in spreads of select corporate bonds 
we have viewed these market value declines as being temporary in nature 
our portfolio is relatively short as the duration of the fixed income portfolio excluding cash and convertible securities is approximately years 
we expect to hold the majority of these temporarily impaired securities until maturity in the event that interest rates do not decline from current levels 
in light of our significant growth over the past months  liquidity needs from the portfolio are inconsequential 
as a result  we would not expect to have to liquidate temporarily impaired securities to pay claims or for any other purposes 
there have been certain instances over the past year  where due to market based opportunities  we have elected to sell a small portion of the portfolio 
these situations were unique and infrequent occurrences and in our opinion  do not reflect an indication that we do not have the intent and ability to hold these securities until they mature or recover in value 
below is a table that illustrates the unrecognized impairment loss by sector 
the rise in interest rates was the primary factor leading to impairment 
all asset sectors were affected by the overall increase in rates as can be seen from the table below 
in addition to the general level of rates  we also look at a variety of other factors such as direction of credit spreads for an individual issue as well as the magnitude of specific securities that have declined below amortized cost 
amount of impairment sector at december  dollars in thousands debt securities us government securities government agency mortgage backed securities government agency obligations collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate bonds total debt securities preferred stocks total 
table of contents the most significant risk or uncertainty inherent in our assessment methodology is that the current credit rating of a particular issue changes over time 
if the rating agencies should change their rating on a particular security in our portfolio  it could lead to a reclassification of that specific issue 
the vast majority of our unrecognized impairment losses are investment grade and aaa or aa rated 
should the credit quality of individual issues decline for whatever reason then it would lead us to reconsider the classification of that particular security 
within the non investment grade sector  we continue to monitor the particular status of each issue 
should prospects for any one issue deteriorate  we would potentially alter our classification of that particular issue 
the table below illustrates the breakdown of impaired securities by investment grade and non investment grade as well as the duration that these sectors have been trading below amortized cost 
the average duration of the impairment has been greater than months 
the unrealized loss of impaired securities as a percent of the amortized cost of those securities is as of december  of total total average unrealized loss of loss amortized cost amortized cost total loss as of amortized cost months dollars in thousands non investment grade investment grade total all securities trading at a loss are investment grade 
the majority of these securities are aaa or aa rated 
these issues are continually monitored and may be classified in the future as being other than temporarily impaired 
the largest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is corporate bonds at approximately of the total loss 
these securities are highly rated and have been affected primarily by the current interest rate environment 
the next highest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is obligations of states and political subdivisions at of the total loss 
these issues have been affected as well by the overall level of interest rates 
the next highest concentration of temporarily impaired securities is collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities at followed by preferred stocks at of the total loss  government agency mortgage backed securities at of the total loss  and lastly government agency obligations at 
these unrealized losses are due to the rise in rates as well 
for the year ended december   we sold approximately million of market value of fixed income securities excluding convertibles  which were trading below amortized cost while recording a realized loss of million 
this loss represented of the amortized cost of the positions 
these sales were unique opportunities to sell specific positions due to changing market conditions 
these situations were exceptions to our general assertion regarding our ability and intent to hold securities with unrealized losses until they mature or recover in value 
this position is further supported by the insignificant losses as a percentage of amortized cost for the respective periods 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer a portion of the costs of acquiring insurance business  primarily commissions and certain policy underwriting and issuance costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of insurance business 
for the year ended december   million of the costs were deferred 
deferred policy acquisition costs totaled million  or of unearned premiums net of reinsurance  at december  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate losses under all insurance policies that we write and our loss adjustment expenses relating to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our estimated ultimate costs of all reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at the balance sheet date 
our reserves reflect our estimates at a given time of amounts that we expect to pay for losses that have been reported  which are referred to as case reserves  and losses that have been incurred but not reported and the expected development of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses on open reported cases  which are referred to as ibnr 
table of contents reserves 
in evaluating whether the reserves are reasonable for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  it is necessary to project future losses and loss adjustment expense payments 
our reserves are carried at the total estimate for ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we do not discount the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our reserves consist of reserves for property and liability losses  consistent with the coverages provided for in the insurance policies directly written or assumed by us under reinsurance contracts 
in many cases  several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss 
the estimation of ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact measurement of liability  but are estimates 
although we believe that our reserve estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss experience may not conform to our assumptions and may  in fact  vary significantly from our assumptions 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of losses and the related loss adjustment expenses may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
we continually review our estimates and adjust them as we believe appropriate as our experience develops or new information becomes known to us 
such adjustments are included in current results of operations 
for a further discussion of how we determine our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and the uncertainty surrounding those estimates  see critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
reconciliation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish a reserve for both reported and unreported covered losses  which includes estimates of both future payments of losses and related loss adjustment expenses 
the following table represents changes in our aggregate reserves during  and dollars in thousands balance  january less reinsurance recoverables net balance  january incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  december plus reinsurance recoverables balance  december during  the company experienced million of favorable development in net prior accident year reserves 
favorable development in our security general liability classes was million  consisting of million in favorable development in accident years  and unfavorable development of million in accident years the favorable development in accident years was primarily in accident year as a result of lower than expected frequency  severity  and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the unfavorable development in was due to increases in case reserves on a small number of high severity claims based on obtaining new information 

table of contents unfavorable development in our specialty general liability classes was million  consisting of million in favorable development in the accident year  and unfavorable development of million principally in accident years the favorable development in accident year was due to lower than expected frequency  severity  and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the unfavorable development in included three late reported claims received in the fourth quarter of for catastrophe hurricane rita and thunderstorm related losses 
these claims are being contested by lawsuit and involve severe property damage to commercial buildings in port arthur  texas 
the unfavorable development was also due to increases in case reserves on a small number of high severity claims based on obtaining new information 
in addition  these factors caused related increases in estimates of incurred but not reported losses 
favorable development in unallocated loss adjustment expenses was million across multiple accident years 
during  the company experienced approximately million in net prior year reserve development principally in the accident year  offset somewhat by favorable development on prior years unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the development on accident year reserves was concentrated primarily in the safety equipment class as a result of obtaining new information on several high severity cases 
during  we experienced adverse development in the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years through  with respect to policies written for security classes  especially in the safety equipment installation and service class 
the prior year reserve development occurred due to new information which emerged during on a small number of complex high severity cases  causing increased net case reserve valuations or loss and loss adjustment expense payments of million that were not anticipated in our prior years ibnr reserve estimates 
this development was inconsistent with our historical loss and loss and loss adjustment expense reporting patterns 
our historic reporting patterns for this class generally reflect minimal development beyond the fourth year of maturity 
the loss development on policies written during to has been volatile  and more slowly developing  compared to expectations based on our historic loss emergence patterns that are associated with the same classes of policies 
the overall loss experience on these policies has been significantly worse than our insurance subsidiaries historic experience on policies written both before and after this period 
in response to the adverse loss development in  we increased our reserves applicable to prior accident years for security classes by approximately million during our loss experience on policies that we wrote for the safety equipment installation and service class during to has been significantly worse than on policies written for other security classes  with an average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of approximately during those accident years 
we have written the safety equipment class throughout our history on a profitable basis  and we expanded our writings in this class dramatically from through  primarily through writing new policies for former customers of several competitors who exited the property casualty markets during that period 
our underwriters relied on loss history data provided by the former competitors and increased premium rates accordingly on these policies  and we expected the new policies to be profitable 
while we increased the prices on new policies from those charged by the previous insurers  the historical loss information we used to underwrite some of the new policies was based on information provided by previous insurers who left the market  and much of that information was later found to be inaccurate or incomplete 
in retrospect  premium rates for new policies written for the safety equipment installation and service class during this period ultimately proved to be inadequate 
the impact of the inadequate premium rates was compounded by our growth in the safety equipment installation and service class during that period 
in reaction to the observed deterioration in the loss experience of the safety equipment installation and service class  we implemented a number of changes in both the safety equipment installation and service class and other security classes  many of these changes coincided with and were facilitated by the hard market conditions that emerged during this period  and include the following extensive re underwriting of policies during and  adoption of more stringent underwriting standards  de emphasis of unprofitable markets  
table of contents increased premium rates from to  implementation of many coverage exclusions  restrictions  endorsements  and higher deductibles in and  implementation of improved audit premium and deductible procedures and controls  and beginning in june  our purchase of excess reinsurance so that we reduced our net per occurrence losses and loss adjustment expense retention by 
as a result of these actions  net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses and the net incurred loss ratios and frequency of losses for the to accident years on policies written for security classes have improved significantly in comparison to the to accident years  which resulted in overall improved calendar year loss ratios from through in addition  during we increased our reserves applicable to policies written for other specialty classes by approximately million  principally as a result of using updated industry loss development factors  which became available to us during  in the calculations of ultimate expected losses and reserves on those classes 
these updated factors indicate that losses are expected to emerge more slowly than what was reflected in the previous industry development factors that we used 
we began writing for other specialty classes in and have seven years or less of our own historical loss experience for these classes 
consequently  we have relied significantly on industry development factors in our reserve estimates 
as our historical experience increases  we give more weight to our own experience and reduce the amount of weight given to industry experience in our reserve estimates 
from through  we had used an earlier set of available industry development factors from a study published in for other specialty classes 
we adopted the industry development factors that became available during because they reflected more recent industry experience  were separated into losses and loss adjustment expenses and in more class and coverage limit segments that aligned more closely with our classifications and coverage limits  and were more closely aligned with our actual emerging experience 
the increases and decreases in incurred losses related to prior accident years primarily resulted from differences in actual versus expected loss development 
loss development 
below is a table showing the development of our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for us for report years through the table portrays the changes in the loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves in subsequent years relative to the prior loss estimates based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  on a gaap basis 
the first line of the table shows  for the years indicated  the net reserve liability including the reserve for incurred but not reported losses as originally estimated 
for example  as of december  it was estimated that million would be a sufficient reserve to settle all claims not already settled that had occurred prior to december   whether reported or unreported to our insurance subsidiaries 
the next section of the table sets forth the re estimates in later years of incurred losses  including payments  for the years indicated 
for example  as reflected in that section of the table  the original reserve of million was re estimated to be million at december  the increase decrease from the original estimate would generally be a combination of factors  including reserves being settled for amounts different from the amounts originally estimated  reserves being increased or decreased for individual claims that remain open as more information becomes known about those individual claims  and more or fewer claims being reported after december  than had been reported before that date 
the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents  as of december   the difference between the latest re estimated liability and the reserves as originally estimated 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate for reserves  a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate for reserves 
for example  because the reserves established as of december  at 
table of contents million were reestablished at december  at million  it was re estimated that the reserves which were established as of december  included a million redundancy 
the next section of the table shows  by year  the cumulative amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid as of the end of each succeeding year 
for example  with respect to the net losses and loss expense reserve of million as of december  by december  ten years later million actually had been paid in settlement of the claims which pertain to the reserve as of december  information with respect to the cumulative development of gross reserves that is  without deduction for reinsurance ceded also appears at the bottom portion of the table 
anic s reserves averaged approximately of our total reserves for each year in the ten year period ended december  from through  anic s reserves were primarily applicable to anic s non standard personal auto and commercial multi peril business lines  which were discontinued in beginning in  anic s reserves were derived primarily from its assumed quota share of a portion of the premiums produced by coverx

table of contents factors contributing to the reserve development in the preceding table are as follows during and  our insurance subsidiaries experienced significant favorable development of their reserves  reflecting redundancies in both years 
this development was significantly influenced by the police and public officials classes of business which fmic s predecessor organization  first mercury syndicate fms began writing in  and fmic stopped writing in early reported losses and loss adjustment expense emergence in those classes was worse than industry experience  and estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses and related reserves were based on a continuation of the adverse trend and use of industry development factors 
in addition  fms s loss and loss adjustment experience data only went back to fms s formation in  so greater weight was given to industry data compared to our claims experience in establishing ibnr 
as our policies in the accident years matured  the loss trends moderated and ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses emerged lower than the industry data indications 
from through  the reserves gave greater weight to loss development patterns from our historical experience through  and were adjusted for differences between actual and expected development as losses and loss adjustment expenses emerged 
during  a significant amount of adverse development occurred related to accident years through  and our insurance subsidiaries increased their reserves accordingly 
in addition  we increased our reserves applicable to other specialty classes  principally as a result of using updated industry loss development factors  which became available during  in the calculations of ultimate expected losses and reserves on other specialty classes 
during  the company experienced approximately million in net prior year reserve development primarily in the accident year  offset somewhat by favorable development on prior years unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the development on accident year reserves was concentrated primarily in the safety equipment class as a result of obtaining new information on several high severity cases 
during  the company experienced approximately million of favorable development in net prior year reserves primarily in the accident year due to lower than expected loss and allocated loss adjustment expense emergence  offset by unfavorable development on to accident years reserves 
because the loss table above is prepared on a reported year basis  the million and million in unfavorable net reserve and gross reserve development  respectively  on the december  net and gross reported reserves appears in the applicable reported year that coincides with the related accident years affected and is repeated in each subsequent year through for policies written from the middle of through the present  historical experience for security classes has improved due to the underwriting initiatives taken in response to the deterioration in loss experience for the through accident years  especially in the safety equipment installation and service class 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries cede insurance risk to reinsurers to diversify their risks and limit their maximum loss arising from large or unusually hazardous risks or catastrophic events 
additionally  our insurance subsidiaries use reinsurance in order to limit the amount of capital needed to support their operations and to facilitate growth 
reinsurance involves a primary insurance company transferring  or ceding  a portion of its premium and losses in order to control its exposure 
the ceding of liability to a reinsurer does not relieve the obligation of the primary insurer to the policyholder 
the primary insurer remains liable for the entire loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement 
in june  following the investment in our convertible preferred stock  fmfc contributed additional capital to fmic  resulting in an increase in fmic s statutory surplus of million 
shortly thereafter  am best raised fmic s financial strength rating to a and size rating to vii  thus qualifying it to be the direct writer of substantially all of the premiums produced by coverx 
on may   the prior assumed reinsurance contracts terminated 
by december   substantially all premiums produced were written directly by fmic 
fmic entered into ceding reinsurance contracts effective june  ceding per occurrence coverages in excess of  per risk  and ceding of its net retention to an unaffiliated reinsurer and to anic 
table of contents  increasing the combined net retention of our insurance subsidiaries to of the first  per occurrence 
we increased the premiums ceded under quota share agreements with unaffiliated reinsurers to in july and in january during  we maintained a quota share on all of our business other than our legal professional liability class  for which we maintained a variable to quota share  and our umbrella policies  for which we maintained a quota share 
on december  we elected the cut off termination option available to us on the expiration of our quota share contracts expiring that day in accordance with the termination provisions of these quota share contracts 
as a result  we effectively eliminated the quota share reinsurance on the million unearned premiums as of december  that had been ceded prior to contract expiration 
this amount of previously ceded net unearned premium reserve was returned to the company as a result of the cut off termination election and reported in the company s net earned premiums for the year ended december  during the first four months of  we maintained a quota share on the majority of our business other than our legal professional liability class  for which we maintained a variable to quota share  and our umbrella policies  for which we maintain a quota share 
on may   we amended our quota share reinsurance treaties to include the legal professional liability class 
on october   we exercised the reset provision in our quota share reinsurance treaties to increase our retention to 
effective january   we purchased quota share reinsurance to replace the expiring quota share reinsurance  which  as stated above  was reduced to on october   for policies issued with effective dates beginning january  in  we also maintained two quota share reinsurance treaties for our hospitality and employer general liability classes 
our excess of loss reinsurance is used to limit our maximum exposure per claim occurrence 
we maintained a million excess of million per occurrence primary security and specialty general liability and million excess of million per occurrence legal professional liability coverage through december   and we have purchased million excess of million per occurrence primary security and specialty general liability and million excess of million per occurrence coverage legal professional liability for in addition  we maintained million excess of million per occurrence coverage for a portion of the risks in our hospitality class 
on april   we extended the quota share reinsurance applicable to umbrella policies through march  we have historically adjusted our level of quota share reinsurance based on our premiums produced and our level of capitalization  as well as our risk appetite for a particular type of business 
we believe that the current reinsurance market for the lines of business that we insure is stable in both capacity and pricing 
in addition  we do not anticipate structural changes to our reinsurance strategies  but rather will continue to adjust our level of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance based on our premiums produced  level of capitalization and risk appetite 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to be able to execute our reinsurance strategies on a basis consistent with our historical and current reinsurance structures 
the following table illustrates our direct written premiums and ceded for the years ended december   and direct written premiums and premiums ceded year ended december  dollars in thousands direct written premiums ceded written premiums net written premiums ceded written premiums as percentage of direct written premiums 
table of contents the following table illustrates the effect of our reinsurance ceded strategies on our results of operations year ended december  dollars in thousands ceded written premiums ceded premiums earned losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded ceding commissions our net cash flows relating to ceded reinsurance activities premiums paid less losses recovered and ceding commissions received were approximately million net cash paid for the year ended december  compared to net cash paid of million for the year ended december  we paid approximately million for the year ended december  the assuming reinsurer is obligated to indemnify the ceding company to the extent of the coverage ceded 
the inability to recover amounts due from reinsurers could result in significant losses to us 
to protect us from reinsurance recoverable losses  fmic seeks to enter into reinsurance agreements with financially strong reinsurers 
our senior executives evaluate the credit risk of each reinsurer before entering into a contract and monitor the financial strength of the reinsurer 
on december   substantially all reinsurance contracts to which we were a party were with companies with am best ratings of a or better 
one reinsurance contract to which we were a party was with a reinsurer that does not carry an am best rating 
for this contract  we required full collateralization of our recoverable via a grantor trust and an irrevocable letter of credit 
in addition  ceded reinsurance contracts contain trigger clauses through which fmic can initiate cancellation including immediate return of all ceded unearned premiums at its option  or which result in immediate collateralization of ceded reserves by the assuming company in the event of a financial strength rating downgrade  thus limiting credit exposure 
on december   there was no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance  as all reinsurance balances were current and there were no disputes with reinsurers 
on december  and december   fmfc had a net amount of recoverables from reinsurers of million and million  respectively  on a consolidated basis 
the following is a summary of our insurance subsidiaries net reinsurance recoverables by reinsurer net amount net amount recoverable as of recoverable as of am december  december  best rating dollars in thousands ace property casualty insurance company a   swiss reinsurance america corporation a   american constantine insurance company nr  platinum underwriters reinsurance  inc a   other total substantially all other reinsurers carry an am best rating of a and above 
american constantine insurance company acic does not carry an am best rating 
the net amount of recoverables from acic at december  is fully collateralized by a grantor trust and irrevocable letter of credit 
the reinsurance market moves in pricing cycles which are correlated with the primary insurance market 
thus  after experiencing adverse reserve development due to inadequate pricing during the soft market  the amount of capacity in the reinsurance market has decreased 
this has in turn placed upward pressure on reinsurance prices and restricted terms

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk and interest rate risk 

table of contents credit risk credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer or a reinsurer 
we address the risk associated with debt issuers by investing in fixed maturity securities that are investment grade  which are those securities rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
our outside investment managers assist us in this process 
we utilize a variety of tools and analysis as part of this process 
if a security is rated bbb or higher by standard poor s at the time that we purchase it and is then downgraded below bbb while we hold it  we evaluate the security for impairment  and after discussing the security with our investment advisors  we make a decision to either dispose of the security or continue to hold it 
finally  we employ stringent diversification rules that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we address the risk associated with reinsurers by generally targeting reinsurers with am best financial strength ratings of a or better 
in an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of our reinsurers  we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of each reinsurer annually 
in addition  we continually monitor rating downgrades involving any of our reinsurers 
at december   all but one insignificant reinsurance contract was with companies with am best ratings of a or better 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through an asset and liability matching process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
our outside investment managers assist us in this process 
we have million cumulative principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures outstanding 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements through with a combined notional amount of million and through with a notional amount of million in order to fix the interest rate on this debt  thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our debentures 
the table below illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of our fixed maturity securities to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and stockholders equity hypothetical increase estimated estimated decrease in fair change in fair stockholders value fair value value equity dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease at december   our convertible securities had a total fair value of million
