domestic sales were million during compared to million in the comparable period of  a decline 
within the domestic segment  lower sales of both heat exchange and temperature control products was driven by branch closures which occurred during the fourth quarter of and throughout  customer efforts to lower inventory levels and soft market demand 
the customer inventory actions and soft market demand was attributable to economic and weather conditions which lead to a soft and short selling season 
the shift in customer mix due to lower sales through the company s branch locations  resulted in lower average selling prices for domestic products

borrowings classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheet included in this report 
based upon year end borrowing levels and interest rates  annual interest cost would approximate million 
pension plan contributions reflect expected disbursements in as calculated by the company s third party actuaries 
estimated contributions for future years are not currently determinable as they will be impacted by changes in discount rates  pension plan performance and other factors 
purchase obligations for goods and services outstanding at the end of the year which normally are consumed over a period of less than months 
this is not reflective of total consumption over a month period 
see note  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
payments may be accelerated due to use of insurance proceeds or other mandatory pre payments 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a company s critical accounting estimates  as set forth by the us securities and exchange commission  are those which are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and often require the utilization of estimates or subjective judgment 
based upon this definition  we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
th e company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  which are further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized either when products are shipped to the customer or when products are received by the customer in accordance with the invoice shipping terms 
sales are recorded net of sales rebates  cash discounts  returns and advertising and other allowances 
accruals for warranty costs  sales returns and allowances are provided at the time of sale based upon historical experience or agreements currently in place with customers 
the company will also accrue for unusual warranty exposures at the time the exposure is identified and quantifiable based upon analyses of expected product failure rates and engineering cost estimates 
in connection with 
table of contents multi year agreements with certain customers  the company incurs customer acquisition costs which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
the company also establishes reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based upon historical experience  anticipated business trends and current economic conditions 
customer account balances are written off at the time they are deemed fully uncollectible 
changes in our customers financial condition or other factors could cause our estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable or the amortization periods of customer acquisition costs to vary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
this requires the company to make judgments about the likely method of disposition of its inventory and expected recoverable value upon disposition 
inventories are reviewed on a continuing basis  and provisions are also made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of historical or expected usage as well as the expected recoverable value upon disposition 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a business unit s long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the business unit  associated with the long lived assets  would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write down is required 
if this review indicates that the assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value of the company s assets would be reduced to their estimated fair value 
the estimates used in determining whether an impairment exists involve future cash flows of each business unit  which are based upon expected revenue trends  cost of production and operating expenses 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those such assets will not be realized 
changes to the valuation allowance are based on the evaluation of all available evidence supporting the company s ability to utilize tax benefits prior to their expiration 
pension plans 
the company establishes and periodically reviews the assumptions used in the measurement of its domestic and foreign retirement plans 
the discount rate used in the assumption will change in relation to increases or decreases in applicable published bond indices 
at december   the discount rate for domestic plans was  which was developed by matching yields on selected highly rated aaa or aa corporate bonds with benefit payment streams of the company s plans 
the return on assets for domestic plans reflects the long term rate of return on plan assets expected to be realized over a ten year or longer period 
as such  it will normally not be adjusted for short term trends in the stock or bond markets 
in addition  the rate of return will reflect the investment allocation currently used to manage the pension portfolio 
th e company s domestic pension plan assumptions currently include a long term annual rate of return  which is based upon the current portfolio allocation  long term rates of return for similar investment vehicles and economic and other indicators of future performance 
each increase or decrease in the expected rate of return assumption would decrease or increase the net periodic plan cost by million 
differences between actual and assumed portfolio performance as well as the impact of changes in discount rates are included in the calculation of the company s accrued pension costs by a third party actuary 
in the future  the domestic plan unrecognized net loss  of million at december   along with changes in any of the underlying pension assumptions  and the ongoing performance of the plan assets  will impact future funding requirements  minimum pension liability adjustments and net pension cost amounts 
absent any other changes  a change in the discount rate increases or decreases pension expense by million per year and the pension benefit obligation by million 
other material assumptions which are reviewed annually include the compensation increase rates  rates of employee termination and rates of participant mortality 
in  the company changed the mortality table which it utilizes from the group annuity mortality table to the rp mortality table  in order to better match current mortality levels 
the impact of this change was a million increase in the pension benefit obligation at december  and a million increase in the minimum pension adjustment reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet as of december  pension assumptions for the company s foreign plans are established taking into consideration financial and economic conditions impacting the countries in which the plans are located 
loss reserves 
the company has other loss exposures such as self insurance  environmental and litigation for which it determines the need and amount of reserves 
reserves are established using estimates  judgments and consistent methodologies to determine the exposure and ultimate potential liability 
inflation the overall impact of united states inflation in recent years has not resulted in a significant change in labor costs or the cost of general services utilized by the company 
however  during each of the last five years  commodity prices have increased significantly over the prior year 
the principal raw materials used in the company s replacement radiator and heater core product lines are copper and brass 
the company also uses aluminum for its radiator  charge air cooler  condenser and heater core product lines 
copper  brass  aluminum and other primary metals used in the company s business are generally subject to commodity pricing and variations in the market prices for such materials 
the company typically executes purchase orders for its copper and brass requirements three to nine months prior to the actual delivery date 
in periods of abnormally high commodity market prices  the company will place orders only for its current requirements 
in ei ther case  the purchase price for such copper  brass and aluminum is established at the time such orders are placed by the company and not at the time of delivery 
to offset these cost increases  the company has been successful in passing through some price increases on its heavy duty products  however  on its automotive and light truck heat exchange products  it has been unable to do so 
as a result  the company has been forced to generate other cost reduction activities in order to offset these cost increases 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in raising prices to its customers in the future or that it will be able to generate sufficient cost reductions to offset rising commodity prices 
the company currently does not use financial derivatives or other methods to hedge costs with respect to its metals consumption 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  foreign  state and local laws designed to protect the environment and believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent risk of environmental damage and financial liability to the company 
on january   the company signed a consent agreement with the state of connecticut department of environmental protection 
under the agreement the company voluntarily initiated the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination on property occupied by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company over years ago 
the company believes there will not be a material adverse impact to its financial results due to the investigation and cleanup activities 
it is reasonably possible that environmental related liabilities may also exist with respect to other industrial sites formerly owned or occupied by the company 
based upon information currently available  the company believes that the cost of any potential remediation for which the company may ultimately be responsible will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
the company currently does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of the company s business  and there is no assurance that material environmental liabilities and compliance charges will not arise 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and results in financial statements reflecting the expected 
table of contents future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions 
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december  the pension protection act of ppa was signed by the president and enacted in august the ppa will change the method for determining minimum pension contributions and certain plan reporting commencing in calendar year the company does not expect that the ppa will have a material impact on pension contributions in in september  the fasb issued sfas no
