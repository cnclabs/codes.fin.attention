item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview the company is a leading global reinsurer with a broadly diversified portfolio of risks 
the company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide  and differentiates itself through its approach to risk  its strategy to manage risk  and its financial strength 
through its broad product and geographic diversification  its excellent execution capabilities and its local presence in most major markets  the company is able to respond quickly to market needs  and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world 
reinsurance is by its nature a risk assumption business 
the company s business is to assume its clients risks  thereby removing the volatility associated with these risks from the clients financial statements  and then manage those risks and the risk related volatility 
the company s ability to succeed in the risk assumption business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk  to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate  and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and absolute limits for the risks assumed 
the reinsurance markets have historically been highly cyclical in nature 
the cycle is driven by competition  the amount of capital and capacity in the industry  loss events and investment returns 
the company s long term strategy to generate shareholder value focuses on broad product and geographic diversification of risks  assuming a moderately greater degree of risk than the market average  actively managing its capital across its portfolio and over the duration of the cycle  adding value through underwriting and transactional excellence and achieving superior returns on invested assets in the context of a disciplined risk framework 
the company generates its revenue primarily from premiums 
premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions 
pricing cycles are driven by supply of capital in the industry and demand for reinsurance and other risk transfer products 
the reinsurance business is also influenced by several other factors  including variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments  loss trends  inflation and general economic conditions 
throughout the late s  the industry s operating profitability and cash flows declined as a result of declining prices  a deterioration in terms and conditions and increasing loss costs 
these negative trends were  however  offset by high investment returns that led to continued growth in capital 
premium rates began to increase in  when the large loss events of that year  including the september tragedy and the enron bankruptcy  in addition to steep declines in interest rates and equity values  added to the pressure for improvements in pricing and underwriting conditions 
these improvements continued through the middle of in the second half of through  the company began to see a flattening in the rate of improvement in the terms and conditions of the most profitable lines  and a slower rate of improvement in those lines that had not yet reached their peak in terms of profitability 
during  pricing was generally flat to down  except for those lines specifically affected by the hurricanes 
however  eventually developed into the worst year in the history of the industry in terms of catastrophe losses  with hurricane katrina being the largest insured event ever  two other significant atlantic hurricanes  rita and wilma  as well as a significant windstorm and a flood in europe 
consequently  the company observed in strong pricing increases in the lines and geographies that were affected by the large catastrophic loss events  including catastrophe covers in the southeastern us and in the us property and energy lines 
pricing in other lines was generally stable 
in  pricing remained strong for us wind exposed lines  while all other lines saw pricing declines 
the january  renewals saw a continuation of trends characteristic of a market in transition 
the market was more competitive than at january   yet still rational 
there were pricing declines in most major markets and most lines of business 
there was a continuation of the trend toward increasing risk retention by cedants  and restructuring proportional coverages to non proportional treaties  which led to the continued reduction in the amount of premiums in the reinsurance marketplace 
nevertheless  the company wrote a 
table of contents considerable amount of new business during the january  renewals and believes it has maintained priced profitability on business renewed above its long term priced return on deployed capital target of over a cycle 
despite challenging market conditions  the company has not changed its strategy or approach and continues to be opportunistic in writing business in its core reinsurance activities  as well as exploring opportunities in the capital markets 
the company intends to continue to maintain balance and diversification in its overall portfolio 
a key challenge facing the company is to successfully manage through the less profitable portion of the reinsurance cycle 
the company is confident in its long term strategy  and believes that by closely monitoring the progression of each line of business  being selective in the business that it writes  and maintaining the diversification and balance of its portfolio  it will continue to optimize returns 
individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time 
management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product  geography  line and type of business  length of tail  and distribution channel  and that this diversification  in addition to the financial strength of the company and its strong global franchise  will help to mitigate cyclical declines in underwriting profitability and to achieve a more balanced return over time 
within the company s life segment  the reinsurance market is differentiated between mortality and longevity products  with mortality being the larger market and longevity being smaller  but growing 
for the mortality markets in which the company writes business  the company observed stable pricing for continental europe and latin america 
in contrast  there are much more competitive conditions in the uk and ireland  and while these two markets remain attractive  appropriate risk selection and pricing is important 
the company does not write life business in the us market 
the company s profitability is significantly affected by the level of its losses and loss expenses incurred 
the company recognizes losses and loss expenses on the basis of actual and expected claims on business written and earned 
the company s non life net reserve position at december  was billion 
management believes that it follows prudent reserving policies to maintain a strong financial position 
a key challenge for the company is the accurate estimation of loss reserves for each line of business  which is critical in order to accurately determine the profitability of each line and allocate the optimal amount of capital to each line 
another key challenge for the company is to appropriately allocate capital in a manner that optimizes profitability 
the company also generates revenue from its substantial and high quality investment portfolio 
the company follows prudent investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the company s overall objectives of earnings stability and long term book value growth 
liability funds are used to support the company s net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s operating and reinsurance liabilities  net of reinsurance assets  and are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in terms of both duration and currency composition to protect the company against changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
the company invests the liability funds in high quality fixed income securities with the primary objective of preserving liquidity and protecting capital 
capital funds are invested to achieve total returns that enhance growth in shareholders equity and are invested in investment grade and below investment grade fixed income securities and equity instruments 
a key challenge for the company is achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns that include price appreciation or depreciation in changing market conditions 
the company regularly reviews the allocation of investments to asset classes within its investment portfolio and reallocates investments to those asset classes the company anticipates will outperform in the near future  subject to limits and guidelines 
the company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed income portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates  or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes  depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s capital markets unit  which includes both public and private market investments  experienced a difficult second half of with the collapse of the credit markets  and the market turmoil 
table of contents continues into the collapse of the us sub prime mortgage market affected a large number of collateralized debt obligations cdos that contained sub prime securities and developed into a liquidity and credit crisis 
the potential impact of the turmoil in the credit markets has been substantially mitigated by the company s high quality asset portfolio described above and the company did not have direct exposure to sub prime mortgages in its investment portfolio at december  even in this environment  the company s total return on the capital markets risks was positive during  though below the risk free rate of return 
the company believes that even though there will be years where capital markets risks return less than the risk free rate of return  or potentially even results in a negative return  the rewards for assuming these risks in a disciplined and measured way will produce a positive excess return to the company over time 
additionally  since capital markets risks are not fully correlated with the company s reinsurance risks  this element of our strategy increases the overall diversification of the company s risk portfolio 
key financial measures in addition to the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income  management uses three key measures to evaluate its financial performance  as well as the overall growth in value generated for the company s common shareholders 
diluted book value per share management uses growth in diluted book value per share as a prime measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s stock price 
diluted book value per share is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common shares outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
diluted book value per share is impacted by the company s net income and external factors such as interest rates and equity markets  which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on its investment portfolio 
since december   the company has generated a compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share in excess of 
roe management uses operating return on beginning shareholders equity roe as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders 
it is calculated using net operating earnings loss available to common shareholders net income or loss excluding net after tax realized gains or losses on investments  net after tax interest in earnings or losses of equity investments and preferred share dividends divided by beginning common shareholders equity 
management has set a minimum roe target over the reinsurance cycle  which management believes provides an attractive return to shareholders for the risk assumed 
each business unit and support department throughout the company is focused on seeking to ensure that the company meets the return objective 
this means that most economic decisions  including capital allocation and underwriting pricing decisions  incorporate an roe impact analysis 
for the purpose of that analysis  an appropriate amount of capital equity is allocated to each transaction for determining the transaction s priced return on deployed capital 
subject to an adequate return for the risk level as well as other factors  such as the contribution of each risk to the overall risk level and risk diversification  capital is allocated to the transactions generating the highest priced return on deployed capital 
management s challenge consists of i allocating an appropriate amount of capital to each transaction based on the incremental risk created by the transaction  ii properly estimating the company s overall risk level and the impact of each transaction on the overall risk level  and iii assessing the diversification benefit  if any  of each transaction 
the risk for the company lies in mis estimating any one of these factors  which are critical in calculating a meaningful priced return on deployed capital  and entering into transactions that do not contribute to the company s roe objective 
combined ratio the combined ratio is used industry wide as a measure of underwriting profitability for non life business 
the combined ratio is the sum of the technical ratio losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned and the other operating expense ratio other operating expenses divided by net premiums earned 
a combined ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  as the total losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and other operating expenses are less than the premiums earned on that 
table of contents business 
while an important metric of success  the combined ratio does not reflect all components of profitability  as it does not recognize the impact of interest income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately made to clients 
since  the company has had five years of underwriting profitability reflected in combined ratios of less than for its non life segment 
in  when the industry recorded its worst year in history in terms of catastrophe losses  with hurricane katrina being the largest insured event ever  the company recorded a net underwriting loss and non life combined ratio of as a result of the significant catastrophic loss events that year 
the key challenges in managing the combined ratio metric consist of i focusing on underwriting profitable business even in the weaker part of the reinsurance cycle  as opposed to growing the book of business at the cost of profitability  ii diversifying the portfolio to achieve a good balance of business  with the expectation that underwriting losses in certain lines or markets may potentially be offset by underwriting profits in other lines or markets  and iii maintaining control over expenses 
other key issues of management enterprise culture management is focused on ensuring that the structure and culture of the organization promote intelligent  prudent  transparent and ethical decision making 
management believes that a sound enterprise culture starts with the tone at the top 
the executive management holds regular company wide information sessions to present and review management s latest decisions  whether operational  financial or structural  as well as the financial results of the company 
employees are encouraged to address questions related to the company s results  strategy or management decisions  either anonymously or otherwise to management so that they can be answered during these information sessions 
management believes that these sessions provide a consistent message to all employees about the company s value of transparency 
management also strives to promote a work environment that i aligns the skill set of individuals with challenges encountered by the company  ii includes segregation of duties to ensure objectivity in decision making  and iii provides a compensation structure that encourages and rewards intelligent and ethical behavior 
to that effect  the company has a written code of business conduct and ethics and provides employees with a direct communication channel to the audit committee in the event they become aware of questionable behavior of management or anyone else 
finally  management believes that building a sound internal control environment  including a strong internal audit function  helps ensure that behaviors are consistent with the company s cultural values 
a key challenge in the reinsurance industry is to create economic value through the intelligent assumption of reinsurance and investment risk  but also to limit or mitigate those risks that can destroy tangible as well as intangible value 
management believes that every organization faces numerous risks that could threaten the successful achievement of a company s goals and objectives 
these include choice of strategy and markets  economic and business cycles  competition  changes in regulation  data quality and security  fraud  business interruption and management continuity  all factors which can be viewed as either strategic or operational risks that are common to any industry 
see risk factors in item a of part i of this report 
in addition to these risks  the company assumes risks and its results are primarily determined by how well the company understands  prices and manages assumed risk 
while many industries and companies start with a return goal and then attempt to shed risks that may derail that goal  the company starts with a capital based risk appetite and then looks for risks that meet its return targets within that framework 
management believes that this construct allows the company to balance the cedants need for absolute certainty of claims payment with shareholders need for an adequate return on their capital 
capital adequacy a key challenge for management is to maintain an appropriate level of capital 
management s first priority is to hold sufficient capital to meet all of the company s obligations to cedants  meet regulatory requirements and support its position as one of the stronger reinsurers in the industry 
holding an excessive amount of capital  however  will reduce the company s roe 
consequently  management closely monitors its capital needs and 
table of contents capital level throughout the cycle  and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the company s capital in order to achieve the proper balance of financial strength and shareholder returns 
capital management is achieved by either deploying capital to fund attractive business opportunities  or in times of excess capital  returning capital to shareholders by way of share repurchases and dividends 
liquidity and cash flows the company aims to be a reliable and financially secure partner to its cedants 
this means that the company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support its cedants by settling claims quickly 
the company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations 
management believes that a profitable  well run reinsurance organization will generate sufficient cash from premium receipts to pay claims  acquisition costs and operating expenses in most years 
to the extent that underwriting cash flows are not sufficient to cover operating outflows in any year  the company may utilize cash flows generated from investments and may ultimately liquidate assets from its investment portfolio 
management ensures that its liquidity requirements are supported by maintaining a high quality  well balanced and liquid portfolio  and by matching the duration of its investment portfolio with that of its net reinsurance liabilities 
in  the company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows 
management also maintains credit facilities with banks that can provide efficient access to cash in the event of an unforeseen cash requirement 
risk management the company s risk management framework encompasses all the meaningful risks faced by the company the strategic risks  including those that it shares with the rest of the reinsurance industry  assumed risks the reinsurance and capital market risks that it is paid to assume and the operational risks that are a part of running any business 
management identifies and categorizes risks in terms of their source  their impact on the company and the preferred strategies for dealing with them 
it takes an integrated approach  because it is impossible to manage any of these risks in isolation 
there are interrelationships and dependencies between the various categories of risk 
each must be viewed in the context of the whole if their potential impact on the organization is to be fully understood and effectively managed 
the board approves maximum limits of the key assumed risks as a percentage of the company s economic value defined below  while the executive management operates at levels equal to or lower than the maximum limits approved by the board 
the actual level of risks is dependent on current market conditions and the need for balance in the company s portfolio of risks 
the strategic risks include the direction and governance of the company  as well as its response to key external factors faced by the reinsurance industry 
operational risks are managed by designated functions within the organization 
they include failures or weaknesses in financial reporting and controls  regulatory non compliance  poor cash management  fraud  breach of information technology security and reliance on third party vendors 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through robust processes and controls 
controls and monitoring processes throughout the organization seek to ensure that the executive management and the board have a comprehensive view of the company s risks and related mitigation strategies at all times 
individual business units manage assumed risks  subject to the limits and policies established by the executive management and the board 
these are the reinsurance risks that the company s clients want to transfer and are the core of the company s business 
they also include the capital market risks that the company assumes in the investment of its assets 
at a strategic level  the company manages these risks through diversification and absolute limits 
at an operational level  risk mitigation strategies for assumed risks include strong processes  technical risk assessment and collaboration among different groups of professionals who each contribute a particular area of expertise 
the company believes that it maintains a risk appetite moderately above the average of the reinsurance market because management believes that this position offers the best potential for creating shareholder value at an acceptable risk level 
the most profitable products generally present the most volatility and potential 
table of contents downside risk 
the company manages that risk through diversification  risk appetite for different risk classes and absolute limits on any one risk 
the company accepts that results on a quarterly basis may be volatile  however  it seeks to protect itself from downside risk that can materially impair its balance sheet 
the limits imposed represent the boundaries of risk tolerance and are based on the amount of capital that may be lost over the return period 
the major risks to the company s balance sheet are typically due to events that management refers to as shock losses 
the company defines a shock loss as an event that has the potential to materially damage economic value 
the company defines its economic value as the difference between the net present value of tangible assets and the net present value of liabilities  using appropriate risk discount rates 
for traded assets  the calculated net present values are equivalent to market values 
there are three areas of risk that the company has currently identified as having the greatest potential for shock losses 
these are catastrophe  reserving for casualty and other long tail lines  and equity investment risk 
the company manages the risk of shock losses by setting limits on its tolerance for specific risks and on the amount of capital that it is willing to expose to such risks 
the company establishes limits to manage the absolute maximum foreseeable loss from any one event and considers the possibility that several shock losses could occur at one time  for example a major catastrophe event accompanied by a collapse in the equity markets 
management believes that the limits that it has placed on shock losses will allow the company to continue writing business in such an event 
other risks such as interest rate risk and credit risk have the ability to impact results substantially and may result in volatility in results from quarter to quarter  but management believes that by themselves  they are unlikely to represent a material downside threat to the company s long term economic value 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this report for additional disclosure on interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
catastrophe risk the company defines this risk as the risk that the aggregate losses from natural perils materially exceed the net premiums that are received to cover such risks 
the company considers both the loss of capital due to a single large event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple but potentially smaller events in any year 
the company imposes an absolute limit to catastrophe risk from any single loss through exposure limit caps in each zone and to each peril  with the largest zonal limit set at a maximum of billion 
the largest zonal limit used at december  was billion 
this risk is managed through the real time allocation of catastrophe exposure capacity on each exposure zone to different business units  regular modeling of aggregate loss scenarios through proprietary models and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis 
a zone is a geographic area in which the insurance risks are considered to be correlated to a single catastrophic event 
not all zones have the same limit and zones are broadly defined so that it would be highly unlikely for any single event to substantially erode the aggregate exposure limits from more than one zone 
even extremely high severity low likelihood events will only partially exhaust the limits in any zone  as they are likely to only affect a part of the area covered by a wide zone 
the company also limits its exposures so that the chance that an economic loss to the company from all catastrophe losses in aggregate in any one year exceeding billion has a modeled probability of occurring less than once in years 
to measure this probability  the company uses proprietary models that take into account not only the exposures in any zone  but also the likely frequency and severity of catastrophic events 
this quantitative analysis is supplemented with the professional judgment of experienced underwriters 
at december   the modeled economic loss to the company from a one in year catastrophic loss was million  in aggregate  for all zones 

table of contents casualty reserving risk the company defines this risk as the risk that the estimates of ultimate losses that underlie its booked reserves for casualty and other long tail lines will prove to be too low  leading to substantial reserve strengthening 
the tolerance set by the company for this risk is measured using total earned premium for casualty and other long tail lines for the four most recent underwriting periods 
total earned premiums for casualty and other long tail lines for the four most recent underwriting periods was limited to a maximum of billion  compared to an actual of billion  as of december  one of the greatest risks in long tail lines of business  and particularly in us casualty  is that the loss trends are higher than the assumptions underlying the company s ultimate loss estimates  resulting in ultimate losses that exceed recorded loss reserves 
when loss trends prove to be higher than those underlying the reserving assumptions  the risk is great because of a stacking up effect for long tail lines  the company carries reserves to cover claims arising from several years of underwriting activity and these reserves are likely to be adversely affected by unfavorable loss trends 
the effect is likely to be more pronounced for recent underwriting years because  with the passage of time  actual loss emergence and data provide greater confidence around the adequacy of ultimate liability estimates for older underwriting years 
management believes that the volume of long tail business most exposed to these reserving uncertainties should be limited 
the company manages and mitigates the reserve risk for long tail lines in a variety of ways 
underwriters and pricing actuaries follow a disciplined underwriting process that utilizes all available data and information  including industry trends 
the company establishes prudent reserving policies for determining carried reserves 
these policies are systematic and management endeavors to apply them consistently over time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits below 
equity investment risk the company defines this risk as the risk of a substantial decline in the value of its equity and equity like securities defined as all securities  including private investments  other than investment grade securities during the year 
the tolerance set by the company for this risk is measured using the value of equity and equity like securities as a percentage of economic capital and was set at a maximum of billion  compared to an actual of billion  as of december  assuming equity risk and equity like risks such as high yield bonds and convertible securities within that part of the investment portfolio that is not required to support liability funds provides valuable diversification from other risk classes  along with the potential for higher returns 
however  an overweight position could lead to a large loss of capital and impair the balance sheet in the case of a market crash 
the company sets strict limits on investments in any one name and any one industry  which creates a diversified portfolio and allows management to focus on the systemic effects of equity risks 
systemic risk is managed by asset allocation  subject to strict caps on other than investment grade bonds as a percentage of capital 
the company s fully integrated information system provides real time data on the investment portfolios  allowing for continuous monitoring and decision support 
each portfolio is managed against a pre determined benchmark to enable alignment with appropriate risk parameters and achievement of desired returns 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk equity price risk in item a of part ii of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and 
table of contents estimates used by management  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
these critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  including note  significant accounting policies  for a full understanding of the company s accounting policies 
the sensitivity estimates that follow are based on outcomes that the company considers reasonably likely to occur 
losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits losses and loss expenses because a significant amount of time can elapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company the primary company or the cedant  the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company the reinsurer and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer  the company s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses loss reserves is based largely upon estimates 
the company categorizes loss reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  additional case reserves acrs and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
acrs are established for particular circumstances where  on the basis of individual loss reports  the company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves and acrs 
unlike case reserves and acrs  ibnr reserves are often calculated at an aggregated level and cannot usually be directly identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
the company also estimates the future unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae associated with the loss reserves and these form part of the company s loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company s non life loss reserves for each category  line and sub segment are reported in the tables included later in this section 
the amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail 
lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines  and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long tail lines 
in general  for reinsurance  the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer s 
the delay varies by reinsurance market country of cedant  type of treaty  whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss 
the delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer 
the company considers agriculture  catastrophe  energy  property  motor business written in the us  proportional motor business written outside of the us  specialty property and structured risk to be short tail lines  aviation space  credit surety  engineering  marine and multiline to be medium tail lines  and casualty  non proportional motor business written outside of the us and specialty casualty to be long tail lines of business 
for all lines  the company s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses 
total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid 
similarly  ibnr reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and acrs from total loss reserves 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells 
the company assigns treaties to reserving cells and allocates losses from the treaty to the reserving cell 
the reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics eg  reporting tail but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible 
the selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the company evolves 
for each reserving cell  the company tabulates losses in reserving triangles that show the total reported or paid claims at each financial year end by underwriting year cohort 
an underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred accident year  
table of contents or the calendar year for which financial results are reported 
for each reserving cell  the company s estimates of loss reserves are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies 
in selecting its best estimate  the company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid and reported chain ladder methods  expected loss ratio method  paid and reported bornhuetter ferguson b f methods  and paid and reported benktander methods 
in addition  the company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims 
for example  internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer 
in the case of asbestos and environmental claims  the company has established reserves for future losses and allocated loss expenses based on the results of periodic actuarial studies  which consider the underlying exposures of the company s cedants 
the reserve methodologies employed by the company are dependent on data that the company collects 
this data consists primarily of loss amounts and loss payments reported by the company s cedants  and premiums written and earned reported by cedants or estimated by the company 
the actuarial methods used by the company to project loss reserves that it will pay in the future future liabilities do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported  claim counts settled or claim counts open as  due to the nature of the company s business  this information is not routinely provided by cedants for every treaty 
consequently  actuarial methods relying on this information cannot be used by the company to estimate loss reserves 
a brief description of the reserving methods commonly employed by the company and a discussion of their particular advantages and disadvantages follows chain ladder cl development methods reported or paid these methods use the underlying assumption that losses reported paid for each underwriting year at a particular development stage follow a stable pattern 
for example  the cl development method assumes that on average  every underwriting year will display the same percentage of ultimate liabilities reported by the company s cedants say x at months after the inception of the underwriting year 
the percentages reported paid are established for each development stage eg  at months  months  etc 
after examining historical averages from the loss development data 
these are sometimes supplemented by external benchmark information 
ultimate liabilities are estimated by multiplying the actual reported paid losses by the reciprocal of the assumed reported paid percentage eg  x 
reserves are then calculated by subtracting paid claims from the estimated ultimate liabilities 
the main strengths of the method are that it is reactive to loss emergence payments and that it makes full use of historical experience on claim emergence payments 
for homogeneous low volatility lines  under stable economic conditions the method can often produce good estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
however  the method has weaknesses when the underlying assumption of stable patterns is not true 
this may be the consequence of changes in the mix of business  changes in claim inflation trends  changes in claim reporting practices or the presence of large claims  among other things 
furthermore  the method tends to produce volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities in situations where there is volatility in reported paid patterns 
in particular  when the expected percentage reported paid is low  small deviations between actual and expected claims can lead to very volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
consequently  this method is often unsuitable for projections at early development stages of an underwriting year 
finally  the method fails to incorporate any information regarding market conditions  pricing  etc  which could improve the estimate of liabilities and reserves 
it therefore tends not to perform very well in situations where there are rapidly changing market conditions 

table of contents expected loss ratio elr method this method estimates ultimate losses for an underwriting year by applying an estimated loss ratio to the earned premium for that underwriting year 
although the method is insensitive to actual reported or paid losses  it can often be useful at the early stages of development when very few losses have been reported or paid  and the principal sources of information available to the company consist of information obtained during pricing and qualitative information supplied by the cedant 
however  the lack of sensitivity to reported or paid losses means that the method is usually inappropriate at later stages of development 
bornhuetter ferguson b f methods reported or paid these methods aim to address the concerns of the chain ladder development methods  which are the variability at early stages of development and the failure to incorporate external information such as pricing 
however  the b f methods are more sensitive to reported and paid losses than the expected loss ratio method above  and can be seen as a blend of the expected loss ratio and chain ladder development methods 
unreported unpaid claims are calculated using an expected reporting payment pattern and an externally determined estimate of ultimate liabilities usually determined by multiplying an a priori loss ratio with estimates of premium volume 
the accuracy of the a priori loss ratio is a critical assumption in this method 
usually a priori loss ratios are initially determined on the basis of pricing information  but may also be adjusted to reflect other information that subsequently emerges about underlying loss experience 
although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment  this method can be slow to react to emerging loss development payment 
in particular  to the extent that the a priori loss ratios prove to be inaccurate and are not revised  the b f methods will produce loss estimates that take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss liabilities 
benktander b k methods reported or paid these methods can be viewed as a blend between the chain ladder development and the b f methods described above 
the blend is based on predetermined weights at each development stage that depend on the reported paid development patterns 
although mitigated to some extent  this method still exhibits the same advantages and disadvantages as the b f method  but the mechanics of the calculation imply that it is more reactive to loss emergence payment than the b f method 
in determining the company s loss reserves  the selected best estimate is often a blend of the results from two or more methods eg  weighted averages 
the judgment as to which method s is most appropriate for a particular underwriting year and reserving cell could change over time as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other data issues 
furthermore  as each line is typically composed of several reserving cells  it is likely that the reserves for the line will be dependent on several reserving methods 
this is because reserves for a line are the result of aggregating the reserves for each constituent reserving cell and that a different method could be selected for each reserving cell 
although it is not appropriate to refer to reserves for a line as being determined by a particular method  the table below summarizes the methods that were given principal weight in selecting the best estimates of reserves in each reserving line and can therefore be viewed as key drivers of selected reserves 
the table distinguishes methods for mature and immature underwriting years  as they are often different 
the definition of maturity is specific to a line and is related to the reporting tail 
if at the reserve evaluation date  a significant proportion of losses for the underwriting year are expected to have been reported  then the underwriting year is deemed to be mature  otherwise it is deemed to be immature 
for short tail lines  such as property or agriculture  immature years can refer to the one or two most recent underwriting years  while for longer tail lines  such as casualty  immature years can refer to the three or four most recent underwriting years

the reserving methods used by the company are dependent on a number of key parameter assumptions 
the principal parameter assumptions underlying the methods used by the company are i the loss development factors used to form an expectation of the evolution of reported and paid claims for several years following the inception of the underwriting year 
these are often derived by examining the company s data after due consideration of the underlying factors listed below 
in some cases  where the company lacks sufficient volume to have statistical credibility  external benchmarks are used to supplement the company s data  ii the tail factors used to reflect development of paid and reported losses after several years have elapsed since the inception of the underwriting year  iii the a priori loss ratios used as inputs in the b f methods  and iv the selected loss ratios used as inputs in the expected loss ratio method 
the validity of all parameter assumptions used in the reserving process is reaffirmed on a quarterly basis 
reaffirmation of the parameter assumptions means that the actuaries determine that the parameter assumptions 
table of contents continue to form a sound basis for projection of future liabilities 
parameter assumptions used in projecting future liabilities are themselves estimates based on historical information 
as new information becomes available eg  additional losses reported  the company s actuaries determine whether a revised estimate of the parameter assumptions that reflects all available information is consistent with the previous parameter assumptions employed 
in general  to the extent that the revised estimate of parameter assumptions are within a close range of the original assumptions  the company determines that the parameter assumptions employed continue to form an appropriate basis for projections and continue to use the original assumptions in its models 
in this case  any differences could be attributed to the imprecise nature of the parameter estimation process 
however  to the extent that the deviations between the two sets of estimates are not within a close range of the original assumptions  the company reacts by adopting the revised assumptions as a basis for its reserve models 
notwithstanding the above  even where the company has experienced no material deviations from its original assumptions during any quarter  the company will generally revise the reserving parameter assumptions at least once a year to reflect all accumulated available information 
in addition to examining the data  the selection of the parameter assumptions is dependent on several underlying factors 
the company s actuaries review these underlying factors and determine the extent to which these are likely to be stable over the time frame during which losses are projected  and the extent to which these factors are consistent with the company s data 
if these factors are determined to be stable and consistent with the data  the estimation of the reserving parameter assumptions are mainly carried out using actuarial and statistical techniques applied to the company s data 
to the extent that the actuaries determine that they cannot continue to rely on the stability of these factors  the statistical estimates of parameter assumptions are modified to reflect the direction of the change 
the main underlying factors upon which the estimates of reserving parameters are predicated are i the cedant s business practices will proceed as in the past with no material changes either in submission of accounts or cash flows  ii any internal delays in processing accounts received by the cedant are not materially different from that experienced historically  and hence the implicit reserving allowance made in loss reserves through the methods continues to be appropriate  iii case reserve reporting practices  particularly the methodologies used to establish and report case reserves  are unchanged from historical practices  iv the company s internal claim practices  particularly the level and extent of use of acrs are unchanged  v historical levels of claim inflation can be projected into the future and will have no material effect on either the acceleration or deceleration of claim reporting and payment patterns  vi the selection of reserving cells results in homogeneous and credible future expectations for all business in the cell and any changes in underlying treaty terms are either reflected in cell selection or explicitly allowed in the selection of trends  vii in cases where benchmarks are used  they are derived from the experience of similar business  and viii the company can form a credible initial expectation of the ultimate loss ratio of recent underwriting years through a review of pricing information  supplemented by qualitative information on market events 
the company s best estimate of total loss reserves is typically in excess of the midpoint of the actuarial reserve estimates 
the company believes that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long tail lines of business and for immature underwriting years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies 
as discussed above  these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future 
in selecting its best estimate of future liabilities  the company considers both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves as well as the potential variability of these 
table of contents estimates as captured by a reasonable range of actuarial reserve estimates 
selected reserves are always within the indicated reasonable range of estimates indicated by the company s actuaries 
in determining the appropriate best estimate  the company reviews i the position of overall reserves within the actuarial reserve range  ii the result of bottom up analysis by underwriting year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations  and iii specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial mid estimates  such as potential for outstanding litigation  claims practices of cedants  etc 
during  and  the company reviewed its estimate for prior year losses for each sub segment of the non life segment and  in light of developing data  determined to adjust its ultimate loss ratios for prior accident years

table of contents the following paragraphs discuss how losses paid and reported during the year ended december  compared with the company s expectations  and how the company modified its reserving parameter assumptions in line with the emerging development in each reserving line 
property aggregate losses reported for the us property line were lower than expected  and the company selected reserving methods that gave a greater weight to the observed development mainly for the underwriting year 
losses reported for the non us property line were lower than expected for all years except the underwriting year  and the company reflected this experience by using reserving methods that give more weight to the actual development and by lowering its loss ratio picks for those years 
casualty aggregate losses reported and paid for the non us casualty line were significantly below the company s expectations for all underwriting years  and the company reflected this experience by lowering its loss ratio picks 
this change was partially offset by an increase in a priori loss ratios  mainly in france 
aggregate losses reported for the us casualty line were lower than expected mainly for the underwriting years  but higher than expected for underwriting years and prior 
the company reduced loss ratio picks for recent years due to this favorable experience and used reserving methods giving more weight to the actual experience for the recent years  which was partially offset by lengthening the loss development factors for underwriting years and prior 
multiline aggregate reported losses were higher than expected for underwriting years and prior 
the company reflected this experience by selecting slightly higher tail factors and longer loss development patterns 
motor aggregate losses reported for the us motor line were slightly lower than expected 
the company reflected this development by selecting lower loss ratios  mainly in the underwriting year 
aggregate losses reported for the non us motor proportional line were slightly lower than expected in most underwriting years  and the company reflected this experience by selecting lower loss ratios 
aggregate losses reported and paid for the non us motor non proportional line were significantly lower than expectations in most countries except france 
the company did not materially change its loss development assumptions in those countries except for france due to the long tail nature of the exposure  but reduced loss ratio picks to reflect the positive experience 
in france  reported losses were slightly higher than expectations  and the company increased its a priori loss ratios and loss ratio picks 
agriculture the aggregate losses reported during the year were modestly below the company s expectations  primarily for the and underwriting years 
the company lowered its loss ratio picks for those years  but did not otherwise materially alter its reserving assumptions 
aviation space the overall losses reported during the year were significantly lower than the company s expectations  primarily for the underwriting year  but the effect was uniform across all underwriting years 
the company reflected this experience by selecting faster development patterns and selecting lower loss ratios 
catastrophe losses reported in this line are largely a function of the presence or absence of catastrophic events during the year 
losses reported in respect of prior year catastrophe events were overall in line with expectations 
however  the company reduced its reserves for the us catastrophe losses as a result of reduced concerns on litigation developments that may affect some of the company s cedants in the future and hence the claims reported to the company 
credit surety the aggregate losses reported during the year were significantly lower than expected  primarily for the underwriting year  but also for several more mature underwriting years 
the company reduced loss ratio picks particularly for the year due to this favorable experience  and also reduced its loss development factors 

table of contents engineering the aggregate reported losses were modestly lower than expectations 
the company did not materially change its reserving assumptions  but reflected this experience by selecting lower loss ratios 
energy onshore aggregate reported losses were significantly lower than expected  although to a large extent this is due to the relative absence of large losses during the and calendar years  as loss reporting for this line is very sensitive to the presence or absence of large losses 
the company did not materially change its reserving assumptions for this line 
marine energy offshore the aggregate reported losses during the year were significantly lower than expected  especially for the underwriting year 
the company reflected this favorable experience by reducing its loss development factor assumptions and loss ratio selections for underwriting years and prior 
as an example of the sensitivity of the company s reserves to reserving parameter assumptions  the tables below summarize  by reserving line  the effect on the company s reserves of higher lower a priori loss ratio selections  higher lower loss development factors and higher lower tail factors 
the company believes that the illustrated sensitivity to the reserving parameter assumptions is indicative of the potential variability inherent in the estimation process of those parameters

table of contents some reserving lines show little sensitivity to a priori loss ratio  loss development factor or tail factor as the company may use reserving methods such as the expected loss ratio method in several of its reserving cells within those lines 
it is not appropriate to add together the total impact for a specific factor or the total impact for a specific reserving line as the lines of business are not perfectly correlated 
case reserves are reported to the company by its cedants  while acrs and ibnr are estimated by the company

loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
in the event that the business environment and social trends diverge from historical trends  the company may have to adjust its loss reserves to amounts falling significantly outside its current estimate 
management believes that the recorded loss reserves represent its best estimate of future liabilities based on information available as of december  the estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the period in which the need for an adjustment is determined 
the company estimates its net loss reserves using single actuarial point estimates 
ranges around these actuarial point estimates are developed using stochastic simulations and techniques and provide an indication as to the degree of variability of the loss reserves 
the company interprets the ranges produced by these techniques as confidence intervals around the company s best estimates for each non life sub segment 
however  due to the inherent volatility in the business written by the company  there can be no guarantee that the final settlement of the loss reserves will fall within these ranges

during  the industry began to recognize an increased likelihood of losses associated with sub prime mortgage related risk exposures 
the majority of the company s underwriting exposure related to this issue  if any  arises from business written in us specialty casualty  primarily directors and officers exposures  during the underwriting years  and the company also has potential exposure  to a lesser extent  to this issue arising from business written in us surety and global non us specialty casualty 
given the information available to date  ultimate losses from this event  if any  cannot be estimated by standard actuarial techniques 
to estimate a range of potential losses  the company performed analyses based on information received from cedants at the time the exposed business was written  current industry data regarding the likelihood of securities class actions and other potential suits against companies exposed more directly to sub prime mortgages  estimates of exposed industry premium  estimates of the company s market share of exposed industry premium and estimates of industry wide insured losses 
a significant degree of judgment was used to estimate the range of potential losses and there is a considerable degree of uncertainty related to the range of possible ultimate liabilities 
based on information currently available and the range of potential estimated ultimate liabilities  the company believes that the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for us specialty casualty and other potentially exposed classes of business contemplate a reasonable provision for exposures related to potential sub prime mortgage risks 
the company is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its unpaid losses and loss expense estimates related to this exposure 
the company s unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at december  for us specialty casualty were  million  of which million relates to the  and underwriting years 
included in the business that is considered to have a long reporting tail is the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses as of december  included million that represents an estimate of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims 
the majority of this loss and loss expense reserve relates to us casualty exposures arising from business written by partnerre sa and partnerre us see note to consolidated financial statements 
life policy benefits policy benefits for life and annuity contracts relate to the business in the company s life operations  which predominately include reinsurance of longevity  subdivided into standard and non standard annuities  and 
table of contents mortality business  which includes traditional death and disability covers with various riders  term assurance and critical illness tci written in the uk and ireland  and guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb written in continental europe 
the company categorizes life reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves 
reserves for future policy benefits  which relate to future events occurring on policies in force over an extended period of time  are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with us gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits have been determined based upon information reported by cedants  supplemented by the company s estimates of mortality  morbidity  persistency  expenses and future investment income  with appropriate provision to reflect uncertainty 
for the traditional life portfolio  case reserves  ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits are mainly calculated at the treaty level 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
for the products that are covered by the long duration provisions of sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas  a reserve adequacy test is performed at least once a year based on the latest best estimate assumptions by line of business  including an experience analysis and a review of likely future experience 
if such review produces reserves in excess of those currently held  then the locked in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized 
longevity the reserving methodology for the annuity portfolio of reinsurance contracts within the longevity book is in accordance with sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments sfas 
many of these contracts subject the company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected 
annuity payments and expenses for policies within the annuity reinsurance portfolio are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows 
assumptions for each element mortality  expenses and interest are determined at the issue of the contract and are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists 
the assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements ie  mortality and interest 
provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract 
for standard annuities  the main risk is a faster increase in future life span than expected in the medium to long term 
non standard annuities are annuities sold to people with aggravated heath conditions and are usually medically underwritten on an individual basis 
the main risk in non standard annuities is an inadequate assessment of the future life span of the people insured 
for the year ended december   the company increased net prior year reserves by million  including million of loss recognition as required by sfas for the impaired life annuity portfolio 
the increase in net prior year reserves was due to worse than expected loss development in the year and a change in assumptions used to value future policy benefits for the non standard annuity business 
for the year ended december   the company increased net prior year reserves by million due to higher losses reported by cedants 
the longevity line reported no development on prior accident years in 
table of contents mortality the reserves for the short term traditional mortality business are established in accordance with the short duration provisions of sfas they consist of case reserves and ibnr  calculated at the treaty level based upon cedant information and use the expected loss ratio method  described in the losses and loss expenses section above 
given the very short term loss development of this portion of the portfolio  this method is appropriate for the life short term portfolio 
the reserves for the long term traditional mortality and tci reinsurance portfolio are established in accordance with the long duration provisions of sfas assumptions for each element mortality  critical illness  lapses  expenses and interest are determined at the issue of the contract and are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists 
the assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements ie  mortality  critical illness  lapses and interest 
the reserves for the gmdb reinsurance business are established in accordance with the universal life provisions of sfas key assumptions for this business are mortality  lapses  interest rates and stock market performance 
for the last parameter  a stochastic option pricing approach is used and the benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the respective underlying funds correlated to the eurostoxx or the cac index 
the company regularly evaluates the assumptions used and adjusts them if actual experience or other evidence suggests that the earlier assumptions should be revised 
for the year ended december   the company decreased net prior year reserves by million 
the reduction in net prior year reserves was predominately due to favorable reserve development on long and short term traditional mortality products and tci 
for the year ended december   the company decreased net prior year reserves by million due to the refinement of the company s reserving methodologies related to certain gmdb treaties and the receipt of additional reported loss information from cedants

table of contents it is not appropriate to sum the total impact for a specific line or the total impact for a specific factor because the reinsurance portfolios are not perfectly correlated 
premiums and acquisition costs the company provides proportional and non proportional reinsurance coverage to cedants insurance companies 
in most cases  cedants seek protection for business that they have not yet written at the time they enter into reinsurance agreements and have to estimate the volume of premiums they will cede to the company 
reporting delays are inherent in the reinsurance industry and vary in length by reinsurance market country of cedant and type of treaty 
as delays can vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer  the company produces accounting estimates to report premiums and acquisition costs until it receives the cedants actual results 
approximately of the company s reported net premiums written for  and were based upon estimates 
under proportional treaties  which represented of gross premiums written for the year december   the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant and pays the cedant a commission to cover the cedant s acquisition costs 
under this type of treaty  the company s ultimate premiums written and earned and acquisition costs are not known at the inception of the treaty and must be estimated until the cedant reports its actual results to the company 
under non proportional treaties  which represented of gross premiums written for the year december   the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio and receives a fixed or minimum premium  which is subject to upward adjustment depending on the premium volume written by the cedant 
reported premiums written and earned and acquisition costs on proportional treaties are generally based upon reports received from cedants and brokers  supplemented by the company s own estimates of premiums written and acquisition costs for which ceding company reports have not been received 
premium and acquisition cost estimates are determined at the individual treaty level 
the determination of estimates requires a review of the company s experience with cedants  familiarity with each geographic market  a thorough understanding of the individual characteristics of each line of business and the ability to project the impact of current economic indicators on the volume of business written and ceded by the company s cedants 
estimates for premiums and acquisition costs are updated continuously as new information is received from the cedants 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
the magnitude and impact of a change in premium estimate differs for proportional and non proportional treaties 
non proportional treaties generally include a fixed minimum premium and an adjustment premium  which is generally less than of the fixed minimum premium 
while fixed minimum premiums require no estimation  adjustment premiums are estimated and could be subject to changes in estimates 
although proportional treaties may be subject to larger changes in premium estimates  as the company generally receives cedant statements in arrears and must estimate all premiums for periods ranging from one month to more than one year depending on the frequency of cedant statements  the pre tax impact is mitigated by changes in the cedant s related reported acquisition costs and losses 
the impact of the change in estimate on premiums earned and pre tax results varies depending on when the change becomes known during the risk period and the underlying profitability of the treaty 
for the year ended december   the company recorded reductions of million and million of net premiums written and net premiums earned  respectively  related to changes in non life premium estimates of prior year reported premiums 
these reductions  after the corresponding adjustments to acquisition costs and losses and loss expenses  decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
a increase decrease in net premium written estimates and the corresponding acquisition costs for all of the company s non life non proportional treaties would increase decrease the pre tax income by approximately million  assuming the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 

table of contents for proportional treaties  the impact of a change in net premium written estimates on pre tax income varies depending on the losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs of the treaty affected by the change 
for example  a increase decrease in net premiums written and the corresponding acquisition costs and losses in across all non life proportional treaties would increase decrease pre tax income by approximately million  assuming the reported technical ratio and that the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 
acquisition costs  primarily brokerage fees  commissions and excise taxes  which vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition of reinsurance contracts  are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium is earned 
the recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
deferred policy acquisition costs recoverability testing is performed at least once a year together with the reserve adequacy test  based on the latest best estimate assumptions by line of business 
a increase decrease in acquisition costs for all of the company s non life treaties both proportional and non proportional for the year ended december   would decrease increase pre tax income by approximately million  assuming no change in premium estimates and that the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period 
other than temporary impairment of investments the company regularly evaluates the fair value of its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis original cost basis for equities is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the amortized cost of the individual security is written down to fair value as its new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income in the period in which the determination of other than temporary impairment is made 
in contrast  temporary losses are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income  but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately as realized losses in net income 
to determine whether securities with unrealized investment losses are impaired  the company evaluates  for each specific issuer or security  whether events have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its investment in the security 
in the determination of other than temporary impairment  the company considers several factors and circumstances  including general economic and financial market conditions  the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time for which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below cost or amortized cost on a continuous basis  and other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
during  and  the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the company held approximately investment positions that carried total gross unrealized losses of million  including million on securities that carried unrealized losses for more than continuous months 
most unrealized losses were caused by increases in interest rates since the company s purchase of the investments  and the company intends to hold these investments until recovery 
also in management s judgment  the company had no significant unrealized losses caused by other factors or circumstances  including an issuer s specific corporate risk or due to industry or geographic risk  for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken 
if the company had written down of all securities that were in an unrealized loss position for more than continuous months at december   net income for would have been reduced by million  pre tax 
however  there would be no change in the company s carrying value of investments  comprehensive income or shareholders equity  as the realization of the unrealized market value depreciation would transfer the loss from the accumulated other comprehensive income section of the consolidated balance sheet to net income on the consolidated statement of operations and retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents following the adoption of sfas on january   the company will no longer be required to determine whether its available for sale investments are impaired and will not be required to record other than temporary impairment charges as changes in market value will be recorded in net income

fin 
see note i and note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the company has estimated the future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and has a deferred tax asset at december  of million 
the most significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to loss reserve discounting for tax purposes in the united states and operating tax loss carryforwards in france 
at december   the deferred tax asset relating to the french tax loss carryforward was million  which is subject to an indefinite carryforward period 
the company has projected future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise 
these projections are based on management s projections of premium and investment income  and technical and expense ratios 
based on these projections  management evaluates the need for a valuation allowance 
the company did not have any valuation allowance at december  or a reduction in the deferred tax asset of million as of december  would result in a million charge to net income and a corresponding reduction in total assets 
the deferred tax liabilities as of december  were million 
in accordance with sfas  the company has assumed that the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities will result in an increase in taxes payable in future years 
underlying this assumption is an expectation that the company will continue to be subject to taxation in the various tax jurisdictions and the company will continue to generate taxable revenues in excess of deductions 
a reduction in the deferred tax liability as of december  would result in a tax benefit of million booked to net income and a corresponding reduction in total liabilities 
the company s unrecognized tax benefit related to fin was million at december  a reduction in the unrecognized tax benefit as of december  would result in a tax benefit of million booked to net income and a corresponding reduction in total liabilities 
goodwill sfas requires that the company make an annual assessment as to whether the value of the company s goodwill asset is impaired 
impairment  which can be either partial or full  is based on a fair value analysis by individual reporting unit 
based upon the company s assessment at the reporting unit level  there was no impairment of its goodwill asset of million as of december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income in addition to forecasts of future cash flows and future profits 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial 
table of contents performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
if a decline in the fair value of the reporting units occurred  this would not result in an impairment of the goodwill asset at december  valuation of certain derivative financial instruments the company has entered into non traded weather derivatives and total return and interest rate swaps 
the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they are recorded 
the company recorded a loss of million  income of million and income of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company uses internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these derivatives and develops assumptions that require significant judgment  such as the timing of future cash flows of reference securities  credit spreads and general levels of interest rates 
the company uses its best estimate of assumptions to estimate the fair value of its derivative positions 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in a significantly different valuation of the derivatives and significant adjustments to net income in the period in which the company makes the adjustment 
on aggregate  the company is not significantly exposed to changes in the valuation of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
however  at december   the company estimated that a basis point increase or decrease in all risk spread assumptions used in the company s internal valuation models would result in a million decrease or increase  respectively  in the fair value of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio 
the company is exposed to changes in the expected amount of future cash flows of the reference assets in its total return swap portfolio 
the company s total return swap portfolio references many different underlying assets with a number of risk factors 
at december   the notional value of the total return swap portfolio was million and the fair value of the assets underlying the total return swap portfolio was million 
the company estimated that each increase or decrease in the amount of all expected future cash flows related to the reference assets would result in a million increase or decrease  respectively  in the fair value of its total return swap portfolio 
for weather derivatives  the company develops assumptions for weather measurements as of the valuation date of the derivative and for probable future weather observations based on forecasts and statistical analysis of historical data 
at december   the company estimated that the valuation of its outstanding weather derivative contract could either increase or decrease by up to million based on historical and forecasted weather patterns known as of that date 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties 
see item a of part i of this report for a complete list of the company s risk factors 
any of these risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
the company s reporting currency is the u 
s dollar 
the company s subsidiaries and branches have one of the following functional currencies us dollar  euro or canadian dollar 
as a significant portion of the company s operations is transacted in foreign currencies  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect year over year comparisons 
to the extent that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect comparisons  their impact has been quantified  when possible  and discussed in each of the relevant sections 
see note j to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion on translation of foreign currencies 

table of contents the foreign exchange fluctuations for the principal currencies in which the company transacts business were as follows the us dollar weakened  on average  against the euro and other currencies  except for the japanese yen  in compared to  the us dollar strengthened  on average  against the euro and other currencies  except the canadian dollar  in compared to  and the us dollar weakened against most currencies at december  compared to december  overview the company measures its performance in several ways 
among the performance measures accepted under us gaap is diluted net income per share  a measure that focuses on the return provided to the company s common shareholders 
diluted net income per share is obtained by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding 
net income available to common shareholders is defined as net income less preferred dividends 
as the effect of dilutive securities would have been antidilutive in due to the company s reported net loss  the fully diluted per share figure for the year ended december  was compiled using the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
as the company s reinsurance operations are exposed to low frequency high severity risk events  some of which are seasonal  results for certain years may include unusually low loss experience  while results for other years may include significant catastrophic losses 
for example  the company s results for and included losses from large catastrophic events  while included no significant catastrophic loss 
to the extent that losses related to large catastrophic events affect the year over year comparison of the company s results  their impact has been quantified and discussed in each of the relevant sections 
net income or loss  preferred dividends  net income or loss available to common shareholders and diluted net income or loss per share for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars  except per share data net income loss less preferred dividends net income loss available to common shareholders diluted net income loss per share net income  net income available to common shareholders and diluted net income per share for have decreased compared to  primarily as a result of higher net realized investment losses  losses from the company s interest in the results of equity investments and other losses from the company s principal finance line  which were partially offset by an increase in the non life underwriting result  higher net investment income and a lower income tax expense compared to net income  net income available to common shareholders and diluted net income per share for increased significantly compared to  primarily as a result of a lower level of large catastrophic losses in results for included pre tax losses  net of reinstatement and additional premiums  of million related to european windstorm erwin  the central european floods  and hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma jointly referred to as the large catastrophic loss events 
review of net income loss management analyzes the company s net income loss in three parts underwriting result  investment results and other components of net income 
underwriting result consists of net premiums earned and other 
table of contents income or loss less losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits  acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
net investment income includes interest and dividends  net of investment expenses  generated by the company s investment portfolio  as well as interest income generated on funds held  principal finance and insurance linked securities transactions 
net realized investment gains and losses includes the sales of the company s fixed income and equity investments  other than temporary impairment charges and other net realized and unrealized gains and losses 
interest in earnings or losses of equity investments includes the company s strategic investments  including channelre holdings 
other components of net income include other income or loss  other operating expenses  interest expense  net foreign exchange gains and losses and income tax expense 
the components of net income loss for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars change over change over underwriting result non life nm life investment result net investment income net realized investment losses gains nm interest in losses earnings of equity investments nm corporate and other technical result nm other loss income nm other operating expenses interest expense net foreign exchange losses nm income tax expense net income loss nm nm not meaningful underwriting result is a key measurement that the company uses to manage and evaluate its non life and life segments and its non life sub segments  as it is a primary measure of underlying profitability for the company s core reinsurance operations  separate from the investment results 
the company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its profitability  it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of net income separately and in the aggregate 
underwriting result should not be considered a substitute for net income as it does not reflect the overall profitability of the business  which is also impacted by investment results and other items 
over the underwriting result for the non life segment increased by million  from million in to million in the increase was principally attributable to an increase of million in net favorable development on prior accident year losses  from million in to million in  and an increase in the volume of premiums earned of million and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in the level of large catastrophic losses of million  net of reinstatement premiums  relating to european windstorm kyrill in  and an increase in other operating expenses of million 

table of contents the components of the net favorable loss development are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in the next section 
underwriting result for the life segment decreased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in  primarily due to a decrease of million in net prior year reserve development in compared to  and higher operating expenses  partially offset by an increase in profitability in the mortality line 
the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the increase in the asset base resulting from the investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which totaled  million in and from higher reinvestment rates during changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed of the increase as a result of the weakening of the us dollar  on average  in compared net realized investment losses gains decreased by million  from a gain of million in to a loss of million in  mainly due to an increase in other than temporary impairment charges of million in over realized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors  with the most significant being the prevailing interest rates and equity market conditions  the timing of disposition of fixed maturities and equity securities  and charges for the recognition of other than temporary impairments in the company s investment portfolio 
the other than temporary impairment charges were primarily due to the increase in interest rates and to equity securities with large unrealized loss positions that were written down 
see net realized investment losses gains for more details on other realized gain and loss activity 
interest in the results of equity investments decreased from income of million in to a loss of million in  primarily due to the write down of the company s investment in channelre holdings due to unrealized mark to market losses of channel reinsurance s credit derivative portfolio 
see the discussion in corporate and other below 
technical results and other loss income are from principal finance transactions and insurance linked securities 
the increase of million in the technical result for compared to resulted primarily from the insurance linked securities line 
the decrease of million in other loss income in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease of million from the principal finance line due to write downs and mark to market adjustments on various transactions in  while benefited from accelerated profit recognition on the early termination of a number of long term contracts 
see the discussion in corporate and other below 
other operating expenses included in corporate and other increased by million  primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and increases in consulting and professional fees 
interest expense decreased by million in compared to  primarily due to an expense of million incurred in december upon the redemption of the company s trust preferred securities  representing the unamortized portion of the trust preferred securities issuance costs 
net foreign exchange losses were million and million in and  respectively 
the company hedges a significant portion of its currency risk exposure  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this report 
the decrease in the foreign exchange loss in is largely a function of the comparative interest rate differential between the functional currency of the reporting unit and the currency being hedged  which decreased the cost of hedging instruments used by the company  currency movements against the company s functional currencies for unhedged positions  and the difference between the period end foreign exchange rates  which are used to revalue the balance sheet  and the average foreign exchange rates  which are used to revalue the income statement 
income tax expense decreased by million  from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a tax benefit of million in due to a net reduction of the fin liability 
table of contents for unrecognized tax benefits relating primarily to the expiration of various statutes of limitations and completion of tax audits  and from a favorable tax benefit of million related to the weakening of the us dollar against the swiss franc and the euro 
over the underwriting result for the non life segment increased by  million  from a loss of million in to a gain of million in the increase was principally attributable to a decrease in the level of large catastrophic losses of million  net of reinstatement premiums  an increase in the volume of premiums earned of million and normal fluctuations in profitability between periods of approximately million  and an increase of million in net favorable reserve development on prior accident years  from million in to million in  including net adverse development of million net of reinstatement premiums of million related to the large catastrophic loss events  and was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of million  resulting primarily from higher bonus accruals in the components of the net favorable loss development are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in the next section 
underwriting result for the life segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in  primarily due to the increase of million in net favorable reserve development in compared to  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the increase in the asset base resulting from the investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which totaled million before the purchase of approximately million of trading securities in  and a full year of net investment income on cash proceeds of million from the company s capital raises in october the higher interest rates prevailing during relative to for the us dollar  euro and other currencies also contributed to the increase in net investment income 
net realized investment gains decreased by million  from million in to million in although the sale of equity securities generated net realized investment gains in  net realized investment gains on equity securities were million lower than following a rise in interest rates during  the majority of the company s fixed income securities decreased in value compared to december   and the company reported net realized investment losses of million from sales of investments and other than temporary impairments  compared to net realized investment gains of million in interest in the results of equity investments increased from income of million in to income of million in  which represents the company s share of channelre holdings net income 
the decrease of million in other income in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease of million from the insurance linked securities line resulting from weather conditions in japan  partially offset by an increase of million from the principal finance line  which benefited from accelerated profit recognition on the early termination of a number of long term contracts 
other operating expenses included in corporate and other increased by million  primarily due to an increase in personnel costs  including bonus accruals  partially offset by decreases in consulting and professional fees and other costs 

table of contents interest expense increased by million in compared to due to a full year of interest on the million long term debt issued by the company in october in addition  the company incurred interest expense of million upon the redemption of its trust preferred securities in december the company also incurred interest on debt related to both its capital efficient notes issued on november  and trust preferred securities for a limited period of time prior to the trust preferred securities redemption on december  net foreign exchange losses were million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net foreign exchange losses is explained by the combined effect of the fluctuation of the us dollar against the euro and other currencies  as well as the company s hedging activities 
income tax expense increased by million  from million in to million in the increase in income tax expense is primarily a result of the increase in pre tax income and the geography or tax jurisdiction distribution of that income 
the company s taxable entities generated a higher pre tax income and tax expense in compared to in addition  the tax expense included the reduction of million in the valuation allowance in switzerland 
management concluded in that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance as a result of the positive evidence  under sfas  of the ability of the swiss operations to generate significant taxable income in despite an unprecedented level of losses in the industry 
the company also updated  in  its in depth analysis of various tax exposures and  based upon its analysis  tax reserves were reduced by million 
results by segment as a result of recent organizational changes  during the fourth quarter of  the company redefined its financial reporting segments 
segment data for the years ended december  and has been recast to conform to the current year presentation 
subsequent to the reorganization  the company monitors the performance of its underwriting operations in three segments  non life  life and corporate other 
the non life segment is further divided into four sub segments  us  global us p c  global us specialty and catastrophe 
segments and sub segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography  client types  buying patterns  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
see the description of the company s segments and sub segments as well as a discussion of how the company measures its segment results in note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
segment results are shown net of intercompany transactions 
business reported in the global non us p c and global non u 
s specialty sub segments and the life segment is  to a significant extent  denominated in foreign currencies and is reported in us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for each year 
the us dollar has fluctuated against the euro and other currencies during each of the three years presented and this should be considered when making year over year comparisons 
non life segment us the technical result of the us sub segment has fluctuated in the last three years reflecting varying levels of large loss events and development on prior years reserves  which impacted year to year comparisons as discussed below 
this sub segment includes the us casualty line  which represented approximately  and of net premiums written in this sub segment for  and  respectively 
this line typically tends to have a higher loss ratio and a lower technical result  due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
casualty treaties typically provide for investment income on premiums invested over a longer period as losses are typically paid later than for other lines 
investment income  however  is not considered in the calculation of technical result

outlook during the january  renewals  the company saw diverse market conditions 
aside from isolated increased demand and market dislocation for the agriculture business  most lines of business continued on a downward trend 
terms and conditions weakened and pricing declined in several markets as a result of increased competition and increased risk retention by cedants 
the company s book of business increased at the january  renewals in this sub segment primarily due to increased opportunities in the agriculture line 
based on overall pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects a continuation of these trends and conditions for the remainder of global non us p c the global non us p c sub segment is composed of short tail business  in the form of property and proportional motor business  that represented approximately of net premiums written for in this sub segment  and long tail business  in the form of casualty and non proportional motor business  that represented the balance of net premiums written

competitive market conditions  as well as increases in risk retention by cedants prevailed in  which reduced the opportunities for growth 
in addition to the increased risk retention by cedants  the reduction in the motor line resulted from the company s decision to non renew treaties that did not meet the company s profitability objectives

table of contents outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed a continuation of the trend by cedants to increase their retentions and reinsurers to increase their competitive behavior 
terms and conditions weakened and pricing declined in several markets as a result of the increased competition 
the increase in cedants retentions was the primary reason for the reduction of the company s book of business at the january  renewals 
however  due to the acquisition of the renewal rights of the international reinsurance business of the french monceau group in  the company was able to add a significant amount of new business to this sub segment  which partially offset the impact of increased cedant retentions 
based on overall pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects a continuation of these trends and conditions for the remainder of global non us specialty the global non us specialty sub segment is primarily comprised of lines of business that are thought to be either short or medium tail 
the short tail lines consist of agriculture  energy and specialty property and accounted for of the net premiums written in in this sub segment

table of contents there were modest shifts in the distribution of net premiums written by line and segment in  and  which reflected the company s response to existing market conditions 
additionally  the distribution of net premiums written may also be affected by the shift in treaty structure from a proportional to non proportional basis  which can significantly reduce premiums written 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all lines 
motor the decrease in both and resulted from higher risk retention by cedants  prevailing market conditions and management s decision not to renew certain treaties when the profitability did not meet the company s objectives 
life as part of its diversification strategy  the company continues to steadily increase the proportion of its life portfolio 
outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed a continuation of the trend by cedants to increase their retentions 
terms and conditions weakened and pricing declined in several markets  as a result of increased competition 
due to the acquisition of the renewal rights of the international reinsurance business of the french monceau group in  the company was able to add new business 
based on renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar trends and conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects the premium distribution by line in to be similar to premium distribution by treaty type the company typically writes business on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
on proportional business  the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant 
on non proportional business  the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio 
in both proportional and non proportional business  the company typically reinsures a large group of primary insurance contracts written by the ceding company 
in addition  the company writes a small percentage of its business on a facultative basis 
facultative arrangements are generally specific to an individual risk and can be written on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
generally  the company has more influence over pricing  as well as terms and conditions  in non proportional and facultative arrangements 
the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type for the years ended december   and was as follows non life segment proportional non proportional facultative life segment proportional non proportional total the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type is affected by changes in the allocation of capacity among lines of business  the timing of receipt by the company of cedant accounts  premium adjustments by cedants  as well as reinstatement premiums related to large catastrophic losses  which originate from non proportional treaties 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all treaty types 

table of contents the increase in the percentage of proportional gross premiums written for the life segment resulted from the increase in the company s mortality business 
the decrease in the percentage of non proportional gross premiums written for the non life segment in and compared to was mainly due to million of non proportional reinstatement premiums related to the large catastrophic losses recorded in outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type in to be similar to premium distribution by geographic region the geographic distribution of gross premiums written for the years ended december   and was as follows europe north america asia  australia and new zealand latin america  caribbean and africa total the distribution of gross premiums written by geographic region was largely comparable between periods 
the distribution of gross premiums for all non us regions was affected by foreign exchange fluctuations which increased the non us premiums in decreased in as premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated depreciated in against the us dollar were converted at higher average exchange rates in lower average exchange rates in and distorts the year to year comparisons 
in addition  management increased the allocation of capacity to areas exposed to us wind in as us wind exposed lines showed improvements in pricing and terms and conditions following the hurricanes  which resulted in growth of premiums written in north america in outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming similar conditions experienced during the january  renewals continue throughout the year  management expects the distribution of gross premiums written by geographic region in to be similar to premium distribution by production source the company generates its gross premiums written both through brokers and through direct relationships with cedants 
the percentage of gross premiums written by source for the years ended december   and was as follows broker direct the distribution of gross premiums written was comparable in and the shift from direct to broker in compared to reflected the increase of gross premiums written in north america  where premiums are written predominantly on a broker basis  and a modest shift of gross premiums written from direct to broker for the rest of the world

the following discussion includes net investment income from all investment activities  including the net investment income allocated to the life segment 
over net investment income increased in compared to due to an increase in net investment income from fixed maturities and equities primarily due to an increase in the asset base resulting from the reinvestment of cash flows from operations of  million  before the net sales of million of trading securities  in and higher reinvestment rates during  and the weakening of the us dollar  on average  in compared to contributed of the increase in net investment income  partially offset by a decrease in net investment income from short term investments  trading securities  and cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the smaller asset allocation in to cash and cash equivalents  trading securities and us government securities  a decrease in net investment income on funds held due to the effect of the commutation of a financing treaty in the company s life segment in  which resulted in a decrease of million of net investment income  and a decrease of million in net investment income reported by a cedant for a longevity treaty in compared to  and 
table of contents an increase in investment expenses resulting from the increase in the asset base 
over net investment income increased in compared to due to an increase in net investment income from fixed maturities  short term investments  trading securities  and cash and cash equivalents primarily due to an increase in the asset base resulting from the reinvestment of cash flows from operations of million  before the net purchase of approximately million of trading securities in  cash proceeds of million received from the company s capital raises in october  as well as higher interest rates in  and an increase in net investment income from equity securities primarily due to an increase in the average asset base during the year  partially offset by a decrease in allocation to equity securities during the second quarter of  partially reduced by a decrease in net investment income on funds held  as the funds held asset base at the beginning of was million lower than at the beginning of  and an increase in investment expenses resulting from the increase in the asset base 
the strengthening of the us dollar  on average  in compared to had minimal effect on the increase in net investment income 
outlook current economic indicators show a slowing of world economic growth with potential for recession in the united states 
associated lower interest rates could produce reduced reinvestment rates and reduced interest income for the company s us and european fixed maturity portfolio 
the company also expects continued weakness of the us dollar for the first half of the company expects that the larger investment asset base resulting from positive cash flows from operations including net investment income will offset the negative impact of lower rates  resulting in an expected increase in net investment income in compared to net realized investment losses gains the company s portfolio managers have dual investment objectives of optimizing current investment income and achieving capital appreciation 
to meet these objectives  it is often desirable to buy and sell securities to take advantage of changing market conditions and to reposition the investment portfolios 
accordingly  recognition of realized gains and losses is considered by the company to be a normal consequence of its ongoing investment management activities  as well as the recognition of other than temporary impairments

other than temporary impairments are recorded as realized investment losses in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income and net income per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income and net income per share  but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies and estimates other than temporary impairment of investments above  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources investments below and note f to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report

typically  the company considers impairment to have occurred when events have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its investment in the security 
the other than temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities were mainly a result of wider credit spreads 
the company also recorded other than temporary impairment charges on equity securities with large unrealized loss positions 
the company currently does not have any direct exposure to the sub prime mortgage sector in its investment portfolio  and consequently  the company s other than temporary impairment charge for did not include any write downs related to sub prime mortgage issues

table of contents net realized investment gains on trading securities  change in net unrealized investment losses gains on trading securities and net realized and unrealized investment losses on equity securities sold but not yet purchased result from the timing of disposition and the change in market value of the trading securities 
net realized and unrealized investment gains on designated hedging activities are primarily due to the comparative interest rate differential between the us dollar and the euro during each period 
net realized and unrealized gains on other invested assets were million in  compared to net realized and unrealized losses of million in and net realized and unrealized gains of million in the difference between and resulted primarily from the increase of million in net realized and unrealized gains on treasury futures recorded in compared to the difference between and resulted primarily from a decrease of million in net realized and unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments 
other realized and unrealized investment losses gains resulted primarily from the impact of foreign exchange on the sale of equity securities 
outlook following the adoption of sfas on january   the company will recognize the change in unrealized gains and losses on its fixed maturities  short term investments and equity securities in net realized investments gains and losses in its consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  with the adoption of sfas  the company will no longer be required to determine whether its investments are impaired and will not be required to record other than temporary impairment charges

channelre holdings has some direct exposure to seasoned sub prime mortgages in its reinsurance portfolio  and no direct exposure to sub prime mortgages issued after channelre holdings has also guaranteed certain cdos that include sub prime mortgage collateral 
these have high attachment points  and are considered to be well structured 
channelre holdings provides some coverages on a derivative basis rather than on an insurance basis 
the risks and obligations for channelre holdings are the same under both types of coverages 
while coverages on an insurance basis would not be affected by the volatility of the investment market  channelre holdings has to mark to market the value of the derivatives based on the current market price of the underlying security  whether or not they expect to incur a claim for losses 
over time  the mark to market losses would be reversed if credit spreads tighten or the underlying securities continue to perform as they approach maturity

however  the company 
table of contents has recorded an additional charge of million in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  to reflect the write down of its total investment in channelre holdings due to unrealized mark to market losses on channel reinsurance s credit derivative portfolio  which channel reinsurance expects to incur during the three month period ended december  and which are expected to result in channel reinsurance having negative us gaap shareholders equity at that date 
in addition to the charge related to channelre holdings in  the company recorded million of interest in earnings of equity investments related to other private placement investments and limited partnerships in which the company has more than a minor interest

the market value of investments classified as trading securities was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in trading securities is mainly due to a change in asset allocation from the equity trading portfolio to the available for sale fixed maturity portfolios during the fourth quarter of included in the total market value of trading securities at december  was million related to convertible fixed income securities and million related to equity securities 
at december   the net unrealized investment loss on trading securities was approximately million compared to a gain of million at december  other invested assets the company s other invested assets consist primarily of investments in non publicly traded companies  private placement equity investments  private placement bond investments  derivative financial instruments and other specialty asset classes 
these assets  together with the company s net liabilities for certain derivative financial instruments that were in an unrealized loss position at december   are reported within other invested assets on the company s consolidated balance sheets  and may result in substantial volatility in the company s reported net income 
as part of its principal finance transactions  the company has entered into total return and interest rate swaps  which are accounted for as derivative financial instruments 
at december  and  the notional value of the company s total return and interest rate swaps was million and million  respectively and approximately and  respectively  of the portfolio related to apparel and retail future flow or intellectual property backed transactions  with the rest distributed over a number of generally unrelated risks 
at december   approximately of the underlying investments were rated investment grade  compared to at december  the company uses internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these swaps and develops assumptions that require significant judgment  such as the timing of future cash flows  credit spreads and general level of interest rates 
as part of the insurance linked securities line  the company has entered into various weather derivatives  for which the underlying risks include parametric weather risks temperature and precipitation 
the company uses internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these derivatives and develops assumptions that require significant judgment 
at december  and  the total notional value of the company s weather derivatives was million and million  respectively 
at december   in addition to its investment in channelre holdings  the company had million in other invested assets consisting primarily of investments in non publicly traded companies  private placement equity investments  private placement bond investments and other specialty asset classes 
see corporate and other above for a discussion of the company s investment in channelre holdings 

table of contents as discussed above  the company uses exchange traded treasury note futures for the purposes of managing portfolio duration 
the notional value of the treasury futures was million at december   while the fair value of the futures contracts  recorded in other invested assets  was a net unrealized gain of million 
included in net payable for securities purchased at december  and was nil and million  respectively  of equity securities sold but not yet purchased  which represent sales of securities not owned at the time of the sale 
funds held by reinsured companies cedants the company writes certain business on a funds held basis 
as of december  and  the company recorded  million and  million  respectively  of funds held assets in its consolidated balance sheets  representing of the company s total assets 
under such contractual arrangements  the cedant retains the net funds that would have otherwise been remitted to the company and credits the net fund balance with investment income 
in general  the purpose of the funds held balances is to provide cedants with additional security that the company will honor its obligations 
the company is subject to the credit risk of the cedant in the event of insolvency or the cedant s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to the cedant for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
approximately of the funds held assets at december  earned investment income based upon a predetermined interest rate  either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized market index eg  libor 
interest rates at december  ranged from to 
under these contractual arrangements  there are no specific assets linked to the funds held balances  and the company is only exposed to the credit risk of the cedant 
with respect to the remaining of the funds held assets at december   the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant  or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire investment portfolio 
the company does not legally own or directly control the investments underlying its funds held assets and only has recourse to the cedant for the receivable balances and no claim to the underlying securities that support the balances 
decisions as to purchases and sales of assets underlying the funds held balances are made by the cedant  in some circumstances  investment guidelines regarding the minimum credit quality of the underlying assets may be agreed upon between the cedant and the company as part of the reinsurance agreement  or the company may participate in an investment oversight committee regarding the investment of the net funds  but investment decisions are not otherwise influenced by the company 
within this portion of the funds held assets  the company has several annuity treaties  which are structured so that the return on the funds held balances is tied to the performance of an underlying group of assets held by the cedant  including fluctuations in the market value of the underlying assets 
one such treaty is a retrocessional agreement under which the company receives more limited data than what is generally received under a direct reinsurance agreement 
in these arrangements  the objective of the reinsurance agreement is to provide for the covered longevity risk and to earn a net investment return on an underlying pool of assets greater than is contractually due to the annuity holders 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the cedant  the risk of loss to the company is somewhat mitigated  as the company generally has the contractual ability to offset a shortfall in the funds held asset with amounts owed to the cedant 
the company also has non life treaties in which the investment performance of the net funds held asset corresponds to the interest income on the assets held by the cedant  however  the company is not directly exposed to the underlying credit risk of these investments  as they serve only as collateral for the company s receivables 
that is  the amount owed to the company is unaffected by changes in the market value of the investments underlying the funds held 

table of contents in those cases where the company is exposed to the credit or interest rate risk of an underlying pool of assets  the company has applied the guidance of derivatives implementation group dig issue no 
b  embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments 
accordingly  the company has recognized as a realized gain or loss the value of the credit and or interest rate derivative embedded within the funds held balance 
in the case of the company s annuity contracts  there is also generally a resulting offsetting adjustment to deferred acquisition costs related to this business 
at december   the cumulative value of such embedded derivatives was determined to be a loss of approximately million  which is substantially offset by a comparable but opposite adjustment to deferred acquisition costs 
unpaid losses and loss expenses the company establishes loss reserves to cover the estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that the company writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
the company believes that the recorded unpaid losses and loss expenses represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at december  see critical accounting policies and estimates losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits above for additional information concerning losses and loss expenses

the life ratio of paid losses to net premiums earned was  and  and the life ratio of paid losses to incurred losses was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in both the life ratios for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were due to the commutation of a financing treaty in 
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of its business  the company is a party to a variety of contractual obligations as summarized below 
these contractual obligations are considered by the company when assessing its liquidity requirements  and the company is confident in its ability to meet all of its obligations

the timing and amounts of actual loss payments related to these reserves might vary significantly from the company s current estimate of the expected timing and amounts of loss payments based on many factors  including large individual losses as well as general market conditions 
policy benefits for life and annuity contracts and deposit liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  of  million and million  respectively  are computed on a discounted basis  whereas the expected payments by period in the table above are the estimated payments at a future time and do not reflect a discount of the amount payable

generally  the company seeks to increase its capital when its current capital position is not sufficient to support the volume of attractive business opportunities available 
conversely  the company will seek to reduce its capital  through dividends or stock repurchases  when available business opportunities are insufficient to fully utilize the company s capital at adequate returns 
management uses growth in diluted book value per share as a prime measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s stock price 
diluted book value per share is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common shares outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
in  the company s diluted book value per share increased by to at december  from at december  in november  partnerre finance ii inc partnerre finance ii  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued million aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate junior subordinated capital efficient notes cents

the cents are ranked as junior subordinated unsecured obligations of partnerre finance ii 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a subordinated basis all obligations of partnerre finance ii under the cents 
the company s obligations under this guarantee are unsecured and rank junior in priority of payments to the company s current long term debt 
in december  the company used a portion of the net proceeds from the cents to effect the redemption of all of the million liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities issued in by partnerre capital trust i and the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
partnerre finance ii does not meet the

accordingly  the company reflects the intercompany debt of million associated with the issuance of the cents on its consolidated balance sheets 
for purposes of discussion  the company refers to both the cents and the related debt as the cents 
subsequent to the large catastrophic loss events  the company entered into capital transactions to raise long term debt and equity 
in october  the company issued million of its common shares for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and other transaction costs 
the company used the proceeds of this capital issuance for general corporate purposes 
in addition  the company entered into a loan agreement with citibank  n

liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
management believes that its significant cash flows from operations and high quality liquid investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents were million at december  cash flows from operations in increased to  million  from million in and  million in the increase in cash flows from operations for compared to was mainly due to a change in asset allocation from trading securities  which is classified as operating cash flows under us gaap  to available for sale securities  and higher underwriting cash inflows due to lower paid losses in compared to without the impact of trading securities  net cash provided by operating activities would have been  million and million in and  respectively 
paid losses for  and included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to the large and catastrophic loss events 
the increase in cash flows from operations also reflected an increase in cash from the increase in net investment income in compared to the growth in net investment income is primarily a result of cumulative cash flows added to the portfolio 
the company is a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and other intercompany balances 
the company has cash outflows in the form of operating expenses  interest payments on its million long term debt  dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and  from time to time  cash outflows for the repurchase of its common shares under its share repurchase program 
for the year ended december   corporate expenses were million  interest paid was million  common dividends paid were million and preferred dividends paid were million 
in addition  the company paid approximately million of contract fees and interest related to its forward sale agreement in in january  the company announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend to per common share or approximately million in total for  assuming a constant number of common shares in issue and a constant dividend rate  and it will pay approximately million in dividends for preferred shareholders 
the company relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from its subsidiaries to pay the operating expenses  interest expense  shareholder dividends and other obligations of the holding company that may arise from time to time 
the company expects future dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to be the principal source of its funds to pay expenses and dividends 
although the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries to the company is limited under bermuda  french and irish laws and certain insurance statutes of various us states in which partnerre us is licensed to transact business  there are currently no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries see note to consolidated financial statements 
the reinsurance subsidiaries of the company depend upon cash inflows from the collection of premiums as well as investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments to meet their obligations 
cash outflows are in the form of claims payments  purchase of investments  operating expenses  income tax payments  intercompany payments as well as dividend payments to the holding company  and additionally  in the case of partnerre us holdings  interest payments on the long term debt and the cents 
partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries have million in third party debt as well as million of cents outstanding 
partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries paid a total of approximately million of interest on the long term debt and the cents in historically  the operating subsidiaries of the company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the company  the seasonality in the timing of payments by cedants  the irregular timing of loss payments  the impact of a change in interest rates on the investment returns as well as seasonality in coupon payment dates for fixed income securities  cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods 
the company expects that annual positive cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to cover claims payments through  absent a series of unusual catastrophic events 
in the unlikely event that paid losses accelerate beyond the ability to fund such payments from operating cash flows  the company would use its cash balances available  liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or arrange for financing 

table of contents the company and its subsidiaries have access to a revolving line of credit of up to million as part of the company s million syndicated unsecured credit facility see credit facilities below 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
financial strength ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies on the company s capacity to meet its obligations 
in the event of a significant downgrade in ratings  the company s ability to write business and to access the capital markets could be impacted 
some of the company s reinsurance treaties contain special funding and termination clauses that would be triggered in the event the company or one of its subsidiaries is downgraded by one of the major rating agencies to levels specified in the treaties  or the company s capital is significantly reduced 
if such an event were to occur  the company would be required  in certain instances  to post collateral in the form of letters of credit and or trust accounts against existing outstanding losses  if any  related to the treaty 
in a limited number of instances  the subject treaties could be cancelled retroactively or commuted by the cedant 
see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for the company s financial strength ratings 
credit facilities in the normal course of its operations  the company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured credit facilities 
these facilities are used primarily for the issuance of letters of credit  although a portion of these facilities may be used for liquidity purposes 
under the terms of certain reinsurance agreements  irrevocable letters of credit are issued on an unsecured basis in respect of cedants reported loss and unearned premium reserves 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
included in the total credit facilities available to the company at december   is a million five year syndicated  unsecured credit facility 
this credit facility enables the company to potentially increase the available credit from million to billion 
additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
the pricing grid provides the company greater flexibility and simultaneously provides participants under the facility some price protection 
as long as the company maintains a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s  the pricing on the facility will not change significantly 
the company s senior unsecured debt ratings are currently a stable and a stable by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
some of the credit facilities contain customary default  cross payment and acceleration provisions and require that the company maintain certain covenants 
the company s breach of any of the covenants would result in an event of default  upon which the company may be required to repay any outstanding borrowings and replace or cash collateralize letters of credit issued under these facilities 
the long term debt and capital securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries contain similar provisions 
these include  but are not limited to  failure to make interest and principal payments  breaches of various covenants  payment defaults or acceleration of indebtedness  certain events of bankruptcy and changes in control of the company 
at december   the company was in compliance with all required covenants  and no conditions of default existed related to the company s credit facilities or any of its debt or capital securities

settlement of the forward sale agreement may be accelerated by the forward counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events  and the maximum and minimum purchase prices will be reduced or increased quarterly depending on the amount of the company s dividends 
currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to both its ownership of partnerre sa and partnerre holdings europe limited  whose functional currencies are the euro  and to underwriting reinsurance exposures  collecting premiums and paying claims and other operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and holding certain net assets in such currencies 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposure is to the euro 
at december   the value of the us dollar weakened approximately against the british pound  against the euro  against the swiss franc  against the canadian dollar and against the japanese yen  compared to december  since a large proportion of the company s assets and liabilities are expressed in these currencies  there was a net increase in the us dollar value of the assets and liabilities denominated in these currencies in net foreign exchange losses amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview management believes that the company is principally exposed to four types of market related risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
how these risks relate to the company  and the process used to manage them  is discussed below 
as discussed previously in this report  the company s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance assets and liabilities liability funds and those assets that represent shareholder capital capital funds 
at december   liability funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition 
this procedure seeks to protect the company against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
although the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone  it is important to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the company s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of assets and liabilities in a way that is generally offsetting 
at december   capital funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
these assets represent shareholders capital and are invested in a diversified portfolio with the objective of maximizing investment return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
capital funds contain most of the asset classes typically viewed as offering a higher risk  higher return profile  such as preferred and common stocks  private equity and bond investments and convertible and high yield bonds  in addition to high quality investment grade securities 
the company s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in us dollar denominated investments 
in considering the market risk of capital funds  it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification 
although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio  market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times 
consequently  the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks 
the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative investments  subject to strict limitations 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge market risk  to enhance investment performance  to replicate investment positions or to manage market exposure and duration risks that would be allowed under the company s investment policy if implemented in other ways 
the use of financial leverage  whether achieved through derivatives or margin borrowing  requires approval from the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors 
the company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all derivative transactions 
see note k and note l to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning derivatives 
the following comments address those areas where the company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations 
interest rate risk the company s fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
the company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities 
this process involves matching the duration of the investment portfolio to the estimated duration of the liabilities 
for loss reserves and policy benefits related to non life and traditional life business  the estimated duration of the company s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns 
for policy benefits related to annuity business  the company estimates duration based on its commitment to annuitants 
the company believes that this matching process mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk reward relationship 

table of contents while this matching of duration insulates the company from the economic impact of interest rate changes  changes in interest rates do impact the reported us gaap shareholders equity of the company 
the company s liabilities are carried at their nominal value  which is not adjusted for changes in interest rates  however  the company s invested assets are carried at fair market value  which reflects such changes 
as a result  an increase in interest rates will result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investments and a corresponding decrease  net of applicable taxes  in the company s shareholders equity 
a decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
at december   the company held approximately  million of its total invested assets in mortgage asset backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
at december   the company estimates that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis point adverse parallel shift in global bond curves would result in an approximately or approximately million decrease in the fair value of investments exposed to interest rates  or an approximately and decrease of the total invested assets and shareholders equity of the company  respectively 
this change does not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the equity market  taxes or the corresponding change in the economic value of its reinsurance liabilities  which  as noted above  would substantially offset the economic impact on invested assets  although the offset would not be reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as discussed above  the company strives to match the foreign currency exposure in its fixed income portfolio to its multicurrency liabilities 
the company believes that this matching process creates a diversification benefit 
consequently  the exact market value effect of a change in interest rates will depend on which countries experience interest rate changes and the foreign currency mix of the company s fixed income portfolio at the time of the interest rate changes 
see foreign currency risk 
interest rate movements also affect the economic value of the company s outstanding debt obligations and preferred securities in the same way that they affect the company s fixed income investments  and this can result in a liability whose economic value is different from the value reported on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the economic fair value of its outstanding fixed rate debt  capital efficient notes and preferred securities at december   was as follows in millions of us dollars carrying value fair value long term debt capital efficient notes series c cumulative preferred shares series d cumulative preferred shares partnerre finance ii  the issuer of the capital efficient notes  does not meet the consolidation requirements of fin r 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million on its consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the capital efficient notes was based on the initial issuance of million from partnerre finance ii 
the fair value of the long term debt and the capital efficient notes has been calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate reflective of current market interest rates 
for the company s series c and series d cumulative preferred shares  fair value is based on quoted market prices  while carrying value is based on the liquidation value of the securities 

table of contents foreign currency risk through its multinational reinsurance operations  the company conducts business in a variety of non us currencies  with the principal exposures being the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  swiss franc and japanese yen 
as the company s reporting currency is the us dollar  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is generally able to match its liability funds against its net reinsurance liabilities both by currency and duration to protect the company against foreign exchange and interest rate risks 
however  a natural offset does not exist for all currencies 
for the non us dollar currencies for which the company deems the net asset or liability exposures to be material  the company employs a hedging strategy utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to ensure that its liability funds are matched by currency 
the company does not hedge currencies for which its asset or liability exposures are not material or where it is unable or impractical to do so 
in such cases  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material 
the company maintains capital funds primarily in us dollar investments 
to the extent that capital funds are invested in non us dollar currencies  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
this exposure is not hedged since the foreign currency risk is part of the company s total expected return on these investments 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material 
the table below summarizes the company s gross and net exposure on its december  consolidated balance sheet to foreign currency as well as the associated foreign currency derivatives the company has put in place to manage this exposure in millions of us dollars euro gbp cad chf jpy other total invested assets other net liabilities total foreign currency risk total derivative amount net foreign currency exposure as the us dollar is the company s reporting currency  there is no currency risk attached to the us dollar and it is excluded from this table 
the us dollar accounted for the difference between the company s total foreign currency risk in this table and the invested assets and other net liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the above numbers include the company s investment in partnerre sa  whose functional currency is the euro and its canadian branch  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  and partnerre holdings europe limited and its subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are the euro  which the company does not hedge  partially offset by net short or long exposures in certain currencies 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to the other currencies held by the company would result in a million change in the net assets of the company  inclusive of the effect of the derivative hedges 
credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
the company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities it purchases 

table of contents at december   approximately of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated aaa or equivalent rating  was rated a or better and of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated below investment grade 
the company believes this high quality concentration reduces its exposure to credit risk on fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
at december   the company is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk on its investments  excluding debt securities issued by the us and other aaa rated sovereign governments 
the company keeps cash and cash equivalents in several banks and may keep up to million  excluding custodial accounts  at any point in time in any one bank 
to a lesser extent  the company also has credit risk exposure as a party to foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative contracts 
to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
these contracts are generally of short duration approximately days and settle on a net basis  which means that the company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other  as opposed to the notional amount of the contracts 
at december   the company s absolute notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts was  million  while the net value of those contracts was a receivable of million 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in its underwriting operations  most notably in the credit surety line and for different alternative risk products 
loss experience in these lines of business is cyclical and is affected by the general economic environment 
the company provides its clients in these lines of business with protection against credit deterioration  defaults or other types of financial non performance of or by the underlying credits that are the subject of the protection provided and  accordingly  the company is exposed to the credit risk of those credits 
at december   the notional value of the company s credit default swaps and total return and interest rate swaps was million and million  respectively  while the fair value of those credit default swaps and total return and interest rate swaps was an unrealized loss of million and million  respectively 
as with all of the company s business  these risks are subject to rigorous underwriting and pricing standards 
in addition  the company strives to mitigate the risks associated with these credit sensitive lines of business through the use of risk management techniques such as risk diversification  careful monitoring of risk aggregations and accumulations and  at times  through the use of retrocessional reinsurance protection and the purchase of credit default swaps and total return and interest rate swaps 
the company is subject to the credit risk of its cedants in the event of their insolvency or their failure to honor the value of the funds held balances due to the company for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to cedants for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
funds held balances for which the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant or the investment return earned by the cedant on its investment portfolio are exposed to an additional layer of credit risk 
the company is also exposed to some extent to the underlying financial market risk of the pool of assets  inasmuch as the underlying policies may have guaranteed minimum returns 
the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its business written through brokers if any of the company s brokers is unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to payments to the company 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  if the broker fails to make payments to the insured under the company s policy  the company might remain liable to the insured for the deficiency 
see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for detailed information on two brokers that accounted for more than of the company s gross premiums written for the year ended december  the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses 
reinsurance balances receivable from the company s clients at december  were  million  including balances both currently due and accrued 
the company believes that credit risk related to these balances is mitigated by several factors  including but not limited to  
table of contents credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances 
in addition  as the vast majority of its reinsurance agreements permit the company the right to offset reinsurance balances receivable from clients against losses payable to them  the company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance balances receivable was million at december  although the company does not rely heavily on retrocessional reinsurance  it does require its reinsurers to have adequate financial strength 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
the balance of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses was million which is net of the allowance provided for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables of million at december  equity price risk the company invests a portion of its capital funds in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale fair market value of million at december  
the company also holds marketable equity securities classified as trading securities fair market value of million at december  
these equity investments are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
the company believes that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of its investments in equities relative to total investments mitigate its exposure to equity price risk 
the company estimates that its equity investment portfolio has a beta versus the s p index of approximately portfolio beta measures the response of a portfolio s performance relative to a market return  where a beta of would be an equivalent return to the index 
given the estimated beta for the company s equity portfolio  a movement in the s p index would result in an approximately or approximately million increase or decrease in the market value of the company s equity portfolio  or an approximately and increase or decrease of the total invested assets and shareholders equity of the company  respectively 
this change does not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the bond market or taxes
