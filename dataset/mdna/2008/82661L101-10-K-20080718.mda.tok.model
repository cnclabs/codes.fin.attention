words such as continue  anticipate  will  expect  believe  plan  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on the current expectations of sigmatron including its subsidiaries 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  the company s plans  actions and actual results could differ materially 
such statements should be evaluated in the context of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the company s business including the company s continued dependence on certain significant customers  the continued market acceptance of products and services offered by the company and its customers  pricing pressures from our customers  suppliers and the market  the activities of competitors  some of which may have greater financial or

these and other factors which may affect the company s future business and results of operations are identified throughout the company s annual report on form k and as risk factors and may be detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these statements speak as of the date of this report  and the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements in light of future events or otherwise 
overview the company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of ems  which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled box build electronic products 
in connection with the production of assembled products  the company also provides services to its customers  including automatic and manual assembly and testing of products  material sourcing and procurement  design  manufacturing and test engineering support  warehousing and shipment services  and assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies 
the company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the united states  mexico  china and taiwan 
the company relies on numerous third party suppliers for components used in the company s production process 
certain of these components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  a customer s specifications may require the company to obtain components from a single source or a small number of suppliers 
the loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  and the company may be required to operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from suppliers 
the company does not enter into purchase agreements with major or single source suppliers 
the company believes that ad hoc negotiations with its suppliers provides flexibility  given that the company s orders are based on the needs of its customers  which constantly change 
pricing for components and commodities has escalated significantly and may continue to increase in the future periods 
the impact of these price increases could have a negative effect on the company s gross margins and operating results 
the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and listing requirements subsequently adopted by nasdaq in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these rules  regulations  and requirements have increased the company s legal expenses  financial compliance and administrative costs  made many other activities more time consuming and costly and diverted the attention of senior management 
these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
in addition  if the company receives a qualified opinion on the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting  shareholders and the company s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the company s financial statements 
this could have a material adverse impact on the value of the company s stock and the company s liquidity 
sales can be a misleading indicator of the company s financial performance 
sales levels can vary considerably among customers and products depending on the type of services consignment and turnkey rendered by the company and the demand by customers 
consignment orders require the company to perform manufacturing services on components and other materials supplied by a customer  and the company charges only for its labor  overhead and manufacturing costs  plus a profit 
in the case of turnkey orders  the company provides  in addition to manufacturing services  the components and other materials used in assembly 
turnkey contracts  in general  have a higher dollar volume of sales for each given assembly  owing to inclusion of the cost of components and other materials in net sales and cost of goods sold 
variations in the number of turnkey 
table of contents orders compared to consignment orders can lead to significant fluctuations in the company s revenue levels 
however  the company does not believe that such variations are a meaningful indicator of the company s gross margins 
consignment orders accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the year ended april  in the past  the timing and rescheduling of orders have caused the company to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in its revenues and earnings  and the company expects such fluctuations to continue 
critical accounting policies management estimates and uncertainties the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include depreciation and amortization periods  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory and valuation of goodwill 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of the company s electronic manufacturing services business are recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
in general  it is the company s policy to recognize revenue and related costs when the order has been shipped from our facilities  which is also the same point that title passes under the terms of the purchase order except for consignment inventory 
consignment inventory is shipped from the company to an independent warehouse for storage or shipped directly to the customer and stored in a segregated part of the customer s own facility 
upon the customer s request for inventory  the consignment inventory is shipped to the customer if the inventory was stored offsite or transferred from the segregated part of the customer s facility for consumption  or use  by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue upon such transfer 
the company does not earn a fee for storing the consignment inventory 
the company generally provides a ninety day warranty for workmanship only and does not have any installation  acceptance or sales incentives  although the company has negotiated longer warranty terms in certain instances 
the company assembles and tests assemblies based on customers specifications 
historically  the amount of returns for workmanship issues has been de minimis under the company s standard or extended warranties 
any returns for workmanship issues received after each period end are accrued in the respective financial statements 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company establishes inventory reserves for valuation  shrinkage  and excess and obsolete inventory 
the company records provisions for inventory shrinkage based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect the company s inventories and cost of products sold 
the company records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories for the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
actual product demand or market conditions could be different than that projected by management 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
the company has adopted sfas no 
 which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
goodwill and other intangibles the company adopted on june   sfas no 
business combinations 
under sfas no 
 a purchaser must allocate the total consideration paid in a business combination to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets based on their fair value 
goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the company to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible 
table of contents impairment 
the company adopted sfas effective january  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed its annual assessment of impairment regarding the goodwill recorded 
the company calculates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and certain market approaches which considered both the company s market capitalization and trading multiples of comparable companies 
the calculations of fair value of the reporting unit involve significant judgment and different underlying assumptions could result in different calculated fair values 
the goodwill impairment analysis indicated there was no goodwill impairment for the year ended april  as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 
in january  the company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test under sfas from the last day of the year to the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter 
the impairment test procedures were carried out during the fourth quarter and up to the time of the filing of the company s form k  which allowed the company additional time to complete the required analysis under sfas the company believes that the resulting change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date did not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
the company determined that the change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date was preferable under the circumstances and did not result in adjustments to the company s financial statements when applied retrospectively 
during the fiscal year  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing and the carrying value of the company s reporting unit exceeded the fair value indicating a goodwill impairment 
the company completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test used to measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
as a result of this impairment analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended april  the impairment is due to continuing customer pricing pressures and uncertain economic conditions as well as the company s declining stock price during fiscal new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments sfas 
sfas allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
this statement is effective for all financials instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  that clarifies the accounting and recognition for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the company s tax returns 
the company adopted fin on may   and recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by recording an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions of  that was accounted for as a debit to opening retained earnings 
uncertain tax position reserves of  were reversed during fiscal the entire amount of the consolidated worldwide liability for uncertain tax positions could affect the company s effective tax rate upon favorable resolution of the uncertain tax positions 
absent new experience in defending these uncertain tax positions in the various jurisdictions to which they relate  the company cannot currently estimate a range of possible change of the april  liability over the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest and penalties  is as follows balance at may  additions based on tax positions related to current year additions for tax positions in prior year reductions for tax positions of prior year balance at april

in november  the fasb agreed to a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas may have on its financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value options for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings
