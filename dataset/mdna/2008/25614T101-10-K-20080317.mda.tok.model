during the year ended december   the company experienced an increase in its adjusted ebitda loss as increases in its revenue and gross profit did not offset greater increases in its core operating expenses core operating expenses are general and administrative compensation  professional fees  sales and marketing  other and research and development costs 
the company s core operating expenses from continuing operations increased from during  the company saw expenses increases due to an increase in its production facilities and capabilities  significant expenses associated with the company s sarbanes oxley compliance requirements  and a significant increase in spending for marketing and sales efforts 
it is the company s belief that the amounts it is incurring during the current periods for sales and marketing are investments that will drive future revenue to adjusted ebitda break even levels 
however  the company cannot be certain that it will be able to successfully obtain these break even levels which would require the company to significantly reduce its costs structure 
adjusted ebitda vs while net loss increased in as compared to  adjusted ebitda deficit increased only between the same periods 
these results reflect that the increases in revenue and resulting gross profits during the year ended december  significantly outpaced increases in the company s core operating expenses core operating expenses are compensation  professional fees  sales and marketing  other and research and development costs  which increased during the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows and other key indicators of liquidity are summarized as follows year ended december change vs 
year ended december  change vs 
cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities investing activities financing activities working capital a current ratio a x x x as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  representing an decrease over our december  cash position 
as discussed below  the decrease in the company s cash position was primarily due to the use of cash from operations and the use of cash for the expansion of its operations and the defense of its patent portfolio 
operating cash flow during  the company used approximately million of cash for operations 
as discussed above  the increase in revenue that the company achieved during was offset by increases in the company s core expenditures  primarily sales and marketing  production facility expansion and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
as of december   the company believes that it will need to reach an annual revenue level of approximately million based on its current expense levels and its projected mix of revenue in order to maintain positive operating cash flow 
during  the company s used million of cash for operations during the year despite reporting a million net loss 
this differential primarily reflects the significance of non cash expenditures and deferred revenue on its operating results 
specifically  the company recorded million in depreciation and amortization expense and million in stock based compensation expense during the  which combined totaled of the reported net loss but do not represent cash expenses to the company in furthermore  the company received approximately million in pre payments from customers for licenses and services for which revenue recognition is deferred over the license period or service period 
the receipt of this cash significantly reduced the use of cash for operations for the company during  especially during the latter half of the year 
as a result  the company s cash flow from operations improved in as compared to despite an increase in net loss of between the same periods 
investing cash flow during  the company used approximately million of cash for fixed asset additions and to invest in its patent portfolio 
during the second quarter of  the company initiated a move into new production facility for its san francisco area plastic printing division 
the company began to move into the new facility in november during  the company incurred approximately  in leasehold improvements associated with the new facility and purchased approximately  in new equipment  of which  was financed by capital leases 
along with increasing the space of the division five fold  the company s new equipment  including a state of the art laminator and a digital plate system  are expected to significantly increase the output capacity of its operations

the company expects that these strategic uses of cash will result in future positive cash flows resulting from its ability to maintain and grow its manufacturing capabilities at its p facility  and from potential legal settlements of other arrangements resulting from its investments in its patent portfolio and the defense of its patents 
furthermore  as displayed below  the company has been able to use its equity to offset its use of cash for the investments that it deems important for the continued long term growth potential of the company 
cash paid for interest non cash investing and financing activities equity issued for patent defense costs modificaton of equity awards for license agreement equity issued for acquisition equity issued for prepaid services equity issued for other intangible assets equipment purchased via capital lease deferred tax liability offsetting additional paid in capital financing cash flows during the first quarter of  the company received approximately  from the private placement of stock and the exercise of warrants which was offset by the payment of approximately  in fees associated with the private placements concluded in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in addition  the company received approximately  in capital lease financing during used to expand its p operations and the company borrowed  from its ceo  under the terms of a credit facility agreement as discussed below 
cash flows from discontinued operations during the nine months ended september   the company s retail printing and copying division used approximately  of cash for operations 
in addition  during this period  the division did not have any investing or financing cash flow activities 
cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and future capital needs the company expects to use its working capital to support its growth efforts in order to achieve consistent positive cash flow from operations 
at its current revenue levels  the company expects to continue to use cash for operations during at the pace experienced in the company estimates that it requires a revenue level of approximately million  or greater than the revenue achieved in  to achieve consistent positive operating cash flows 
the company believes that it will achieve this revenue level by the end of based on this expectation  the company has committed to focus its expenditures during on areas of research and development  and sales and marketing that support near term revenue opportunities 
in addition  the company regularly reviews business conditions to gauge whether changes to its expense levels are warranted 
the company s near term cash requirements also include legal costs and fees associated with the defense of its patents that are incurred by law firms  experts and consultants that are not covered under the share payment arrangement that the company entered into with its lead counsel on the suit 
these costs will be incurred as the company contends against patent validity suits in nine countries patent courts as part of the european central bank s countersuit strategy in the patent infringement case 
see item legal proceedings 
the cumulative cash requirements for these cases  which are in various stages  could be as much as  in if the company is successful in the defense of its patents or in its litigation against the ecb  the company believes that it will be able to recover a portion of these litigation costs along with legal fees paid to its lead counsel in common stock 
if the company is not successful in its litigation against the ecb  the company will likely be required to pay a significant portion of the ecb s legal costs as well 
the company estimates that these costs could be substantial and the payment of these amounts could adversely affect the company s financial position 
to address these cash requirements  the company secured credit financing that if feels will meet its cash requirements for at least the next months 
on january   the company entered into a credit facility agreement with fagenson and co  inc  as agent  a related party to robert b 
fagenson  the chairman of the company s board of directors

any amount borrowed by the company pursuant to the fagenson credit agreement will have an annual interest rate of above libor and will be secured by the common stock of plastic printing professionals  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears and the principal is payable in full at the end of the term under the fagenson credit agreement 
in addition  on january   the company also entered into a credit facility agreement with patrick white  the company s chief executive officer 
under the white credit agreement  the company can borrow up to  from time to time up to and until january  any amount borrowed by the company pursuant to the white credit agreement will have an annual interest rate of above libor and will be secured by the accounts receivable of the company  excluding the accounts receivable of p interest is payable quarterly in arrears and the principal is payable in full at the end of the term under the white credit agreement 
mr 
white can accept common stock as payment upon default 
under the terms of the agreements  the company is required to comply with various covenants 
during the year ended december   patrick white advanced the company  while the terms of the credit facility agreement were being finalized 
future commitments for lease and debt agreements as of december  is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years revolving notes capital leases operating leases key indicators of future results we believe that cash flow from operations is a significant key indicator for the company 
our ability to reduce our use of cash will depend on our ability to grow revenue to a level sufficient to meet our operating expense requirements 
to grow revenue  we may merge with or acquire manufacturing or related companies 
our ability to successfully complete these transactions on favorable terms will be a significant key indicator of our future results 
these acquisitions may require additional funds that the company does not currently have 
to obtain additional investments in the future may require us to issue shares of our common stock 
our ability to sell our common stock on favorable terms will also be a significant key indicator of our future results 
in addition  we believe that our ability to successfully enforce our patent rights  including our current litigation against the european central bank  is a significant key indicator for the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  and the valuation of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill impairments goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but are combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
under the criteria set forth by sfas no 
 the company has three reporting units based on the current structure 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and performs annual assessments 
in making its assessment  management must make estimates of its future cash flows from operations and those estimates could deviate both favorably and unfavorably from actual results 
in addition  in arriving at the reporting units fair market value  management must makes estimates of discount rates to apply to the future cash flows based on rates of return associated with the underlying risk with those cash flows 
these estimates may be different for what could be achieved in the market place 
long lived assets and intangible assets the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generate by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
in making its assessment  management must make estimates of its future cash flows from operations and those estimates could deviate both favorably and unfavorably from actual results 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimate useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset

income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis an valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has elected to record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we held  in cash 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately  for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents
