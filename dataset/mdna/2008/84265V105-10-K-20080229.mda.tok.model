item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to and should be read together with our audited consolidated combined financial statements as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  effective april   southern copper corporation acquired substantially all of the outstanding common stock of minera mexico 
the acquisition was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests as it involved the reorganization of entities under common control 
under such accounting  the financial statements of scc and minera mexico are combined on a historical cost basis for all the periods presented since they were under the indirect common control of grupo mexico during such periods 
therefore  unless otherwise noted  the discussion below of our financial condition and results of operations is for us  including our minera mexico subsidiary  on a consolidated or combined basis for all periods 
our combined financial results may not be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition of minera mexico taken place at the beginning of the periods presented and do not purport to be indicative of our future results 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
see cautionary statements 
overview our business is primarily the production and sale of copper 
in the process of producing copper  a number of valuable metallurgical by products are recovered  such as molybdenum  zinc  silver  lead and gold  which we also produce and sell 
market forces outside of our control largely determine the sales prices for our products 
our management  therefore  focuses on copper production  cost control  production enhancement and maintaining a prudent capital structure to improve profitability 
we believe we achieve these goals through capital spending programs  exploration efforts and cost reduction programs 
our aim is to remain profitable during periods of low copper prices and to maximize financial performance in periods of high copper prices 
a number of events and results highlight our company s year 
net sales were  million an increase over  additionally  net earnings were  million  an increase of over  both sales and net earnings are the highest in the company history 
these increases were achieved while three of our mexican properties  cananea  san martin and taxco  were on strike from july through the end of the year 
we estimate that these strikes cost the company million pounds of copper and million pounds of zinc  and reduced operating income by million 
since january  the cananea mine is open and is preparing to gradually resume normal operations in the near future 
the mine was reopened based on a ruling by the labor authorities who declared the strike illegal 
subsequently  the cananea union obtained an injunction from a federal judge preventing the company from firing workers who do not return to work immediately  the same judge did explicitly safeguard the rights of any worker who wished to return to work at the mine and the right of the company to conduct operations in the ordinary course of business 
the ruling declaring the illegality of the cananea strike was challenged before a federal judge who upheld the union s case on february  the company will appeal this unfavorable ruling 
the company expects that it will take about three months to return to full production at cananea 
earnings and sales in increased because of higher average metal prices for most of our products  copper was to higher in  depending on whether it was priced on the comex or lme market  the molybdenum price was higher and silver was higher 
of our other significant by products only zinc prices were lower in and  in that case  by 
the cananea strike resulted in a decrease in copper  zinc and silver sales volumes 
however  during this year there was an increase in the volume of molybdenum sales 
molybdenum production and sales volume increased in due to higher grades at our peruvian mines and from an increase in production from the la caridad mine  which suffered strike losses in another factor effecting the improvement in sales and net income was the impact of the derivative metal contracts which reduced net sales and operating income in by million and increased net sales and operating income by million in during we announced a modification to our capital investment program to prioritize major investments in peru 
these investments include the tia maria sx ew copper project in arequipa  peru  expansions of the toquepala and cuajone concentrators and the expansion of the smelter and refinery in ilo  peru 
we estimate that these investments will have a capital cost of  million and increase our annual copper production by  tons in feasibility studies indicate a resource of million tons of mineralized material at tia maria with an average copper grade of 
we discuss below several matters that our management believes are important to understand our results of operations and financial condition 
these matters include i our operating cash costs as a measure of our performance  ii metals prices  iii our acquisition of minera mexico  iv our business segments and v the effects of inflation and other local currency issues 
since our inception  we have principally maintained operations in peru 
however  in recent years  we have refocused our strategies to internationalize our business and broaden our market exposure 
in  we acquired exploration properties in chile  which are being evaluated for potential exploitation and in we acquired minera mexico  with substantial mining operation in mexico 
please see minera mexico acquisition 
operating cash costs an overall benchmark used by us and a common industry metric to measure performance is operating cash costs per pound of copper produced 
operating cash cost is a non gaap measure that does not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies 
a reconciliation of our operating cash cost per pound to the cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion as presented in the consolidated combined statement of earnings is presented under the subheading  non gaap information reconciliation  below 
we have defined operating cash cost per pound as cost of sales including depreciation  amortization and depletion  plus selling  general and administrative charges  treatment and refining charges  less by products revenue and sales premiums  depreciation  amortization and depletion  workers participation and other miscellaneous charges  including the peruvian royalty charge and the change in inventory levels  divided by total pounds of copper produced and purchased by us 
in our calculation of operating cash cost per pound of copper produced  we credit against our costs the revenues from the sale of by products  principally molybdenum  zinc and silver and the premium over market price that we receive on copper sales 
we account for the by product revenue in this way because we consider our principal business to be the production and sale of copper 
we believe that our company is viewed by the investment community as a copper company  and is valued  in large part  by the investment community s view of the copper market and our ability to produce copper at a reasonable cost 
we also include copper sales premiums as a credit  as these amounts are in excess of published copper prices 
the increase in recent years in the price of molybdenum  as well as increases in silver and zinc  has had a significant effect on our traditional calculation of cash cost and its comparability between periods 
accordingly  we present cash costs with and without crediting the by product revenues against our costs 
we exclude from our calculation of operating cash cost depreciation  amortization and depletion  which are considered non cash expenses 
exploration is considered a discretionary expenditure and is also excluded 
workers participation provisions are determined on the basis of pre tax earnings and are also excluded 
additionally excluded from operating cash costs are items of a non recurring nature  the royalty charge and in periods prior to the portion of our mine stripping costs that we capitalized 
our operating cash costs per pound  as defined  are presented in the table below for the three years ended december  we present cash costs with and without the inclusion of by product revenues 
dollars per pound operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased operating cash cost per pound of copper produced and purchased without by product revenue the decrease in the cash costs per pound of copper produced and purchased including by product revenue in is mainly attributable to higher market price and volume of molybdenum in the credit for molybdenum sales amounted to per pound  per pound and per pound  in  and  respectively 
the credit to the cost for zinc sales amounted to per pound  per pound and per pound in  and  respectively 
the credit to operating cash cost for the by product revenue in reduced cash cost by per pound  an increase in benefit of per pound over the improved benefit is almost entirely due to molybdenum revenue  which accounted for per pound of the improvement 
the reason for the added benefit from molybdenum revenues in is attributable to both higher sales volume and higher sales price 
volumes improved because of better grades at our peruvian mines and higher production  an increase of million pounds from la caridad in mexico  which had significant strike activity in molybdenum prices were higher in the credit to operating cash cost in improved over by per pound and was principally caused by improvements in the sales price of zinc and silver  reduced somewhat by a decrease in the sales price of molybdenum 
the cash cost without by product revenue increased in principally as a result of the following factors  higher production cost mainly power  water  labor and repair costs which increased our cash cost by  higher freight and treatment charges due to the sale of concentrates which increased cost by and also an increase of in unit cost due to strikes at some of our mexican operations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the purchase of outside metal  which reduced cost by 
the cash cost without by product revenue increased in as a result of cost increases 
the increasingly higher copper prices in increased our computation of cash cost  as we include in our calculation the cost of purchased metal 
the higher value and thus the higher cost of copper in increased our cash cost by in significant strike activity at some of our mexican properties required us to purchase larger quantities of third party copper in also the cost of fuel products  electricity and other supplies increased in additionally  our operating cash costs increased in as a result of the eitf consensus  which we adopted on january  and is described below under critical accounting policies and estimates capitalized mine stripping costs 
if we had applied this consensus in our per pound operating cash cost would have increased by 
metals prices the profitability of our operations is dependent on  and our financial performance is significantly affected by  the international market prices for the products we produce  especially for copper  molybdenum  zinc and silver 
metals prices historically have been subject to wide fluctuations and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors  which affect each commodity to varying degrees  include international economic and political conditions  levels of supply and demand  the availability and cost of substitutes  inventory levels maintained by producers and others and  to a lesser degree  inventory carrying costs and currency exchange rates 
in addition  the market prices of certain metals have on occasion been subject to rapid short term changes due to speculative activities 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metals prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged and giving no effects to potential hedging programs  metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions minera mexico acquisition in april   we acquired minera mexico from a subsidiary of grupo mexico  our controlling stockholder 
at the time of the acquisition minera mexico was the largest mining company in mexico and the eleventh largest copper producer in the world on a stand alone basis 
we exchanged million newly issued shares of our common stock for the outstanding shares of minera mexico s direct majority stockholder  and minera mexico became our owned subsidiary 
as a part of this transaction  on march   we paid a special transaction dividend of million to all of our stockholders 
upon completion of the merger  grupo mexico increased its indirect beneficial ownership of our capital stock from approximately to approximately 
in october  in another transaction we acquired million shares of minera mexico from grupo mexico for million 
this increased our holdings in minera mexico to 
with this acquisition  based on the then current data  we increased our total copper reserves by over and increased our annual copper production by approximately 
business segments company management views southern copper as having three operating segments and manages on the basis of these segments 
the significant increase in the price of molybdenum over the past three years has had an important impact on the company s earnings 
nevertheless  the company continues to manage its operations on the basis of three copper segments 
these segments are our peruvian operations  our mexican open pit operations and our mexican underground operations  known as our immsa unit 
our peruvian operations include the toquepala and cuajone mine complexes and the smelting and refining plants  industrial railroad and port facilities which service both mines 
our mexican open pit operations include la caridad and cananea mine complexes  the smelting and refining plants and support facilities which service both mines 
our immsa unit includes five underground mines that produce zinc  lead  copper  silver and gold  a coal mine  and several industrial processing facilities for zinc  copper and silver 
segment information is included in our review of results of operations and also in note of our consolidated combined financial statements 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian nuevo sol and the mexican peso our functional currency is the us dollar 
portions of our operating costs are denominated in peruvian nuevos soles and mexican pesos 
since our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation deflation in peru or mexico is not offset by a change in the exchange rate of the nuevo sol or the peso  respectively  to the dollar  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected to the extent that the inflation devaluation effects are passed onto us by our suppliers or reflected in our wage adjustments 
in addition  the dollar value of our net monetary assets denominated in nuevos soles or pesos can be affected by devaluation of the nuevo sol or the peso  resulting in a remeasurement loss in our financial statements 
recent inflation and devaluation rates are provided in the table below 
year ended december  peru peruvian inflation rate nuevo sol dollar appreciation devaluation rate mexico mexican inflation rate peso dollar appreciation devaluation rate capital expansion program we made capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we expect to make capital expenditures  of approximately million in in general  the capital expenditures and projects described below are intended to contribute to further vertical integration of our operations by increasing the capacity for production of refined metal products 
the company expects to meet the cash requirements for these projects from cash on hand  internally generated funds and from additional external financing if required 
the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in millions projects ilo smelter modernization cuajone ball mill toquepala crushing  conveying system for leach material toquepala copper filter tailings disposal quebrada honda dam cuajone leaching pad pls dams at huanuquera la francisca leaching dam la caridad tailings dam internal dikes metallurgical laboratory la caridad la caridad gas handling system la caridad acid plant upgrade la caridad vertical lime kiln pls dams and leaching system cananea cananea sx ew plant iii cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material phases ii and iii nueva rosita coke furnaces san martin underground shaft la caridad tailings dam growth concentrator santa barbara segovedad ii mine expansion and conveyor and main substation total project expenditures replacement capital expenditures mexico peru total replacement expenditures total capital expenditures set forth below are descriptions of some of our current projects and expected capital expenditures 
ilo smelter modernization this project was completed in january and has allowed our company to increase sulfur capture over the requirement established in our agreement with the peruvian government 
the new smelter maintains production at current levels 
the nominal and design capacity for the new isasmelt furnace was reached in less than days  compared with other smelting furnaces using this technology  the start up of the ilo smelter was achieved in the shortest time 
the average sulfur capture in was 
performance tests are pending completion with the two major contractors 
these are expected to be completed in the first quarter the facility is currently operating at full capacity and we expect to smelt million tons of concentrates in the total cost of this project was million 
toquepala leach dump project this project at toquepala  which includes a crushing  conveying and spreading system at the leach dumps  was completed by year end the conveying system is operating and has positioned million tons of waste material to build the ramp and has placed million tons of leachable material 
total expended on this project through december  was million and it is estimated that million will be needed to finalize this project 
cananea sx ew plant this project is intended to increase cananea s production of copper cathodes with a new sx ew plant  sx ew iii with an annual capacity of  tons 
the plant would produce copper cathodes of astm grade or lme grade a 
the project includes the installation of storage for deliverables required for operation of the plant and the installation of an emergency power plant and a fire protection system 
due to labor problem at cananea in  this project has been temporarily put on hold until we satisfactorily resolve these issues 
gas handling system this project is intended to improve gas capture efficiency and reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions to the atmosphere by the converters and reactor at la caridad copper smelter 
cananea crusher and conveyors system for leach material this project includes the installation of a crushing system and bands for leach material including a movable stacker with a capacity of million tons of crushing material 
we are currently in the third phase of the project 
this phase includes  meters of band transporters and the construction of a meters tunnel to move the material to the leaching area 
other expenditures tailings disposal at quebrada honda this project will increase the height of the existing quebrada honda dam to impound future tailings from the toquepala and cuajone mills 
the procurement of the main equipment  with long fabrication lead time continues and part of the material has been received 
construction of the main civil works and some access roads for the main and lateral dams has been completed and our operations personnel are working on an additional access road 
the first stage of this project will be under development until the total cost of this project is estimated to be million  with million expended through december  the dam project at huanaquera includes the construction of sedimentation  pls and storm water retention dams for the toquepala leaching facility 
the project is at the administrative close out stage  all equipment was installed and is operative 
total spending on this project through december  was million and it is estimated that million will be needed to complete the project 
a pre feasibility study for los chancas  a copper molybdenum property in the southern part of peru was completed and is being evaluated in order to determine our next steps for this project 
also  we are in the process of formulating the necessary program and timeframe to develop our mexican properties at el arco in baja california and angangueo in michoacan 
potential projects we have a number of projects that we may develop in the future 
we evaluate new projects on the basis of our long term corporate objectives  expected return  environmental needs  required investment and estimated production  among other considerations 
we have defined three generations of capital projects first generation projects that we are planning 
this generation includes the development of five projects in peru the tia maria sx ew copper project  the toquepala concentrator expansion  the cuajone concentrator expansion  the ilo smelter expansion  and the ilo copper refinery expansion  with a total investment of  million 
this investment would permit us to increase our copper production by  tons per year by  which represents of the current production level 
this new investment program replaces the investment program previously approved for our mexican operations  which included a sx ew iii plant  concentrator expansion and molybdenum circuit at cananea  the buena vista mine  the new cananea concentrator  and the guaymas smelter and refinery 
these projects with a total investment of  million have been temporarily put on hold 
feasibility studies for the tia maria project were finished with indicative resources of million tons of mineralized material with an average copper grade of 
the company is conducting a bidding process for basic and detailed engineering as well as preparing to purchase major equipment and select construction management 
the company expects to invest million in this project during when completed at the end of  the new operating unit will produce  tons of copper cathodes per year 
second generation projects that are attractive but will require significant additional evaluation 
this generation includes three greenfield projects el arco  angangueo and los chancas exploration properties 
we believe that these properties could add  tons of annual copper production  in concentrate and sx ew copper 
the company s board of directors will be evaluating the investment in these projects in line with their expected returns  the metal market price performance and the operating and capital costs 
third generation this generation includes the cananea  sonora and guaymas projects put on hold by our board of directors as result of the strikes in at some of our mexican units the cananea sx ew iii  the cananea concentrator expansion  the cananea molybdenum circuit  the buena vista mine  the new cananea concentrator  and the guaymas smelter and refinery 
the above information about potential projects are estimates only 
we cannot make any assurance that we will undertake any of these projects or that the information noted is accurate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon our consolidated combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these consolidated combined financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared 
changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate  which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management 
areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include ore reserves  revenue recognition  estimated mine stripping ratios  leachable material and related amortization  the estimated useful lives of fixed assets  asset retirement obligations  litigation and contingencies  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  tax positions  fair value of financial instruments  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
ore reserves for purposes of our long term planning  we use metal price assumptions of per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum 
prior to  we used per pound and per pound for copper and molybdenum  respectively 
metal prices over the last ten years and the continued positive outlook for these metals have led us to reappraise our view of prices 
these prices are intended to approximate average prices over the long term 
ore reserves based on these prices are the basis for our internal planning  including the preparation of the mine plans for our mines 
our management uses these price assumptions  as it believes these prices reflect the full price cycle of the metals market 
however  pursuant to sec guidance  the reserves information in this report is calculated using average metals prices over the most recent three years  except as otherwise stated 
we refer to these three year average metals prices as current average prices 
our current average prices for copper are calculated using prices quoted by comex  and our current average prices for molybdenum are calculated according to platt s metals week 
unless otherwise stated  reserves estimates in this report use per pound for copper and per pound for molybdenum  both current average prices as of december  the current average per pound prices for copper and molybdenum were and  respectively  as of december  and and  respectively  as of december  certain financial information is based on reserve estimates calculated on the basis of current average prices 
this includes amortization of intangible assets and mine development  and for years prior to the amount of mine stripping that was capitalized and units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping 
leachable material at one of our mexican mines  we capitalize the cost of materials with low copper content extracted during the mining process leachable material  which is collected in leach dumps 
the amortization of the capitalized cost is determined based on the depletion period of the leach dumps  which is estimated to be five years 
if we were to have expensed all capitalized leaching costs associated with this mining operation as incurred  net operating cost would have decreased by million for the year and increased million and million for the years  and asset retirement obligation our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
these estimates are based in part on our inflation and credit rate assumptions 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work required to be performed by us 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 
we further discuss our asset retirement obligation in note to our consolidated combined financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition for certain of our sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the molybdenum oxide proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case for sales of molybdenum products  generally ranging between one and three months subsequent to shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment 
the provisionally priced copper sales are adjusted to reflect forward copper prices based on lme or comex prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
in the case of molybdenum sales  for which there are no published forward prices  the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect the market prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
deferred taxes in preparing our consolidated combined financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rate is recognized through the income tax provision in the period that the change is enacted 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
asset impairments we evaluate our long term assets when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
our evaluations are based on business plans that are prepared using a time horizon that is reflective of our expectations of metal prices over our business cycle 
we are currently using a long term average copper price of per pound of copper and an average molybdenum price of per pound  along with near term price forecast  for through  reflective of the current price environment  for our impairment tests 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or asset group over the remaining life to measure whether the assets are recoverable and measure any impairment by reference to fair value 
should estimates of future copper and molybdenum prices decrease significantly  impairments could result 
provisionally priced sales the following are the provisionally priced copper and molybdenum sales outstanding at december   and year ended december  provisionally priced sales copper millions of pounds priced at per pound molybdenum millions of pounds priced at per pound provisional sales adjustments included in accounts receivable and net sales at december   and were as follows year ended december  provisional sales adjustments dollars in millions copper molybdenum total during the month of january  the market price of copper and molybdenum increased 
the effect of these changes on sales settling in january was an increase of million in sales 
additionally  forward prices for copper as of january  also increased  the effect of this increase on open sales settling after january would be an increase of million in sales

this practice was discontinued in and immsa s zinc sales were either to their customers or to the peruvian segment  who in turn resold to their customers 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales our sales in were  million  compared with  million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was attributable to higher market prices for most of our products 
copper was to higher in  depending on whether it was comex or lme market  the molybdenum price was higher and silver was higher 
zinc prices decreased by in in addition  molybdenum sales volume increased in due to higher grades at our peruvian mines and increased production from the la caridad mine which had strike losses in net sales also include a million gain on copper derivatives compared with a loss of million in there was  however  a decrease in copper sales volume in due to a strike at the cananea mine 
sales volume for copper decreased by million pounds in a decrease of compared with the impact of this decrease in copper sales volume  as well as a volume decrease in the sale of zinc and silver was a result of the strikes at some of our mexican operations 
however  during this year there was an increase in the volume of molybdenum sales 
the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products 
year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister anode concentrates sx ew rod total mine copper production was  million pounds in  a decrease of from this decrease of million pounds included a reduction of million pounds at our mexican operations due to strike related reductions at our cananea and san martin mines where strikes began on july  and ran through the end of the year 
additionally  production at our peruvian mines decreased by million pounds mainly due to lower ore grade at the toquepala mine 
the make up of our copper sales changed significantly from  as we sold about million additional pounds of copper in concentrate form and about million pounds less of refined copper 
this change was caused principally by some delays in reaching full capacity at our modernized ilo smelter 
molybdenum production and sales increased and  respectively in when compared to the increases are principally due to higher grades at our peruvian mines and from la caridad mine which lost production in due to strikes 
mine zinc production amounted to million pounds in  a decrease from the decrease of million pounds in zinc production is mainly due to the strike losses at our taxco and san martin mines 
copper made up of net sales in compared with in sales of by products in totaled  million compared with  million in  an increase of 
the increase is principally attributable to the increase in the volume and sales prices for molybdenum 
this increase was partially reduced by lower volume and sales prices for zinc

the increase in cost of sales was principally due to million of higher production cost  including  million due to higher fuel and power cost  million of higher water cost at our mexican operations due to an increase in the water rate applicable to the mining industry  million of higher labor costs  million of higher repair costs  and million of other operating costs offset by million of lower metal purchased from third parties 
the increase in cost of sales also includes million of higher freight and selling cost mainly due to higher sale of concentrates  million of inventory consumption and million of higher workers participation 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense in was million  compared with million in  an increase of million 
the increase was principally due to higher labor costs of million and million of higher rental equipment and office maintenance cost at our mexican corporate office 
depreciation  amortization and depletion depreciation  amortization and depletion was in compared with million in  an increase of million over the increase includes additional charges of million at our peruvian operations  of which million was for our newly activated ilo smelter modernization project 
increases in depreciation  amortization and depletion in at our mexican operations amounted to million 
this increase includes million of higher amortization of capitalized leach material due to increased amounts capitalized in  million of accelerated depreciation of the processing plant equipment at pasta de conchos over the remaining mineral located in the open pit after the mine accident and million due to the activation of maintenance and replacement equipment 
exploration exploration expense in was million compared with million in  an increase of million over this increase includes million at our peruvian operations  and was principally for the tia maria project in the department of arequipa  where spending increased by million 
a feasibility study for the project was completed in and we are planning to begin the project in exploration expense at our mexican operation increased by million in and was principally for the surface drilling activity at santa barbara  san martin and santa eulalia 
interest expense interest expense in was million compared with million in  an increase of million 
interest expense increased in principally as a result of an increase in our average debt outstanding 
please see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of our financing program 
capitalized interest capitalized interest in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million

the table below presents information regarding the volume of our copper sales products 
year ended december  copper sales million pounds refined blister anode concentrates sx ew rod total mine copper production was  million pounds in  a decrease of from this decrease of million pounds included a decrease of million pounds from the mexican open pit operations  million pounds in the mexican underground mines and an increase of million pounds from the peruvian mines 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican open pit mines was principally the result of the day strike at la caridad mine and days of strike at the cananea mine 
the decrease of million pounds in the mexican underground mines was due to lower ore grades 
the increase of million pounds in production from the peruvian mines was principally due to higher ore grade and recovery in the cuajone mine 
molybdenum production decreased from million pounds in to million pounds in this decrease in production includes million pounds from la caridad due to the strike activity and million pounds from our peruvian operations mainly due to lower ore grade and recovery at the cuajone mine 
mine zinc production amounted to million pounds in  a decrease of million pounds or from this decrease was the result of lower production at three of immsa s zinc mines 
lower ore grades at charcas and santa barbara and reduced throughput at san martin were the prime reasons for the lower production 
production increases at two of the other immsa mines  taxco and santa eulalia  somewhat reduced the production losses 
the decrease in throughput at san martin was caused by a day strike in the first half of the increases in throughput at taxco and santa eulalia were caused by increased operating days at taxco  days were lost due to strike in  and the increase at santa eulalia was caused as production ramped up after a prolonged shutdown 
santa eulalia restarted operations at the end of after a three year shutdown 
a fire at the san luis potosi zinc refinery in the first quarter of  reduced refined zinc production in  we were  however  able to sell zinc concentrates on favorable terms until the refinery was fully operational  which occurred by the end of the third quarter of copper made up of net sales in compared with in sales of by products in totaled  million compared with  million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is principally attributable to the decrease in the volume and sales prices for molybdenum

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would also result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements 
based upon our indebtedness at december   a change in interest rates of one percent or basis points would impact net income and cash flows by million annually 
we are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates as certain costs incurred are in currencies other than our functional currency 
to manage the volatility related to the risk  we may enter into forward exchange contracts  currency swaps or other currency hedging arrangements 
we are subject to market risks arising from the volatility of copper and other metal prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged  and giving no effects to potential hedging programs metal price sensitivity factors would indicate estimated change in net earnings resulting from metal price changes in as provided in the table below 
copper molybdenum zinc silver change in metal prices per pound except silver per ounce change in net earnings in millions we occasionally use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices  interest rate and exchange rate risk exposures 
the company generally does not enter into derivative contracts unless it anticipates a future activity that is likely to occur that will result in exposing the company to market risk 
copper and zinc derivatives from time to time we enter into derivative instruments to protect a fixed copper  or zinc price for a portion of our metal sales

we did not hold any copper or zinc derivative contracts at the end of december transactions under these metal price protection programs are not accounted for as hedges under sfas no 
and are adjusted to fair market value based on the metal prices as of the last day of the respective reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in net sales on the consolidated combined statement of earnings 
in  the company changed its accounting classification policy to recognize gains or losses on metal price derivatives in net sales

at december   we did not hold any open gas swap contracts 
exchange rate derivatives  us dollar mexican peso contracts because more than of our sales collections in mexico are in us dollars and many of our costs are in mexican pesos  during and we entered into zero cost derivative contracts with the purpose of protecting  within a range  against an appreciation of the mexican peso to the us dollar 
in these contracts if the exchange rate settles at or below the barrier  we do not sell us dollars  if the exchange rate settles above the barrier price established in the contract we sell us dollars at the strike price established in the contract
