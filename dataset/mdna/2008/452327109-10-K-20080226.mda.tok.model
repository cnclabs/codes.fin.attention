overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function 
using our proprietary technologies  we provide a comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve the sequencing  genotyping and gene expression markets 
in the future  we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics 
our customers include leading genomic research centers  pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 
our tools provide researchers around the world with the performance  throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics 
we believe this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological function  which will enhance drug discovery and clinical research  allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual patients 
in april  we completed the acquisition of cyvera 
the aggregate consideration for the transaction was million  consisting of approximately million shares of our common stock and payment of approximately million of cyvera s liabilities at the closing 
on january   we completed the acquisition of solexa for approximately million shares of our common stock 
solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing  gene expressing analysis and small rna analysis 
we believe our combined company is the only company with genome scale technology for genotyping  gene expression and sequencing  the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis 
our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high value products and service projects  the impact of seasonal spending patterns  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform  changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns 
any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products  unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines  or impacts from the other factors mentioned above  could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 

table of contents as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
our losses have principally occurred as a result of acquired in process research and development charges of million related to our acquisition of solexa in  the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  a charge of million in primarily related to settlement of our litigation with affymetrix and million related to our acquisition of cyvera in we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments with respect to the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical if they require an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  or different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue consists of sales of arrays  reagents  flow cells  instrumentation and oligos 
service and other revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing services  extended warranty sales and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab no 
 revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of instrumentation is recognized when earned  which is generally upon shipment 
revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping and sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer 

table of contents in order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  we ensure there are no refund rights 
if payment terms are based on future performance or a right of return exists  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of sab no 
might result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one year warranty 
we also sell separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts  which are generally for one or two years  upon the expiration of the initial warranty 
revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period 
reserves are provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products were greater than our estimates  gross margins could be adversely affected 
while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  we do enter into agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine that the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
inventory valuation we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the release of new products that will supercede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues  historical experience and our current inventory levels 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset valuation our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our solexa and cyvera acquisitions 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology and customer relationships from the acquisition of solexa and licensed technology from the affymetrix settlement 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from i acquisitions  and ii litigation settlements 
in determining the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets arising from acquisitions  we used the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets  we used the discounted cash flow method in determining the value of licensed technology associated with the settlement of our affymetrix litigation 
this method required significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates were required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we used to value and amortize intangible assets were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
in addition  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect a change in revenue projections of would have on our intangible asset  noting the impact would be a reduction or increase in the value of the intangible asset of million 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
we have performed our annual test of goodwill as of may   noting no impairment  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill through december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of 
table of contents these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold required under sfas no 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 

table of contents results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december   december   and january  stated as a percentage of total revenue

revenue year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue total revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
this represents an increase of million for  or  compared to product revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  consumable products and instruments 
table of contents constituted and of product revenue for the year ended december   respectively  compared to and for the year ended december   respectively 
the change in sales associated with our product mix is due to increased sales in instruments primarily attributable to the genome analyzer  which was introduced during the first quarter of growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our infinium products 
we expect to see continued growth in product revenue  which can be mainly attributed to the launch of several new products  sales of existing products and the growth of our installed base of instruments 
service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service and other revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing service contracts and extended warranty contracts 
in  service and other revenue also includes research revenue 
historically  research revenue was included in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and iselect custom snp genotyping service contracts and sequencing services contracts 
we expect sales from snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of snp genotyping and sequencing services contracts are highly dependent on the customers schedules for delivering the snps and samples to us 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  warranty  packaging and delivery costs  as well as costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing services on behalf of our customers 
cost of product revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales 
cost of product revenue for the years ended december  and december  included non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
gross margin on product revenue decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily due to the shift in product mix towards instruments 
in addition  the gross margin percentage was adversely impacted by the increase in non cash stock based compensation expense as well as million associated with the amortization of inventory revaluation costs related to our acquisition of solexa in january the impact of non cash stock based compensation charges decreased our gross margin by basis points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the inventory revaluation costs decreased our gross margin by basis points for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cost of service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to higher service revenue 
gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the gross margin percentage is primarily driven by unfavorable product mix 

table of contents we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins 
we expect price competition to continue in our market  and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter as a result 
research and development expenses year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase for the year ended december  was due to higher research and development expenses associated with our acquisition of solexa in january costs to support our beadarray technology research activities increased approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an overall increase in personnel related expenses and increased lab and material expenses 
several new infinium chip products  including the human m dna analysis beadchip  humancnv duo beadchip and humanhap duo beadchip  have been introduced to the market in in addition  non cash stock based compensation expense increased approximately million compared to the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in research and development expenses related to the veracode technology  compared to the year ended december  we began shipping our beadxpress system  which is based on our veracode technology  during the first quarter of as a result of completing the development of this product  the related research and development expenses have decreased 
we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into additional markets 
accordingly  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our product base 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year december  sales and marketing expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increases of million attributable to personnel related expenses to support the growth of our business  million of non cash stock based compensation expense and million attributable to other non personnel related expenses consisting mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and new products 
general and administrative expense increased million during the year ended 
table of contents december   compared to the year ended december   due to increases of million in personnel related expenses associated with the growth of our business  million of non cash stock based compensation expense  million in outside legal fees  million in other outside service expenses  primarily due to increases in consulting fees and increased tax  audit  and other public company costs 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business 
amortization of acquired intangible assets year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands amortization of acquired intangible assets  n a amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled million for the year ended december  there was no amortization of acquired intangibles for the year ended december  the amount amortized in represents the amortization of our intangible assets acquired from solexa in january acquired in process research and development year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands acquired in process research and development  n a during the year ended december   we recorded million of acquired ipr d resulting from the solexa acquisition 
at the acquisition date  solexa s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily involved with the development of its genetic analysis platform for sequencing and expression profiling 
these in process research and development projects are comprised of solexa s reversible terminating nucleotide biochemistry platform  referred to as sequencing by synthesis sbs biochemistry  as well as solexa s reagent  analyzer and sequencing services related technologies  which were valued at million  million  million and million  respectively  at the acquisition date 
although these projects were approximately complete at the acquisition date  they had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts allocated to those projects were written off in the first quarter of  the period the acquisition was consummated 
acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial charges for acquired ipr d that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual operating results 
there were no charges resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in fiscal litigation settlements year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands litigation settlements  n a during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with two settlement agreements entered into subsequent to year end 
the total charge is comprised primarily of million related to a million settlement with affymetrix entered into on january  for certain patent litigation between the parties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this settlement 

table of contents interest income year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in interest income over the prior year was primarily driven by higher cash balances from the proceeds of our february convertible debt offering  cash acquired as part of the solexa acquisition  and improved operating cash flow 
in addition  we experienced higher effective interest rates on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest and other expense  net year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  consists of interest expense and other income and expenses related to net foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses 
interest and other expense  net  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily related to our convertible debt offering in february for the years ended december  and december   we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in net foreign currency transaction losses  respectively 
in  these foreign currency exchange losses were offset by million of foreign currency exchange gains associated with the sale of our secured convertible debentures with genizon biosciences  inc genizon in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sale of our debentures with genizon 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended year ended december  december  percentage change in thousands provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the provision consists of federal  state  and foreign income tax expense  offset in by the release of the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our us deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we utilized approximately million and million of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce our federal and state income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
in addition  we also had us federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively  which begin to expire in and respectively  unless previously utilized 
pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in our 
table of contents ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
previous limitations due to section and have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of december  as of december   we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized and  accordingly we released a portion of our valuation allowance  approximately million of which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision 
in addition  we established current and long term deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets of approximately million and million  respectively  and decreased the goodwill balances recorded in conjunction with the cyvera and solexa acquisitions by approximately million and million  respectively 
based upon the available evidence as of december   we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million and million against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets  respectively 
comparison of years ended december  and january  our fiscal year is or weeks ending the sunday closest to december  with quarters of or weeks ending the sunday closest to march  june  and september the years ended december  and january  were both weeks 
revenue year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands product revenue service and other revenue total revenue total revenue for the years ended december  and january  was million and million  respectively 
this represents an increase of million for  or  compared to product revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january  the increase in resulted primarily from higher consumable and beadstation sales 
growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products  the humanhap and humanhap beadchips 
in addition  growth in consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our installed base of beadarray readers  which has nearly doubled since january  consumable products constituted of product revenue for year ended december   compared to in the year ended january  we expect to see continued growth in product revenue  which can be partially attributed to the launch of several new products  as well as the growth of our installed base of instruments 
service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january  the increase in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several significant infinium and goldengate snp genotyping service contracts 
we introduced our infinium services in early we expect sales from snp genotyping services contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis  depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed 
the timing of completion of a snp genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the customer s schedule for delivering the snps and samples to us 
this increase in service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in government grants and other research funding of million over the prior year due primarily to the completion of several projects funded by grants from the national

we do not expect research revenue to be a material component of our revenue going forward 
cost of product and service and other revenue year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands cost of product revenue cost of service and other revenue total cost of product and service and other revenue cost of product and service and other revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  installation  warranty  packaging and delivery costs  as well as costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf of our customers 
costs related to research revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of product revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january   primarily driven by higher consumable and instrument sales 
cost of product revenue for the year ended december  included stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r totaling million 
gross margin on product revenue increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended january  the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix  as well as decreased manufacturing costs 
a higher percentage of our revenue in was generated from the sale of consumables  which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other products 
the decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our manufacturing processes 
this increase in gross margin was offset  in part  by the impact of stock based compensation charges  which decreased our gross margin by basis points in compared to cost of service and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january   primarily due to higher service revenue 
cost of service and other revenue for the year ended december  included stock based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r totaling million 
gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended january  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the mix of projects  as well as the impact of stock based compensation charges  the latter having decreased our service and other revenue gross margin by basis points in compared to we expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross margins 
however  we expect our market to become increasingly price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses year ended year ended december  january  percentage change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products

the primary cash outflows during the year ended december  were attributable to the purchase of available for sale securities for approximately million  the repurchase of an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for approximately million  as well as approximately million for the purchase of a convertible note hedge 
these convertible note transactions and our stock repurchase program are discussed in detail below 
on february   we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and offering expenses  were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the offering 
we used million of the net proceeds of this offering to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  which are designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes 
we are using the balance of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
the notes mature on february  and bear interest semi annually at a rate of per year  payable on february and august of each year  beginning on august  in addition  we may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay additional interest 
if a designated event  as defined in the indenture for the notes  occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes  we must pay the principal portion in cash 
the notes will become convertible only in certain circumstances based on conditions relating to the trading price of the notes and our common stock or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events  and we expect the notes to become convertible beginning in the second quarter of if the trading price of our common stock does not decline from current levels

table of contents we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next months 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the present time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
due to expansion of our facilities and manufacturing operations  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures during our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize our sequencing and veracode technologies and to expand our snp genotyping and sequencing services product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce the potential equity dilution  we entered into a convertible note hedge contract entitling us to purchase a maximum of  shares of our common stock subject to adjustment at an initial strike price of per share subject to adjustment 
upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  this hedge contract is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume weighted average price per share of our commons stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge 
we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the convertible note hedge transactions entitling them to acquire a maximum of  shares of our common stock subject to adjustment at an initial strike price of per share subject to adjustment 
the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during the measurement period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants 
we did not hold any material derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk although most of our revenue is realized in us dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity
