item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to help the reader gain a better understanding of our financial condition and our results of operations 
it is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
executive summary fiscal year was a very challenging year 
our results of operations for the year ended march  were materially affected by continuing adverse conditions impacting our homebuilding and mortgage lending operations 
the market conditions continued to deteriorate significantly during the year ended march   and we are unable to predict whether they will deteriorate further  improve or what effects any future changes in market conditions would have on our business or results of operations 
a summary of our results of operations by line of business is as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended march  revenues home building financial services other total earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes home building financial services other total revenues for the year ended march  were billion  which represents a decrease compared to the year ended march  earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march  decreased to a loss of billion 
the decrease in our revenues and the loss from continuing operations before income taxes during the year ended march  are primarily attributable to continuing adverse conditions affecting our homebuilding and mortgage lending operations 
beginning in fiscal year  the us housing industry began to experience a significant downturn  which directly and adversely affected  and continues to adversely affect  our business and results of operations 
we believe the principal factors that have caused this downturn include each of the following  the impact of which varies based upon geographic market  product segment and the time since commencement of the downturn increased inventory of new and existing homes for sale  including the impact of increases in residential foreclosures  reduced availability and increased cost of mortgage financing due to the significant mortgage market disruptions  a decrease in the affordability of housing in selected markets as a result of significant price appreciation in the years preceding the downturn and tightened credit standards for homebuyers  a decline in homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the consumer real estate market and an inability of many homebuyers to sell their existing homes  and pricing pressures resulting from a variety of factors  including the decision of homebuilders to offer significant discounts and sales incentives  to liquidate unsold inventories in order to generate cash  and the need for home prices to fall within mortgage qualification limits 
the inventory of new and existing homes for sale remains high as homebuilders have continued to build homes and attempt to liquidate unsold inventory as residential foreclosures continue to increase 
the decline in homebuyer demand can be attributed to  in part  concerns of prospective homebuyers that prices will continue to decline and  in fact  the excess supply of homes for sale and the need for builders to generate cash have caused homebuilders and other home sellers to reduce prices 
in addition  many prospective homebuyers have been unable to sell their existing homes 
moreover  during fiscal year  the mortgage markets experienced significant disruptions which led to an unprecedented combination of reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  tightened credit requirements for homebuyers  reduced mortgage loan liquidity and increased credit risk premiums 
as a result  prospective borrowers experienced more difficulty or greater expense in obtaining loans  or were subject to increased credit score or down payment requirements  which further reduced the demand for homes and mortgage loans during the year 
these market conditions materially impacted home building s operating results for the year ended march  as evidenced by the following a  million decrease in homebuilding revenues  net of discounts   million in land related impairments  million in losses on land sales  million in write offs of land deposits and pre acquisition costs  million in our share of joint ventures impairments  and million in goodwill impairments 
during the year  we assessed our neighborhoods and land for possible land related impairments 
the market conditions during the year adversely impacted anticipated future selling prices  sales rates and other assumptions included in our impairment evaluations  and we recorded significant impairments totaling  million 
during the year ended march   land related impairments were recorded representing neighborhoods and land investments  certain of which have been impaired more than once 
land related impairments during the year ended march  represented neighborhoods and land investments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded million in impairments 
at march   the remaining carrying value of neighborhoods and land investments for which an impairment was recorded in the quarter ended march  was million 
if market conditions worsen  or if any of our assumptions are adjusted negatively in future periods  we may have additional land related impairments  which could be significant 
in march  we sold a portfolio of developed  partially developed and undeveloped properties to a joint venture funded principally by certain investment funds for million in cash 
the portfolio of assets sold includes properties that represent  lots in neighborhoods across states  with the majority located in california and nevada 
in march  we also sold a portfolio of five resort second home properties to a third party for million in cash  net of million in seller financing for one of the properties 
the resort second home properties sold include properties located in texas  north carolina and new hampshire 
total losses related to these transactions were approximately million 
these transactions resulted in the realization of significant tax losses and a refund from tax authorities of taxes paid in prior years 
these transactions are consistent with our near term goals of reducing our land supply and generating cash 
these land sales accelerate our move to a more asset light operating model  sharpen our focus on core markets and consumer segments  reduce future land development cash obligations and monetize approximately million of our deferred tax assets 
for additional information on these land sale transactions  please refer to the home building discussion later in this section 
our homebuilding operations also experienced a significant decline in operating margin primarily attributable to lower home prices  increases in discounts and sales incentives  including increases in seller paid financing and closing costs  and increases in sales commissions to help stimulate sales and close homes 
in addition  customer cancellation rates remain elevated when compared to historical levels 
customer discounts have increased since the fourth quarter of fiscal year customer discounts increased to of housing revenues for the year ended march   up from for the year ended march  as a percentage of revenues  closing and financing costs have increased from to for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  sales commissions  as a percentage of revenues  have increased from to for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  financial services operating loss for the year ended march  was million as compared to operating earnings of million for the year ended march  for the year ended march   mortgage loan origination volume decreased 
this change is primarily attributable to the adverse conditions in the mortgage markets described above  which also resulted in a significant decrease in revenues and a million increase in provisions for losses on mortgages loans for the year ended march  continued adverse market conditions and further declines in homebuyer demand could have a negative impact on financial services future operating results 
we anticipate that our business and results of operations will continue to be affected by the difficult industry conditions for some time 
in general  we believe that our existing sources of funding  including cash flow from operations and our committed credit facilities are adequate to meet our currently anticipated operating needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  further deterioration in market conditions  including lower demand or prices for our homes or further disruptions of the mortgage markets  would likely result in declines in sales of our homes  accumulation of unsold inventory and margin deterioration  as well as potential additional land related impairments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs  which could reduce cash flow and profits and require that we seek amendments or waivers to our credit facilities to ensure continued availability of committed debt financing 
we believe the fundamentals that support homebuyer demand in the long term remain solid and the current market conditions will moderate and improve over time  however  we cannot predict the duration of the current market conditions 
we continue to adjust our operations in response to market conditions by reducing our unsold inventory  reducing our land position  and lowering our costs 
our unsold inventory has decreased from  units as of march  to  units as of march  since march   our total land position has decreased by  lots or 
further  home building s selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased from  million for the year ended march  to  million for the year ended march  we are also working to reduce the costs of constructing our homes  although in many cases  cost savings will not be realized until future periods 
during the year ended march   we generated  million in cash flows from operating activities  which was primarily derived through decreases in home building s inventories and financial services proceeds from sales of mortgage loans that were not reinvested in new mortgage loans 
the decreases in home building s inventories were primarily the result of units closed and reductions in land acquisition and development 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year home building the following summarizes the results of our home building operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in thousands except per unit data for the years ended march  change change revenues housing revenues land sales and other cost of sales housing cost of sales land sales and other selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairments earnings loss from unconsolidated entities other income operating earnings loss  nm  operating earnings loss as a percentage of revenues housing operations total homebuilding operations nm not meaningful earnings loss from unconsolidated entities include our share of joint ventures impairments 
operating earnings loss represent home building s earnings exclusive of certain homebuilding corporate general and administrative expenses 
operating earnings loss from housing operations is a non gaap financial measure  which we believe is useful to investors as it allows them to separate housing operations from activities related to land holdings  options to acquire land and related land valuation adjustments 
management uses this non gaap financial measure to aid in evaluating the performance of its ongoing housing projects 
operating earnings from housing operations is equal to housing revenues less housing cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are set forth in the table above 
home building consists of the following reporting segments with operations located in the following states east georgia savannah only  maryland  new jersey  north carolina  south carolina and virginia southeast florida  georgia atlanta only and tennessee central indiana  illinois  michigan  minnesota and missouri texas texas northwest colorado  hawaii  nevada except las vegas  northern california  oregon  washington southwest arizona  southern california  nevada las vegas only  new mexico other homebuilding other homebuilding includes certain resort second home projects in florida that we plan to build out and liquidate  and holding companies 
in addition  other homebuilding includes amounts consolidated under the caption land held under option agreements not owned and capitalized interest for all regions 
for the years ended march  change change units closed east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding average revenue per unit east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding total home building revenues housing revenues decreased for the year ended march  as compared to fiscal year due to decreases in units closed and average revenue per unit 
for the year ended march   average revenue per unit which is net of customer discounts decreased primarily as a result of increases in discounts and lower prices experienced in many of our markets 
customer discounts increased to of housing revenues for the year ended march   up from for fiscal year for the year ended march   our closings declined when compared to the prior year as a result of decreases in sales orders caused principally by the challenging market conditions as described above 
revenues from land sales and other increased to million for the year ended march  as compared to the prior year 
although the timing and amount of land sales vary from period to period  the increase in revenues from land sales is primarily the result of the sale of a portfolio of properties to a joint venture  the sale of a portfolio of five resort second home properties and other sales of land that required significant future development spending and did not meet our strategic objectives 
changes in average operating neighborhoods and closings per average neighborhood are outlined in the table below 
for the years ended march  change change average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood we define a neighborhood as an individual active selling location targeted to a specific buyer segment that has completed at least one sale and has ten or more units remaining to sell 
our neighborhood count as of march  was neighborhoods  and it has steadily decreased to a neighborhood count of as of march  the drop in neighborhood count is primarily the result of our decision to build out and not reinvest in certain markets and our decision to sell certain properties that did not meet our strategic initiatives 
operating margins homebuilding operating margins consisting of operating earnings or loss as a percentage of revenues declined to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in homebuilding operating margins as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the following factors decreases in revenues  net of discounts  land related and goodwill impairments  losses on land sales  write offs of land deposits and pre acquisition costs  and our share of joint ventures impairments 
the million in losses from unconsolidated entities for the year ended march  includes million of our share of joint ventures impairments and losses 
home building s operating margins were impacted by million in losses on land sales 
in march  we sold a portfolio of developed  partially developed and undeveloped properties to a joint venture funded principally by certain investment funds for million in cash 
the portfolio of assets sold includes properties that represent  lots in properties across states  with the majority located in california and nevada 
the joint venture is led by rsf partners  inc and includes funds under management by farallon capital management  llc and greenfield partners  llc we have a interest in the joint venture  and we have the right to receive a greater share of distributions if certain financial targets are met 
we deposited with the joint venture million for options to purchase lots 
included in revenues land sales and other is million related to this transaction which excludes proceeds for lots sold and subsequently optioned back from the joint venture which was accounted for as a financing transaction 
the book value of the properties sold was million  excluding capitalized interest of million 
in connection with the sale  we incurred million in transaction costs 
cost of sales land sales and other includes million and cost of sales housing includes million related to this transaction 
in march  we also sold a portfolio of five resort second home properties to a third party for million in cash  net of million in seller financing for one of the properties 
the resort second home properties sold include properties located in texas  north carolina and new hampshire 
we have agreed to finance future construction on two of the properties sold for a maximum commitment of million 
we have a contingent receivable of million that will be recognized if and when the contingency is resolved 
these transactions are consistent with our near term goals of reducing our land supply and generating cash 
these land sales accelerate our move to a more asset light operating model  sharpen our focus on core markets and consumer segments  reduce future land development cash obligations and monetize a portion of our deferred tax assets through the expected receipt of a tax refund of approximately million 
homebuilding operating margins were also significantly impacted by  million of land related impairments in the year ended march  we regularly assess our land holdings  including our lot options  taking into consideration changing market conditions and other factors 
in connection with our quarterly neighborhood assessments  during the quarter ended march   we reviewed approximately housing projects and land investments for potential land related impairments 
approximately of these housing projects are owned land positions that are either designated as active neighborhoods  are under development but are not considered active neighborhoods  are currently held for sale or will be developed in future periods 
the remaining housing projects represent controlled land positions approved for purchase 
land related impairments during the quarter ended march  represented neighborhoods and land investments  some of which have been impaired more than once 
in addition to land related impairments  we recorded million in goodwill impairments  which represents of our total homebuilding goodwill balance at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the goodwill impairments contributed to the decrease in homebuilding operating margins for the year ended march  also  during the year ended march   we determined it was probable we would not exercise certain lot option contracts  which resulted in a write off of option contracts and related pre acquisition costs  resulting in a remaining balance of outstanding option contracts and deposits including contracts in the due diligence process at march  the following table summarizes home building s impairments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs  excluding our share of joint ventures impairments dollars in thousands for the years ended march  goodwill land related land related goodwill land related land related impairments impairments write offs impairments impairments write offs east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding land related impairments include direct construction impairments of million for the year ended march  we assess the recoverability of our investment in land holdings on a quarterly basis 
continued deterioration in demand and market conditions could result in significant additional impairments and a decision to not exercise additional lot option contracts  which would result in additional write offs 
in addition  we could incur additional losses and impairments related to our joint ventures 
please refer to inventory valuation in the critical accounting estimates and to note c  inventories  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on our land holdings 
home building s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended march  when compared to fiscal year although the decrease in home building s selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended march  was substantial  representing a decrease of as compared to the prior year  the percentage decrease did not keep pace with the percentage decrease in home building s revenues  which were less than the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  is primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefit costs as a result of reductions in personnel and decreases in our estimated performance related incentive compensation 
as a percentage of revenues during the year ended march   we increased advertising and marketing costs  sales commissions and sales incentives  when compared to the prior year  to help stimulate sales orders and sell our existing inventory 
the following table summarizes home building s selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing other selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues sales orders  backlog units and land holdings the following tables summarize sales orders and backlog units for the years ended march  change change sales orders in units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding sales per average neighborhood as of march  change change backlog units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding for the year ended march   sales orders declined in all of the regions in which we do business when compared to the prior year except for the other homebuilding segment 
we expect that the decreases in sales orders will have a negative impact on our closings in fiscal year as previously discussed  some of the factors we believe are contributing to the decrease in sales orders are a continued decline in homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the consumer real estate market  as well as the inability of some prospective buyers to sell their existing homes 
the decline in homebuyer demand has also been caused by the tightened homebuyer credit requirements 
these factors are evidenced by lower customer traffic and cancellation rates that are much higher than our long term average cancellation rates ranging from to 
for the years ended march  and  cancellation rates were and  respectively 
in light of the continuing adverse market conditions  our strategy is to focus on selling homes and reducing inventories  reducing costs  generating cash and simplifying our business 
we curtailed speculative housing starts so that we could reduce our speculative inventory and facilitate our transition to an operating model more focused on constructing homes from a sold backlog 
total speculative inventory decreased to  units  excluding models  at march  compared to  units at march  we have also taken steps to reduce our land position 
the following table summarizes our land position as of march  lots lots lots lots owned controlled total lots owned controlled total lots east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding change capitalized costs related to lots owned are included in land under development and land held for development and sale 
lot counts related to completed homes or homes under construction are excluded from the totals above 
the dollar amounts related to these lot counts are classified as direct construction  a component of housing projects  in our consolidated balance sheets 
the direct construction lot counts as of march  and march  were  and  respectively  including  and  respectively  of lots for model homes completed or under construction 
we decreased our total land position when compared to march  with the most pronounced declines occurring in lots controlled 
the decrease in our land position for the year ended march  is a result of our decision to decrease land purchases and new lot option arrangements and our decision to sell certain parcels of land 
based on current market conditions  we believe we are oversupplied in total lots in certain markets and will continue to seek opportunities to reduce our land position 
these steps may include one or more sales of land 
as compared to march   our total land position has decreased by  lots or 
included in our total land position are  and  lots controlled through joint venture arrangements as of march  and  respectively 
we have completed due diligence on  lots of the  lots we control 
generally  lots where we have completed due diligence have more substantial deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred  and the deposits are non refundable 
regional discussion changes in revenues and operating earnings for our homebuilding reporting segments are outlined in the table below for the years ended march  change change revenues east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding operating earnings loss east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding  nm  east revenues decreased for the year ended march  primarily due to significant decreases in revenues in the hilton head  washington  dc  myrtle beach and new jersey markets 
these same four markets were also primarily the reason for the decrease in units closed when compared to the year ended march  average revenue per unit decreased when compared to the prior year  with the largest decrease occurring in the washington  dc market 
discounts as a percentage of housing revenues increased to  as all markets in the east region experienced an increase in discounts 
sales orders decreased when compared to the prior year primarily due to decreases in customer traffic and neighborhood counts  while cancellation rates improved slightly from to for the current fiscal year 
operating earnings decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to the prior year with most of the decrease occurring in the washington  dc  myrtle beach and new jersey markets 
the decrease in operating earnings is primarily the result of losses on land sales and a decrease in average revenue per unit and increases in discounts and sales incentives 
southeast for the year ended march   a decrease in units closed was the primary contributor to the decrease in revenues when compared to the year ended march  all markets in the southeast region experienced substantial decreases in revenues and units closed 
average revenue per unit decreased when compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in discounts from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  although cancellation rates improved from to for the current fiscal year  sales orders decreased 
significant sales order increases were experienced in the southwest florida and nashville markets primarily due to improvements in cancellation rates and traffic counts 
the southeast region incurred an operating loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to earnings of million in the prior year 
the nashville market was the only market in the southeast region that reported operating earnings for the year ended march  a substantial portion of the operating loss for fiscal year can be attributed to the southwest florida and southeast florida markets  which also recorded the majority of the land related impairments  losses on land sales and goodwill impairments in the region 
central revenues for the year ended march  decreased primarily due to a decrease in units closed as compared to the year ended march  all markets in the central region experienced significant decreases in units closed 
discounts as a percentage of housing revenues increased to for the year ended march   which contributed to the decrease in average revenue per unit 
sales orders decreased as the region experienced a decrease in customer traffic 
cancellation rates improved slightly from to when compared to the prior year 
the majority of the central region s operating loss of million for the year ended march  can be attributed to land related impairments and losses on land sales 
the detroit market recognized the majority of the central region s land related impairments 
all markets within the central region reported a decrease in operating earnings for the year ended march  texas revenues for the texas region for the year ended march  decreased compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to an decrease in units closed  which was partially offset by a increase in average revenue per unit 
all markets within the texas region experienced decreases in revenues and units closed 
the largest dollar decrease in revenues occurred in the dallas ft 
worth market  which also experienced the largest decrease in units closed 
average revenue per unit increased in all markets in the texas region  despite an increase in discounts from to for the year ended march  sales orders decreased 
the largest decrease in sales orders occurred in the dallas ft 
worth market where customer traffic has declined and cancellation rates have increased 
operating earnings for the year ended march  were million  a million decrease when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the texas region was the only one of our regions to realize operating earnings 
the decrease in operating earnings is primarily the result of discounts and sales incentives  and a loss on a land sale in the dallas ft 
worth market 
to date  the texas region has been less affected by the challenging market conditions experienced in other regions  which we believe results from the moderate growth rates and price appreciation realized in this region in prior periods 
in addition  the texas region has been the least impacted by land related impairments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs 
northwest revenues for the year ended march  decreased as compared to the year ended march   which was due to a combination of a decrease in average revenue per unit and a decrease in units closed 
all markets in the northwest region experienced decreases in revenues with the exception of the reno market 
the reno market was the only market within the northwest region to experience an increase in average revenue per unit and units closed 
discounts as a percentage of housing revenues increased to for the year ended march   with the largest increase occurring in the sacramento market 
sales orders for the year ended march  decreased primarily due to decreases in customer traffic and neighborhood counts 
the reno market was the only market within the northwest region to experience an increase in sales orders 
the northwest region experienced an operating loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to earnings of million in the prior year 
almost all of the operating loss  which includes significant land related impairments and losses on land sales  was realized in the reno  bay area and sacramento markets 
the portland and hawaii markets were the only markets within the region to generate operating earnings 
southwest the decrease in the southwest region s revenues for the year ended march  was primarily due to a decrease in units closed and an decrease in average revenue per unit when compared to the prior year 
the largest decreases in units closed were experienced in the southern california coastal and inland empire markets 
the southwest region experienced the largest decrease in average revenue per unit of all of our regions 
additionally  discounts as a percentage of housing revenues increased to for the year ended march   with the most significant discounts offered in the phoenix market 
sales orders decreased when compared to the year ended march  despite the fact that cancellation rates improved from to for the year ended march  the southwest region experienced operating losses of  million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the southwest region incurred the most substantial operating losses of all of our regions for the year 
the most significant operating losses occurred in the phoenix and inland empire markets 
the operating loss for the year ended march  includes million in land related impairments and million in losses on land sales 
the operating loss is also reflective of a decrease in average revenue per unit  which was not offset by commensurate reductions in construction costs  and increases in discounts and sales incentives 
other homebuilding other homebuilding is primarily comprised of certain operating segments that are not part of our long term strategy 
the projects in these operating segments will be built out and liquidated 
certain homebuilding ancillary businesses and certain income and expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments are reported in this segment 
the other homebuilding region experienced an operating loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
this decrease in operating earnings is primarily the result of million in land related impairments in the year ended march  these land related impairments were all recognized on projects located in texas  north carolina and new hampshire in connection with the sale of certain resort second home properties 
financial services the financial services segment is primarily engaged in the residential mortgage lending business  as well as other financial services that are in large part related to the residential mortgage market 
its operations include mortgage lending and other related services for purchasers of homes sold by our homebuilding operations and other homebuilders  refinancing of existing mortgages  title agency services and the sale of title insurance and other insurance products  including property and casualty 
as a result of the significant disruptions in the mortgage markets and the related reductions in the mortgage market liquidity  during fiscal year  we began to focus our mortgage operations on builder loans to support home building 
retail mortgage originations represented approximately   and of total mortgage originations during the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
however  we expect retail mortgage originations to decline during the fiscal year ending march  we anticipate the reduction in total retail mortgage originations may have a negative impact on financial services operating results 
financial services revenues and operating earnings are derived primarily from the sale of mortgage loans  together with all related servicing rights  broker fees  title and other various insurance coverages  interest income and other fees 
net origination fees  mortgage servicing rights  and other revenues derived from the origination of mortgage loans are deferred and recognized when the related loan is sold to a third party purchaser 
interest revenues on mortgage loans receivable are recognized using the interest actuarial method 
other revenues  including fees for title insurance  mortgage broker and other services performed in connection with mortgage lending activities  are recognized as earned 
in the normal course of our activities  we carry inventories of loans pending sale to third party investors and earn an interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
generally  our business strategy is to originate and sell loans rather than hold them  which reduces our capital investment and related risks 
following unprecedented disruptions in the mortgage markets during the second quarter of fiscal year  ctx mortgage company  llc discontinued sales of mortgage loans to hsf i  and is now relying on committed bank warehouse credit facilities to provide funding for its loan originations 
hsf i was a variable interest entity of which we were the primary beneficiary  and it was consolidated in our financial statements 
in november  we terminated hsf i and all of its outstanding obligations were redeemed 
the following summarizes financial services results for the two year period ended march  dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating earnings loss operating margin financial services margin net interest income average interest earning assets average yield average interest bearing liabilities average rate paid financial services margin is a non gaap financial measure  which we believe is useful as it allows investors to assess the operating performance of our financial services operations by netting the cost of funding mortgage originations interest expense against the related interest income 
financial services margin is equal to operating earnings as a percentage of financial services revenues less interest expense  all of which are set forth in the table above 
financial services revenues for the year ended march  decreased as compared to the prior year due to decreases in gain on sale of mortgage loans  broker fees and interest income 
contributing to the decrease in interest income and average yield was an increase in contractually delinquent loans that are not accruing interest 
interest accruals are suspended  except for interest accruals related to insured mortgage loans  when the mortgage loan becomes contractually delinquent for days or more 
at march  and  mortgage loans  on which revenue was not being accrued  were million and million  respectively 
for the year ended march   cost of sales  which is solely comprised of interest expense  declined as compared to the prior year as a result of decreases in average interest bearing liabilities 
these decreases in average interest bearing liabilities were partially offset by the effect of higher short term borrowing costs 
during the year ended march   financial services recorded significant mortgage loan loss provisions as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the most significant provision during the year ended march  was recorded in connection with financial services construction loans 
a construction loan is a loan supporting the construction of a home on the borrower s lot 
construction on the home must be completed before a construction loan can be modified into a permanent loan ie  a mortgage loan held for sale and sold to a third party 
due to their lengthy holding period  construction loans are susceptible to market value and credit risks 
recent significant changes in the mortgage markets  declining property values and increasing delinquencies were the primary drivers behind the significant loss provisions recorded by financial services during the year ended march  these factors also contributed to financial services decision in the second quarter of fiscal year to discontinue the origination of new construction loans 
for additional information on financial services provisions  please refer to our critical accounting estimates  mortgage loan allowances and related reserve 
the following table summarizes financial services provisions dollars in thousands for the years ended march  provision for losses on mortgage loans provision for losses on real estate owned anticipated losses for loans originated total provisions in addition to the provisions discussed above  financial services recorded a million impairment on its construction loans during the year ended march  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above was partially offset by decreases in branch operating expenses  branch and corporate compensation  and sales incentives 
operating margin and financial services margin for the year ended march  decreased primarily due to increases in loss provisions 
the following table provides a comparative analysis of the volume of loan sales to investors third parties and the gains on those sales and related derivative activity  known collectively as gain on sale of mortgage loans  and loans brokered to third party lenders and fees received for related broker services for the years ended march  and dollars in thousands  except for average loan size and volume for the years ended march  change change loan sales to investors volume in millions number of loans sold gain on sale of mortgage loans loans brokered to third party lenders volume in millions number of brokered loans broker fees average loan size loans sold to investors loans brokered to third party lenders in addition to a decrease in the volume of loan sales to investors  gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased for the year ended march  primarily as a result of unfavorable pricing on the sale of mortgage loan products that have been eliminated due to the disruptions in the mortgage markets  and accelerated mortgage loan sales necessitated by the termination of hsf i which negatively impacted financial services liquidity 
the unfavorable pricing on mortgage loans was partially offset by a shift in the product mix of loans originated to more conforming loans  which generate higher service release premiums than nonconforming loans 
broker fee income decreased for the year ended march  as a result of a decrease in the volume of loans brokered to third party lenders 
the decrease in broker volume is also primarily due to the significant disruptions in the mortgage markets  including the significant reduction of homebuyers access to nonconforming mortgage products 
we track loan applications until such time as the loan application is closed as an originated loan or cancelled 
the application data presented below includes loan applications  which resulted in originated loans in the period presented and applications for loans scheduled to close in subsequent periods 
for the years ended march  change change open applications beginning new applications cancelled applications originated loans open applications ending the table below provides a comparative analysis of mortgage loan originations for the years ended march  and for the years ended march  change change origination volume in millions number of originated loans builder retail average loan size originated loans total originations for the year ended march  decreased primarily as a result of a decline in homebuyer demand and a reduction in the number of mortgage product offerings 
refinancing activity accounted for and of our originations for the years ended march  and  respectively 
for the years ended march  and  financial services originated and  respectively  of the non cash unit closings of home building s customers 
beginning in early  the mortgage markets were affected by declines in values and increased default levels of sub prime mortgage loans 
the deterioration of the mortgage markets accelerated during the second quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in the virtual elimination of the nonconforming mortgage market which would include sub prime mortgage loans 
as a result  financial services has essentially ceased originating sub prime or other nonconforming loans 
further disruptions in the mortgage markets could further reduce the population of potential mortgage customers and or the profit on loans we originate  and in turn  negatively impact financial services future operating results 
other our other segment includes corporate general and administrative expense 
the following summarizes the components of the other segment s loss from continuing operations before income tax dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change corporate general and administrative expense interest expense other  nm  operating loss included in other for the year ended march  is a million gain on the sale of an airplane and interest income 
corporate general and administrative expense represents corporate employee compensation and benefits  professional services and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent  utilities and travel costs 
the following table summarizes corporate general and administrative expense dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits professional services rent and utilities travel other general and administrative expense among other items  other general and administrative expense includes reimbursement of certain costs that have been billed to the home building operating segments 
the decrease in corporate general and administrative expense in fiscal year versus the prior year is primarily related to decreases in compensation and benefits 
the decrease in compensation and benefits is a result of reductions in personnel at our corporate offices and decreases in our performance related incentive compensation 
income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended march  as compared to the previous fiscal year s tax provision of million 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended march  differed from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the recognition of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties 
see note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our valuation allowance 
the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended march  which differed from the statutory rate primarily due to provisions for tax contingencies 
discontinued operations on march   we sold construction services to an unrelated third party and received million in cash  net of related expenses and as adjusted for the estimated settlement of post closing adjustments 
the effect of the post closing adjustment was estimated in our calculation of the gain on sale of construction services for the year ended march   but was subject to change 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the amount of the post closing adjustment was determined 
in connection with the sale  we will also receive an aggregate of million in cash to be paid in annual installments of million over a year period 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we received our first million annual installment payment 
the post closing adjustment and the million annual installment payment are reflected as additional gain on sale of construction services for the year ended march  in march  we signed a definitive agreement to sell our home services operations to an unrelated third party 
as a result  our home services operations are now reflected as a discontinued operation in our financial statements 
on april  we completed the sale and received million in cash  which is subject to post closing adjustments 
for additional information on our discontinued operations  see note o  discontinued operations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
construction services discontinued operations for construction services are as follows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  revenues operating earnings pre tax gain on sale after the sale of construction services  we remain responsible for certain surety bond obligations relating to construction services projects commenced prior to march  at march   these surety bonds have a total face amount of billion  although the risk of liability with respect to these surety bonds declines as the relevant construction projects are performed 
we estimate that million of work remains to be performed on these projects at march  in connection with certain of these surety bond obligations  we provided certain sureties with a million letter of credit 
in connection with the sale of construction services  the purchaser has agreed to indemnify us against losses relating to such surety bond obligations  including amounts that may be drawn under such letter of credit 
in addition  we have purchased for our benefit an additional back up indemnity provided by a financial institution with an a s p and a moody s credit rating 
the obligation of such financial institution under the back up indemnity is million as of march   which declines to million over time and terminates in home services discontinued operations for our home services operations are as follows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  revenues operating loss the increase in home services revenues as compared to the prior year is the result of an expanded customer base 
we had thousand pest defense customers as of march  as compared to thousand as of march  the decrease in operating losses realized by our home services operations for the year ended march  is primarily due to the increase in revenues and leverage in selling  general and administrative expenses

for the year ended march   average revenue per unit increased primarily as a result of price increases being largely offset by increases in discounts and lower prices experienced in many of our markets 
customer discounts increased to of housing revenues for the year ended march   up from for fiscal year for the year ended march   our closings declined when compared to fiscal year as a result of decreases in sales orders caused principally by increased cancellations and decreased customer traffic 
this decrease in closings was a direct result of challenging market conditions 
revenues from land sales and other increased to million for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  we increased our land sales in fiscal year to address our oversupply of land in certain markets 
changes in average operating neighborhoods and closings per average neighborhood are outlined in the table below 
for the years ended march  change change average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood the increase in average operating neighborhoods for the year ended march  was a result of closing out of neighborhoods at a slower rate as compared to fiscal year due to a decrease in sales

for the year ended march   we opened new neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods 
operating margins homebuilding operating margins declined to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in homebuilding operating margins as compared to the year ended march  was primarily attributable to the following factors decreases in revenues  net of discounts  land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs  land related impairments  and our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture 
the losses from joint ventures were the primary cause of the significant decrease in earnings from unconsolidated entities when compared to fiscal year homebuilding operating margins were also significantly impacted by a million increase in cost of sales land sales and other 
we periodically reassess our land holdings  including our lot options  while taking into consideration changing market conditions and other factors 
during the year ended march   we determined it was probable we would not exercise certain lot option contracts  which resulted in a write off of certain option contracts and related pre acquisition costs 
these determinations were made in light of increased housing inventory  a decline in homebuyer demand  increased cancellations and deteriorating market conditions in the homebuilding industry 
the deteriorating market conditions also resulted in significant land related impairments 
in connection with our quarterly neighborhood assessments  during the quarter ended march   we reviewed approximately  housing projects and land investments for potential land related impairments 
approximately  of these housing projects were owned land positions that were either designated as active neighborhoods or were under development and were not considered active 
the remaining housing projects represented controlled land positions approved for purchase 
during fiscal year  we recorded land related impairments on neighborhoods and land investments 
also during fiscal year  we wrote off land deposits and pre acquisition costs related to option contracts  resulting in outstanding option contracts and deposits including contracts in the due diligence process at march  the following table summarizes home building s land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs and land related impairments included in cost of sales land sales and other dollars in thousands for the years ended march  land related land related land related land related impairments write offs impairments write offs east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding operating margins also decreased due to increases in operating segments selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended march  due to increases in advertising  marketing and sales commissions to stimulate sales in light of current housing industry conditions 
this increase in selling related expenses was offset by decreases in compensation and benefit costs  including bonuses and profit sharing 
the following table summarizes home building s selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended march  change change compensation and benefits sales commissions advertising and marketing other selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues sales orders  backlog units and land holdings the following tables summarize sales orders and backlog units for the years ended march  change change sales orders in units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding sales per average neighborhood as of march  change change backlog units east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding for the year ended march   sales orders declined in all of the regions in which we do business with significant declines in most regions and more moderate declines in the texas and northwest regions 
these declines led to a significant decrease in backlog in substantially all regions 
as previously discussed  some of the factors we believe were contributing to the decrease in sales orders and backlog were a continued decline in homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the consumer real estate market  increased inventory of new and existing homes for sale  and lower prices resulting from the imbalance between supply and demand 
these factors were evidenced by lower customer traffic and increased cancellation rates 
for the year ended march  and  cancellation rates were and  respectively 
in light of the challenging market conditions  our strategy was to focus on increasing our inventory turns and generating cash 
as a result  we increased advertising costs  sales commissions and sales incentives to help stimulate sales orders and sell our existing inventory 
we also curtailed speculative housing starts to reduce our speculative inventory 
we also reduced our land position 
the following table summarizes our land position as of march  and as of march  lots lots lots lots owned controlled total lots owned controlled total lots east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding change we decreased our total land position when compared to march  with the most pronounced declines occurring in lots controlled 
the decrease in our land position for the year ended march  was a result of our decision to decrease land purchases and new lot option arrangements  as well as our determination that it was probable we would not acquire certain existing lots controlled under option agreements 
included in our total land position were  and  lots controlled through joint venture arrangements as of march  and  respectively 
regional discussion changes in revenues and operating earnings for our homebuilding reporting segments are outlined in the table below for the years ended march  change change revenues east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding operating earnings loss east southeast central texas northwest southwest other homebuilding east revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in units closed when compared to fiscal year the largest decrease in unit closings occurred in the new jersey and washington dc markets 
the decrease in unit closings experienced in the new jersey and washington dc markets were partially offset by increases in unit closings in the north carolina markets 
sales orders in new jersey and washington dc markets also decreased and as compared to fiscal year the sales orders decrease in the washington dc market can primarily be attributed to a cancellation rate versus in fiscal year discounts as a percentage of revenues in the east region increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million as compared to the year ended march  primarily due to declines in operating earnings in the washington dc and new jersey markets where earnings decreased and  respectively  versus fiscal year the primary factors that led to the decrease in operating earnings in the washington dc and new jersey markets were decreases in housing margins resulting from additional discounts and sales incentives offered in these markets to stimulate sales orders 
in addition  we recorded million of land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs in the washington dc market during fiscal year southeast revenues decreased when compared to fiscal year all markets in the southeast region experienced double digit percentage decreases in revenues except for the nashville and west florida markets 
the decrease in revenues for the southeast region was primarily due to a decrease in closings as compared to fiscal year  offset slightly by a increase in average revenue per unit 
the decrease in closings was the result of a decrease in sales orders versus the year ended march  we experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders in all markets in the southeast region 
the primary factor contributing to the decrease in sales orders was the increase in cancellation rates from in fiscal year to in fiscal year operating earnings for the region decreased million as compared to fiscal year the most pronounced declines in operating earnings were experienced in the southwest and southeast florida markets  which totaled of the decrease 
the decrease in operating earnings in the southeast florida market was partially the result of million in land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs 
central revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in units closed as compared to the year ended march  the indianapolis market was the only market within the central region to experience increases in revenues and closings 
all markets within the central region experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders when compared to fiscal year  with the most pronounced decline in the columbus market at 
despite an increase in discounts from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  average revenue per unit held relatively stable  with only a decrease over the year ended march  operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year the detroit  minnesota and illinois markets combined for a total of of the total decrease in operating earnings 
the decrease in operating earnings in the detroit  minnesota and illinois markets was partially the result of a million increase in land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs 
texas revenues increased as compared to the year ended march  primarily due to revenue increases in the san antonio and central texas markets of and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in the dallas fort worth market 
the increase in revenues was attributable to a increase in average revenue per unit 
all markets within the texas region experienced increases in average revenue per unit with the largest increases in the san antonio and houston markets 
operating earnings increased million as compared to fiscal year the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to an increase in housing margin in all markets in the texas region except for the dallas fort worth market 
northwest revenues decreased as compared to fiscal year double digit percentage decreases in revenues experienced in the reno  denver and sacramento markets were largely offset by double digit percentage increases in the seattle and central valley markets 
closings increased in the northwest region  but were more than offset by an increase in discounts as a percentage of revenues from to in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year the primary contributors to the decrease in operating earnings in the northwest region were a decrease in housing margin and an increase in land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs of million as compared to the year ended march  in addition  we recorded million in our share of joint ventures impairments in the sacramento market in fiscal year hawaii  seattle and portland were the only markets within the northwest region to experience slight to moderate increases in housing margin and operating earnings 
southwest revenues decreased primarily due to an decrease in units closed 
the largest decreases in units closed occurred in the southern california markets  but were partially offset by an increase in units closed in the inland empire market 
overall  average revenue per unit increased for the region despite increases in discounts as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year in addition  sales orders decreased as compared to the year ended march  all markets within the southwest region experienced double digit percentage decreases in sales orders  and cancellation rates have averaged in fiscal year versus in fiscal year operating earnings decreased million when compared to fiscal year all markets within the southwest region experienced decreases in operating earnings with the exception of the new mexico market 
the most significant decreases were experienced in the southern california and las vegas markets 
the decreases in operating earnings in southern california and las vegas markets were attributable to decreases in housing margin and increases in land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs 
land related impairments and land related write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs in our southern california and las vegas markets totaled million 
in addition  we recorded million in our share of joint ventures impairments and our decision to exit one joint venture in the southern california coastal market in fiscal year other homebuilding revenues decreased primarily due to the wind down of our salt lake city and greenville columbia south carolina operations 
total revenues for these two divisions were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues for our resort operations in our texas markets 
operating earnings decreased as additional sales incentives and discounts were used to stimulate sales activity in certain markets 
additionally  a million land related impairment was recorded for one of our projects in the southeast florida market

loan funding costs increased as a result of higher short term interest rates 
this increase in funding costs was the primary factor contributing to the increase in cost of sales and the decrease in net interest income for the year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  was primarily the result of decreases in branch operating  branch support and sales management expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in additions to the loan origination reserve

we believe that separate disclosure of the consolidating information is useful because the financial services subsidiaries and related companies operate in a distinctly different financial environment  and centex has limited obligations with respect to the indebtedness of our financial services subsidiaries and related companies 
management uses this information in its financial and strategic planning 
we also use this presentation to allow investors to compare us to homebuilders that do not have financial services operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  the statements of consolidated cash flows have not been restated for discontinued operations 
as a result  all international homebuilding sold in september  construction services sold in march and home services operations sold in april cash flows are included with the centex cash flows and all home equity sold in july cash flows are included with the financial services cash flows in the table above 
significant components of cash flows from discontinued operations are discussed below 
centex we generally fund our centex operating and other short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  short term borrowings and the issuance of senior debt 
centex s operating cash is derived primarily through home and land sales from our homebuilding operations 
during the year ended march   centex s cash from operating activities was primarily provided by a decrease in inventory  which was partially offset by an increase in taxes receivable and reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
centex s cash used in investing activities during the year ended march  primarily relates to net capital contributions of million made to financial services in order to meet the equity requirements under its committed warehouse facilities and to facilitate the funding of financial services construction loan program  and to a lesser extent  cash contributions to home building joint ventures 
during fiscal year  financial services ceased originating new construction loans 
cash used in centex s financing activities during the year ended march  was primarily for the repayment of million in long term debt 
during fiscal year  centex s cash from operating activities was primarily provided by dividends received from financial services and the net reduction in home building inventories 
included in centex s financing activities for the year ended march  was cash used to fund share repurchases 
in addition  centex s financing activities for the year ended march  included the refinancing of scheduled debt maturities  the repayment of short term borrowings and cash received from option exercises 
during fiscal year  cash was primarily used in centex s operating activities to finance increases in home building inventories relating to the increased level of sales and resulting units under construction during the year  and for the acquisition of land held for development 
the funds provided by centex s financing activities for the year ended march  were primarily from debt issuances 
financial services we generally fund our financial services operating and other short term liquidity needs through committed warehouse facilities  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and cash flows from operations 
financial services operating cash is derived through sales of mortgage loans and origination and servicing fees 
during the year ended march   cash from operations was provided by proceeds from sales of mortgage loans that were not reinvested in new mortgage loans and origination and servicing fees 
these funds were used in financing activities to repay short term and long term debt 
the capital contribution made by centex to financial services described above is also reflected as a financing activity during the year ended march  during fiscal year  cash was provided by sales of mortgage loans and origination and servicing fees  whereas  during fiscal year  cash was used to fund these mortgage loans 
the funds provided by financial services investing activities in fiscal year was primarily related to the cash proceeds received from the sales of home equity and our technology operations 
this was substantially offset by an increase in funding construction loans and home equity s mortgage loans held for investment prior to its sale see further explanation below 
discontinued operations included in centex s operating cash flows for the year ended march  were general contracting fees obtained through our construction services segment 
for the year ended march   cash provided by construction services operating cash flows was million 
additionally  construction services had million in cash and cash equivalents when this business was sold on march  prior to the sale of construction services  cash generated by the operations of construction services was frequently used to finance the operations of our other businesses 
after the sale of construction services  we no longer had access to this source of internal financing 
included in financial services operating cash flows for the year ended march  were funds from securitizations and interest income on mortgage loans held by home equity for investment 
financial services cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was primarily from a reduction in home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
home equity originated mortgage loans with the intent to securitize  however  whole loan sales periodically occurred 
financial services cash used in financing activities in fiscal years and was primarily from the repayment of debt from the liquidation of home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
construction services and home equity did not require significant capital resources nor did they provide significant liquidity 
as a result  our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially impacted by the sale of these operations 
contractual and other obligations our future cash requirements for contractual obligations  excluding discontinued operations  as of march  in thousands are illustrated in the following table payments due by period less than more than year years years years total centex long term debt operating leases joint venture obligations purchase obligations financial services operating leases as outlined above  our primary contractual obligations are principal and interest payments under long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases 
effective april   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
 which we refer to as fin the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin was recorded as a million reduction to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year in accordance with fin  at march   accrued liabilities include million in unrecognized tax benefits  accrued interest and penalties which excludes the tax benefit relating to the deductibility of interest and state income tax 
due to the nature of these liabilities and ongoing examinations by taxing authorities  we are unable to reasonably estimate during which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
for further information regarding fin  see note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our homebuilding operations also have certain obligations under our joint venture arrangements  community district development bonds and other special financing districts 
additionally  financial services has committed to fund certain loans 
see note g  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
we expect to fund our contractual and other obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows  cash on hand and through our credit facilities 
credit facilities and liquidity our existing credit facilities and available capacity as of march  are summarized below dollars in thousands existing credit available facilities capacity centex multi bank revolving credit facility revolving credit letters of credit financial services secured credit facilities this is an unsecured  committed  multi bank revolving credit facility  maturing in july  that serves as funding for general corporate purposes and provides million of letter of credit capacity 
as of march   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility s available capacity is subject to a borrowing base limitation when our senior unsecured debt does not have an investment grade rating from at least two of the following moody s  s p and fitch ratings  which we refer to as fitch 
under the borrowing base limitation  the sum of our net senior debt and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets 
available capacity amounts above reflect the borrowing base limitation 
financial letters of credit reduce the available capacity under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit 
financial letters of credit are generally issued as a form of financial or payment guarantee 
at march   ctx mortgage company  llc maintained million of secured  committed mortgage warehouse facilities 
subsequent to march   existing credit facilities were reduced million to million with a corresponding decrease in available capacity 
see note p  subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our outstanding debt in thousands as of march  was as follows due dates are presented in fiscal years centex short term debt short term note payable senior debt senior notes  weighted average  due through other indebtedness  weighted average  due through financial services short term debt short term notes payable as of march   our short term debt was million  most of which was applicable to financial services 
as of march   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
from time to time  we borrow under our facility for general working capital purposes 
amounts are repaid using cash flows from operations 
we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants in our multi bank revolving credit facility 
in addition  our committed bank warehouse credit facilities contain various affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for facilities of this type 
at march   we were in compliance with all our financial covenants 
we monitor compliance with these covenants on a quarterly basis  including forward looking projections 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal year  substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by ctx mortgage company  llc were funded through the sale of such mortgage loans to hsf i 
hsf i was a variable interest entity of which we were the primary beneficiary  and it was consolidated in our financial statements 
hsf i obtained the funds needed to purchase eligible mortgage loans from ctx mortgage company  llc  by issuing short term secured liquidity notes and other securities 
since the second quarter of fiscal year  hsf i has not been able to issue short term liquidity notes to finance the purchase of mortgage loans from ctx mortgage company  llc as a result of current market conditions affecting the mortgage finance industry 
accordingly  ctx mortgage company  llc discontinued sales of mortgage loans to hsf i 
in november  we terminated hsf i and all of its outstanding obligations were redeemed 
our decision to terminate hsf i was influenced by external market conditions and not by any quality or performance issues related to hsf i or its underlying collateral 
for additional information regarding hsf i and certain related arrangements  see note f  indebtedness  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the unavailability of hsf i as a funding source for ctx mortgage company  llc s mortgage loan originations  ctx mortgage company  llc increased its use of committed bank mortgage warehouse credit facilities 
under one such warehouse credit facility amounting to million at march   the bank had the option to convert the facility to an amortizing loan based on the ultimate sale of the underlying collateral and not to purchase any additional mortgage loans if our long term unsecured debt ratings fell below bb by s p  below bbb by fitch or below ba by moody s 
at march   our long term unsecured debt was rated bb by s p  bbb by fitch and ba by moody s 
on may   s p lowered our debt rating from bb to bb 
this downgrade triggered the provision in the million committed bank warehouse credit facility which allows the bank to convert the facility to an amortizing loan based on the ultimate sale of the underlying collateral and not to purchase any additional mortgage loans 
on may   ctx mortgage company  llc executed an amendment to the bank warehouse credit facility which lowered the commitment to million  reset the debt ratings trigger that provides the bank the option to convert the facility to an amortizing loan if our credit rating falls below bb by s p and fitch  or below ba by moody s 
our long term unsecured debt is currently rated bb by s p  bbb by fitch and ba by moody s 
ctx mortgage company  llc may seek to enter into additional mortgage warehouse facilities with other lenders 
a further downgrade in our credit rating by a rating agency could result in the wind down of the million warehouse credit facility 
the rating change by s p is not currently anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our ability to access the capital we need to fund our operations 
in order to reduce debt and to decrease future cash interest payments  as well as principal payments that are due at maturity or would be required to be made upon redemption  we may  from time to time  repurchase our outstanding debt securities for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
we will evaluate any such transactions in light of market conditions prevailing at the time  taking into account our liquidity  our future debt service requirements and our requirements for future access to capital 
if the current funding sources were to become unavailable  financial services would need to make other financing arrangements to fund its mortgage loan origination activities  or we may be required to fund financial services loan originations and make additional capital contributions to financial services 
although we believe that financial services could broker loans to other mortgage companies  sell loans directly to fnma  or arrange for alternative financing that is common for other homebuilders and mortgage companies  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on satisfactory terms  and any delay in obtaining such financing could adversely affect the results of operations of financial services 
in general  we believe that our existing cash and future sources of funding  cash flow from operations  including anticipated federal tax refunds  and our committed credit facilities are adequate to meet our currently anticipated operating needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
as a supplement to our cash provided by operations  we may elect to sell certain non strategic assets 
there can be no assurance that such sales could be completed on terms or within a timeframe acceptable to us in order to create additional cash flow 
in addition  our future cash flow from operations may vary depending on a number of factors  including market conditions in the homebuilding industry  the availability of financing to homebuyers  the level of competition and general and economic factors beyond our control 
we cannot predict what effect these factors will have on our future liquidity 
for additional information on factors impacting our liquidity and capital resources  please refer to part i  item a  risk factors 
seasonality and inflation we have historically experienced variability in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry 
due to the deteriorating market conditions and our strategic responses to such downturn  we can make no assurances as to whether our historical seasonal pattern will provide guidance as to future results of operations 
periods of high inflation may adversely affect us and the homebuilding industry in general  as it may contribute to higher land  financing  labor and construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates  which may accompany inflation  significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
traditionally  we have attempted to pass increases in our costs to our customers through increased sales prices  however  current market instability may limit our ability to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting our prospective homebuyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
certain off balance sheet obligations the following is a summary of certain off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations and their possible effects on our liquidity and capital resources 
joint ventures we conduct a portion of our land acquisition  development and other activities through our participation in joint ventures in which we hold less than a majority interest 
these land related activities typically require substantial capital  and partnering with other homebuilders or developers and  to a lesser extent  financial partners  allows home building to share the risks and rewards of ownership and to provide broader strategic advantages 
a summary of our home building joint ventures is presented below dollars in thousands as of march  centex s centex s number share number share of jvs investments of debt of jvs investments of debt unleveraged joint ventures joint ventures with debt limited maintenance guarantee repayment guarantee completion guarantee no recourse or guarantee the number of joint ventures includes unconsolidated home building joint ventures for which we have an investment balance as of the end of the period and or current fiscal year activity 
we were the managing member of and of the joint ventures as of march  and  respectively 
the number of joint ventures includes and joint ventures as of march  and  respectively  for which substantially all the joint ventures activities are complete 
these amounts represent our maximum exposure related to the joint ventures debt at each respective date 
we have guaranteed that certain of the joint ventures will maintain a specified loan to value ratio 
for certain joint ventures  we have contributed additional capital in order to maintain loan to value requirements 
at march   we had one remaining joint venture with a limited maintenance guarantee 
in april  this joint venture repaid its outstanding debt 
certain joint venture agreements require us to guarantee the completion of a project or phase if the joint venture does not perform the required land development 
a portion of these completion guarantees are joint and several with our partners 
we have guaranteed repayment of a portion of certain joint venture debt limited to our ownership percentage of the joint venture or a percentage thereof 
total joint venture debt outstanding as of march  and was million and billion  respectively 
debt agreements for joint ventures vary by lender in terms of structure and level of recourse 
for certain of the joint ventures  we are also liable on a contingent basis  through other guarantees  letters of credit or other arrangements  with respect to a portion of the construction debt 
additionally  we have agreed to indemnify the construction lender for certain environmental liabilities in the case of most joint ventures and most guarantee arrangements provide that we are liable for our proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture files for voluntary bankruptcy 
to date  we have not been requested to perform under the environmental liabilities or voluntary bankruptcy guarantees for any of our joint ventures 
four of our joint ventures are in default of their joint venture debt agreements 
in addition  we expect two other joint ventures to be in default of their joint venture debt agreements subsequent to march  our joint venture partner to one of these joint ventures filed for bankruptcy during the year ended march  our share of the total debt of these joint ventures is million and is included in the table above 
we are in discussions with the joint venture partners and lenders with respect to each joint venture and are evaluating alternatives to mitigate our exposure 
we expect to fulfill our contractual obligations under the joint venture agreements 
costs associated with fulfilling such contractual obligations may be less than our share of the joint ventures debt 
recourse under joint venture debt agreements is limited to either the underlying collateral or completion obligations of the joint venture partners 
based upon the terms and debt amounts outstanding for these joint ventures and the terms of the joint venture agreements  we do not believe our exposure related to these joint venture defaults will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
a summary of the estimated maturities of our share of joint ventures debt is provided below dollars in thousands 
we have estimated the debt maturities with the assumption that all payments are first applied to pay down the outstanding debt balances as of march  our share of joint ventures debt for which the joint ventures are in default is included in fiscal year ending in the table below 
for the fiscal years ending march  critical accounting estimates some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  however  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the members of the audit committee of the board of directors 
mortgage loan allowances and related reserve financial services has established a liability for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold based upon  among other things  historical loss rates and current trends in loan originations 
this liability includes losses and settlements associated with certain borrower payment defaults  credit quality issues  or misrepresentations and reflects our judgment of the loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
please refer to note g  commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on this reserve as of march  and financial services also periodically reviews its construction loan commitments for collectibility 
to establish the appropriate allowance  we first classify our construction loans into risk categories 
these categories are based on  among other things  the loan product  the borrower s credit profile  the draw activity on the loan  the loan delinquency rate  and the historical realization on construction loans 
each category of loans is then evaluated for potential credit and market related risks 
the allowance for loans we expect to convert to permanent loans that will be held for sale is based on the estimated market value of the loans 
the allowance for loans we expect to eventually default is based on the credit risk of the loan 
from time to time  financial services will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties under the representations and warranty provisions in our loan sale agreements 
if a repurchased loan is performing  it is classified as a mortgage loan held for sale and will most likely be sold to a third party 
if a repurchased loan is nonperforming  the loan and its related allowance are classified as other mortgage loans 
in addition  financial services will foreclose on certain nonperforming construction loans 
we establish an allowance for loans in foreclosure based on our historical loss experience and current loss trends 
please refer to note b  mortgage loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our other mortgage loans and the related allowance as of march  and if a nonperforming loan becomes current  it is reclassified to mortgage loans held for sale 
on all other nonperforming loans  we proceed to foreclose on the loan 
once we have received title to the underlying collateral  we classify the loan amount  net of its allowance  as real estate owned 
we establish an allowance for real estate owned based upon the estimated value of the property 
real estate owned is reflected as a component of other inventory 
at march  and  real estate owned was million and million  respectively  which were net of allowances of million and million  respectively 
although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and related reserve reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at march  to be adequate  there can be no assurance that these allowances and related reserve will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations 
these allowances and related reserve may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy  the mortgage market  or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers 
inventory valuation land acquisition  land development  and home construction costs include costs incurred land acquisition and development  direct construction  capitalized interest and real estate taxes  as well as certain estimated costs 
these estimated costs include accruals for estimated costs incurred but not yet paid and estimates of remaining costs 
these estimates are based on homebuilding and land development budgets that are assembled from historical experience and local market conditions 
actual results may differ from anticipated costs due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  a change in the length of construction period  a change in cost of construction materials and contractors  and a change in housing demand 
to mitigate these factors  we regularly review and revise our construction budgets and estimates of costs to complete 
on a quarterly basis we assess each neighborhood and land investment  which include housing projects and land held for development and sale  in order to identify underperforming neighborhoods and to identify land investments that may not be recoverable through future operations 
each neighborhood is assessed as an individual project 
this quarterly assessment is an integral part of our local market level processes 
we measure the recoverability of assets by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated future undiscounted net cash flows 
these evaluations are significantly impacted by the following key assumptions related to the project estimates of average future selling prices  estimates of future construction and land development costs  and estimated future sales rates 
these key assumptions are dependent on project specific local market or neighborhood conditions and are inherently uncertain 
local market specific factors that may impact our project assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales rates  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors local market or neighborhood presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other factors are considered by our local personnel as they prepare or update the project level assumptions 
the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated sales price due to increased discounting may result in a complementary increase in sales rates 
based on the results of our assessments  if the carrying amount of the neighborhood exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  an impairment is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the project to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted estimated cash flows for a neighborhood 
discount rates used in our evaluations are based on a risk free interest rate  increased for estimates of market risks associated with a neighborhood 
market risks considered in our discount rate include  among others geographic location of project  product type for example  multifamily high rise product or single family product  average sales price of the product  and estimated project life 
for the quarter ended march   discount rates used in our estimated discounted cash flow assessments ranged from to  with an average discount rate of 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates  which we believe are reasonable  however  if homebuilding market conditions continue to deteriorate  or if the current challenging market conditions continue for an extended period  future results could differ materially from management s judgments and estimates 
land held under option agreements not owned and other land deposits under certain land option agreements with unaffiliated entities  we pay a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land at a future time  usually at predetermined prices 
we evaluate these entities in accordance with the provisions of fin which require us to consolidate the financial results of a variable interest entity if we are its primary beneficiary 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest and or the entity is unable to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the owner or investor that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
we determine if we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity are highly dependent upon our estimates of the variability and probabilities of future land prices and the probabilities of expected cash flows and entitlement risks related to the underlying land  among other factors 
we perform our analysis at the inception of each lot option agreement 
local market personnel are actively involved in our evaluation  including the development of our estimates of expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
to the extent an option agreement is significantly modified or amended  the agreement is reevaluated pursuant to fin based on our evaluation  if we are the primary beneficiary of those entities for which we have entered into land option agreements  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
to the extent financial statements or other information is available  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
if financial statements for the variable interest entity are not available  we record the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase in minority interests 
see note c  inventories  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the results of our analysis of land option agreements 
in addition to land options recorded pursuant to fin  we evaluate land options in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 product financing arrangements 
when our deposits and pre acquisition development costs exceed certain thresholds  or we have determined it is likely we will exercise our option  we record the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase to accrued liabilities 
in addition to the land options recorded pursuant to fin and sfas no 
discussed above  we have other land option deposits for which the underlying asset is not consolidated 
these land option agreements and related pre acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
land option deposits including those consolidated and pre acquisition costs are expensed if the option agreement terminates  is in default  expires by its terms or if we determine it is probable that the property will not be acquired 
on a periodic basis  we assess the probability of acquiring the land we control under option agreements 
this assessment is performed for each option agreement by local market personnel 
the key factors that impact our assessment include local market housing inventory levels for both existing and new homes  our existing local supply of owned and controlled lots  contract purchase price and terms  evaluation of local regulatory environment and  if not fully entitled  likelihood of obtaining required approvals  and local market economic and demographic factors such as job growth  long and short term interest rates  consumer confidence  population growth and immigration 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at january or when management determines that due to certain circumstances the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process with the first step comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized defined as the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill that exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow or market valuation approach 
key assumptions utilized in our discounted cash flow model include estimated future sales levels  estimated costs of sales  varying discount rates and working capital constraints as they principally relate to estimated future inventory levels 
material variations of these assumptions may have a significant impact to the carrying value of goodwill 
for the year ended march   we recorded million in goodwill impairments 
we had no impairments of goodwill for the years ended march  and please refer to note e  goodwill  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill impairments 
warranty accruals home building offers a ten year limited warranty for most homes constructed and sold 
the warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship in the first two years of the home and certain designated components or structural elements of the home in the third through tenth years 
home building estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty program for which it will be responsible and records a liability at the time each home is closed 
factors that affect home building s warranty liability include the number of homes closed  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
home building periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
insurance accruals we have certain self insured retentions and deductible limits under our workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance policies 
we establish reserves for our self insured retentions and deductible limits based on an analysis of historical claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations  among others 
on an annual basis  we engage actuaries to assist in the evaluation and development of claim rates and required reserves for self insurance including reserves related to construction defects and general liability claims 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our insurance accruals and adjust the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
income taxes we account for income taxes on the deferral method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for the tax effect of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we assess  on a quarterly basis  the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance must be established when  based upon the evaluation of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon taxable income in prior carryback years  estimates of future taxable income  tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
sfas provides that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years or losses expected in early future years 
please refer to note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our valuation allowance 
on april   we adopted fin the cumulative effect of the adoption of fin was recorded as a million reduction to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year for further discussion regarding the adoption of fin  please refer to note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  we recognize in our financial statements the impact of tax return positions or future tax positions if it is more likely than not to prevail defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent of being sustained upon audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
prior to the adoption of fin  we applied sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to assess and provide for potential income tax exposures 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we maintained reserves for tax contingencies based on reasonable estimates of the tax liabilities  interest  and penalties if any that may result from tax audits 
fin substantially changes the applicable accounting model and is likely to cause greater volatility in income statements and effective tax rates as more items are recognized and or derecognized discretely within income tax expense 
the federal statute of limitations has expired for our federal tax returns filed for tax years through march  in july  we received a revenue agent s report from the internal revenue service  or irs  relating to the ongoing audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years through we believe that our tax return positions are supported and will vigorously dispute the proposed adjustments 
the irs has commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and the estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits is periodically assessed for adequacy and may be affected by changing interpretations of laws  rulings by tax authorities  certain changes and or developments with respect to audits  and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the outcome for a particular audit cannot be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit and  in some cases  appeal or litigation process 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates 
as each audit is concluded  adjustments  if any  are appropriately recorded in our financial statements 
additionally  in future periods  changes in facts  circumstances  and new information may require us to adjust the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognized in the period in which the change occurs 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  fair value measurements  that serves to define fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective for us as of april  however  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  fas which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
examples of items to which this fsp applies include  but are not limited to  reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test and long lived assets asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment ie inventory impairment assessments 
this fsp defers the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for us to april  we do not expect the adoption of sfas related to financial assets and financial liabilities to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas related to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
under the provisions of sfas  companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments  warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable some companies to reduce the volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently  and it is simpler than using the complex hedge accounting requirements in fasb statement no 
 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to achieve similar results 
sfas will be effective for us as of april  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings 
sab required that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that were accounted for at fair value through earnings 
the provisions of sab were applicable to written loan commitments issued or modified beginning january  we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
under the provisions of sfas  a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  or minority interest  must be classified as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the minority interest must be clearly identified in the statement of consolidated earnings 
sfas also requires consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling interest retained in a deconsolidation 
sfas will be effective for us as of april  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our direct debt obligations and mortgage loans receivable 
we utilize derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage the outstanding debt that is subject to changes in interest rates 
we utilize forward sale commitments to mitigate the risk associated with the majority of our mortgage loan portfolio 
other than the forward commitments and interest rate swaps discussed earlier  we do not utilize forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of march  centex we use both short term and long term debt in our financing strategy 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any of our fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we refinance such debt 
as of march   short term debt was million  most of which was applicable to financial services 
financial services debt is collateralized by mortgage loans 
we borrow on a short term basis under our committed revolving credit facility at prevailing market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding at march  was 
the maturities of centex s long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
the maturities of centex s long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate centex represents a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
financial services financial services enters into interest rate lock commitments  or irlcs  with its customers under which it agrees to make mortgage loans at agreed upon rates within a period of time  generally from one to days  if certain conditions are met 
initially  the irlcs are treated as derivative instruments and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
the fair value of these loan commitment derivatives includes future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan  but does not include the value of any internally developed intangible assets 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the irlcs are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to offset the interest rate risk related to its irlcs  financial services executes forward trade commitments 
certain forward trade commitments are not designated as hedges under sfas and are derivative instruments 
their initial fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these forward trade commitments are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
financial services enters into certain forward trade commitments designated as fair value hedges to hedge the interest rate risk related to its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the forward trade commitments and the mortgage loans  for which the hedge relationship is deemed effective  are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to the extent the hedge is effective  gains or losses in the value of the hedged loans due to interest rate movement will be offset by an equal and opposite gain or loss in the value of the forward trade commitment 
this will result in no impact to earnings 
to the extent the hedge contains some ineffectiveness  the ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings
