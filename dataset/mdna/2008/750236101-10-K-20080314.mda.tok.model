business summary overview our business segments are mortgage insurance  financial guaranty and financial services 
the following table shows the percentage of our equity allocated to each business segment at december  equity mortgage insurance financial guaranty financial services mortgage insurance our mortgage insurance segment provides credit related insurance coverage  principally through private mortgage insurance  and risk management services to mortgage lending institutions located throughout the us and select countries outside the us we provide these products and services primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries  radian guaranty inc  amerin guaranty corporation  and radian insurance inc which we refer to as radian guaranty  amerin guaranty  and radian insurance  respectively 
private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders from all or a portion of default related losses on residential mortgage loans made mostly to home buyers who make down payments of less than of the home s purchase price 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market  most of which are sold to freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we sometimes refer to freddie mac and fannie mae as government sponsored enterprises or gses 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our mortgage insurance segment  through radian guaranty  offers primary and pool mortgage insurance coverage on residential first lien mortgages 
at december   primary insurance on domestic first lien mortgages made up approximately of our total domestic first lien mortgage insurance risk in force  and pool insurance on domestic first lien mortgages made up approximately of our total domestic first lien mortgage insurance risk in force 

table of contents non traditional mortgage credit enhancement 
we used radian insurance to provide credit enhancement for mortgage related capital market transactions and to write credit insurance on mortgage related assets  including net interest margin securities nims  international insurance and reinsurance transactions  second lien mortgages  home equity loans and credit default swaps collectively  we refer to the risk associated with these transactions as other risk 
we also insured second lien mortgages through amerin guaranty 
we are no longer writing insurance on nims  second lien mortgages or credit default swap business 
international mortgage insurance 
we recently cancelled the authorization of radian europe limited radian europe to engage in the business of insurance in the united kingdom and other european union member states 
no business had been written by radian europe 
the capital held by radian europe was distributed back to radian guaranty in the fourth quarter of we have written our existing international mortgage insurance business through radian insurance 
on february   s p downgraded radian insurance from aa to a 
radian insurance had eight active international transactions at the time of the s p downgrade 
of these transactions  five have early termination clauses that were triggered as a result of the downgrade which allow our counterparties to terminate these transactions 
on march   standard chartered bank in hong kong informed us that they wished to terminate their contract with radian insurance  effective immediately 
while we still are in the process of assessing the validity of the notice and the potential impact of termination  there is a possibility that radian insurance could be required to return to standard chartered bank  or to transfer to another insurer  unearned premium related to this transaction 
unless extended  this transaction was expected to expire at the end of if the remaining four transactions also are terminated  we could be required to return or transfer to another insurer additional unearned premiums 
we believe the s p downgrade will make it difficult for us to continue to write international mortgage insurance business through radian insurance  and we are in the process of exploring other alternatives for writing such business

raal accounted for million or of financial guaranty s direct premiums written in  compared to million or of financial guaranty s direct premiums written in financial services our financial services segment includes the credit based businesses conducted through our affiliates  credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass and sherman financial group llc sherman 
we currently hold a equity interest in c bass and a equity interest in sherman 
c bass c bass is an unconsolidated  less than owned investment that is not controlled by us 
we and mgic investment corporation mgic each own of c bass  with the remaining interests owned by the management of c bass 
historically  c bass has been principally engaged as a mortgage investment and servicing company specializing in the credit risk of subprime single family residential mortgages 
beginning in february and continuing through approximately the end of march  the subprime mortgage market experienced significant turmoil 
after a period of relative stability that persisted during april  may and through approximately late june  market dislocations recurred and then accelerated to unprecedented levels beginning in approximately mid july during the five month period from february  through june   c bass s financial statements included the payment of approximately million to satisfy lenders margin calls on loans to c bass  which it handled with its available liquidity 
third quarter impairment 
during the third quarter there were several events that significantly impacted c bass 
those events included the following on july   c bass completed its acquisition of fieldstone investment corporation fieldstone  a mortgage banking company that originated  sold  and invested primarily in non conforming single family residential mortgage loans  for approximately million  including closing costs 
c bass used approximately million in cash to fund this acquisition 
on july   in order to support c bass s liquidity position  we and mgic  each entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with c bass that is payable on demand and was scheduled to expire december  on july and   c bass drew down the entire million on each facility million in total 
on july and   c bass received approximately million in margin calls bringing the total margin calls for the month to million 
as of the close of business on july th  c bass had paid only million of the million in outstanding margin calls 
as a result of margin calls from lenders that c bass had not been able to meet  c bass s purchases of mortgages and mortgage securities and its securitization activities ceased 
prior to july   a number of qualified buyers showed a strong interest in c bass  and both we and mgic received multiple preliminary indications of interest above c bass s book value 
due diligence was ongoing until july  when the increase in margin calls over the prior few days significantly jeopardized c bass s liquidity position  resulting in a withdrawal of all interested buyers at that time 

table of contents on july   we concluded that there were indicators that a material charge for impairment of our investment in c bass was required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  however  we could not determine the amount  or range of amounts  of the potential impairment until financial information was received from c bass 
in november  we received financial statements from c bass as of september   at which point we made a final determination with respect to impairment 
on july   in accordance with the terms of our credit facility with c bass  we demanded full and immediate payment of all amounts owed to us under the credit facility 
this amount currently remains outstanding 
amounts drawn under this facility bear interest at a rate of one month london interbank offered rate libor at the date the amount is drawn plus 
if the loan is called for payment  but remains unpaid as currently is the case  the facility bears interest at libor plus 
in addition  a facility fee is payable to us and mgic 
sale of litton loan servicing lp litton 
since july   with the cooperation of its lenders  including us and mgic  c bass has been working with its financial advisor and potential investors  to evaluate strategic alternatives for securing additional liquidity 
as a result of that process  on september   c bass agreed to sell to goldman sachs substantially all of its interest in litton for approximately million in order to avoid bankruptcy 
as a condition to this sale  on november   the c bass employees  lenders and creditors  including us  entered into an agreement the override agreement establishing i the terms for the distribution of the consideration from the sale  among all interested parties and ii an agreement among the outstanding lenders and creditors to continue to forebear from exercising any recourse rights under their existing obligations with c bass 
there are certain agreements and covenants contained in the override agreement and to the extent c bass were to breach one of those agreements or covenants  c bass may have to seek bankruptcy protection 
in december  c bass completed the sale of litton to goldman sachs 
in connection with this sale  goldman sachs also paid a nominal amount for the option to purchase from the current owners of c bass  including us  of the equity of c bass for approximately million 
we estimated that this option had a fair value of at december  we account for our investment in c bass under the equity method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb opinion no 

during the third quarter of  c bass incurred a loss of million and in accordance with apb opinion no 
 we recognized our portion of losses of approximately million 
this resulted in a reduction in our equity investment in c bass from million to million at september  in addition to the recognition of losses  we completed an impairment analysis which resulted in the charge off of the remaining carrying value of million in the equity investment in c bass at september  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting by an equity method investor for investee losses when the investor has loans to and investments in other securities of the investee eitf no 
 requires that when the recognition of equity losses reduces our equity investment to zero  we should continue to report our share of equity method losses in our income statement and should apply those equity method losses to our other investments in or loans to c bass 
during the fourth quarter  operating results at c bass were negative due to a continuation of valuation reductions in their whole loan and securities portfolio 
as a result of the additional losses at c bass  and continued application of apb opinion no 
and eitf no 
 we recorded a full write off of our million credit facility as of december  the ultimate collectibility of this facility is uncertain 
sherman sherman is a consumer asset and servicing firm specializing in charged off and bankruptcy plan consumer assets that it generally purchases at deep discounts from national financial institutions and major retail 
table of contents corporations and subsequently seeks to collect 
in addition  sherman originates credit card receivables through its subsidiary creditone and has a variety of other similar ventures related to consumer assets 
on september   we sold to sherman capital  llc sherman capital  an entity owned by the management of sherman all of our preferred interests in sherman and  class a common units in sherman  representing approximately of our total common interests in sherman  for a cash purchase price of approximately million  plus a future contingent payment 
the amount of the contingent payment  if any  will depend on the extent that sherman capital s after tax return on  of the class a common units acquired in the transaction exceeds approximately annually 
the contingent payment is payable to us on december  or earlier upon the closing of a sale of sherman 
we recorded a gain of million on the sale of our interest in sherman 
on september   in connection with the sale of a portion of our equity interests in sherman  we entered into an option agreement with meeting street investments llc ms llc  an entity owned by sherman s management 
under the option agreement  we granted to ms llc an irrevocable option the call option to require us to sell to ms llc all of our remaining interests in sherman at any time during the one year period following september  the purchase price under the call option  if exercised  will be equal to the product of a our ownership percentage in sherman as of the date of sale under the option agreement and b billion  minus of all future distributions made by sherman with respect to our remaining interests in sherman through the date of sale under the option agreement 
we estimated that this call option had a fair value of at december  termination of merger with mgic investment corporation mgic on february   we and mgic entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which we agreed  subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement  to merge with and into mgic  with the combined company to be re named mgic radian financial group inc on september   facing market conditions that had made combining the companies significantly more challenging  we and mgic entered into a termination and release agreement relating to the agreement and plan of merger 
as a result of this agreement  we and mgic terminated the agreement and plan of merger  abandoned the merger contemplated by the merger agreement and released each other from related claims 
neither party made a payment to the other in connection with the termination 
overview of business results as a holder of credit risk  our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the production environment and credit performance of our underlying insured assets 
the current mortgage cycle  characterized by declining home prices in certain markets  deteriorating credit performance of mortgage assets particularly alternative a alt a and subprime and reduced liquidity for many participants in the mortgage industry  has had  and we believe will continue to have  a significant impact on the results of operations for each of our business segments 
mortgage insurance during  the current housing and credit cycle resulted in significant losses in our traditional mortgage insurance business  as well as in certain non traditional mortgage insurance products nims  second lien mortgages and mortgage backed securities that we insure 
traditional mortgage insurance 
our traditional mortgage insurance business experienced increasingly poor financial results during the second half of we experienced an accelerating trend of higher delinquencies in 
table of contents the second half of  primarily driven by the poor performance of the late through vintage books of business  a lack of refinance capacity in the current mortgage market  which has been forcing many borrowers  in particular those with adjustable rate mortgages arms  into default  and from home price depreciation in many parts of the us while losses generally have increased across all mortgage insurance product lines  a disproportionate percentage of our increased losses are attributable to alt a mortgages 
markets in california and florida  where the alt a product and arms are prevalent  continue to have a significant negative impact on our mortgage insurance business results 
approximately of the total increase in our mortgage insurance loss reserves during was attributable to these states  which together represent approximately of our mortgage insurance risk in force 
in addition to the increase in new delinquencies during  our mortgage insurance loss provision at december   when compared to december   was negatively impacted by higher loan balances on delinquent loans  higher rates of delinquencies moving into claim status referred to as the claim rate  a decrease in the cure rate of defaults and an increase in claims paid 
during  an increase in both the claim rate and the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim referred to as claim severity resulted in incremental increases in our mortgage insurance loss reserves throughout the year 
in addition  we refined our loss reserving methodology in the fourth quarter of to assume that the deteriorating trends in mortgage insurance claim rates will continue for the next three successive quarters 
we believe this assumption is necessary to further align our claim rate expectations with our expectations for continuing home price depreciation  a lack of available credit for many borrowers seeking to refinance and a deficiency in underwriting standards on a portion of the through vintage mortgage production  each of which will make it more likely that existing defaults will ultimately result in a claim 
this change increased our loss reserves for first lien mortgages by an additional million in the fourth quarter of we expect to pay total mortgage insurance claims including second liens of approximately million in the first quarter of and approximately billion in total in while we and the mortgage lenders have recently tightened our underwriting guidelines considerably  the early performance of business written in and much of has been poor  providing early evidence that this business will likely be unprofitable 
until these books of business have sufficiently seasoned  we expect to continue to experience poor results in our traditional mortgage insurance business 
these results have been  and will likely continue to be  exacerbated by the deteriorating domestic housing market that has existed throughout and is predicted to continue into and possibly beyond 
it is likely that ultimate losses on our traditional mortgage insurance portfolio will continue to be driven mainly by declining home prices over the next three years in most of the us in light of continuing declines  we expect incurred losses from our traditional mortgage insurance portfolio will be over of earned premiums in beyond  given the current uncertainty in the credit and housing markets and the overall economy  we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what our ultimate losses on our traditional mortgage insurance portfolio will be 
we have reviewed a number of stress scenarios that we believe are potentially reasonable  and in each of these cases we believe that our claims paying resources will be sufficient 
in some of these scenarios  however  we may require additional capital  if not to support our capital position or ratings  then to ensure greater market confidence among our lending customers and others 
in response to current market conditions  we implemented changes to our underwriting criteria in the fourth quarter of  and we are in the process of adjusting our pricing to improve our risk reward posture and to generate appropriate returns on new business 
the most important change to our underwriting criteria is the adoption of a declining market policy in which we reduce the maximum loan to value ltv that we will insure by in any region of the us that experiences a decline in value based on the most recent data produced by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight 
based on this recent data  approximately of the us is experiencing declines and we are correspondingly reducing risk by reducing our maximum ltvs in these areas 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we made significant changes to our alt a guidelines by restricting our exposure to various combinations of reduced documentation and high ltv loans 
although others in the 
table of contents industry have announced similar changes to pricing and underwriting standards  it is possible that our underwriting and pricing changes may negatively affect our business volume  growth of new insurance written and insurance in force 
however  we believe these changes are necessary to improve our risk profile  and we have begun to see improvement in our fourth quarter mix of business as a result of these changes  our corporate wide focus on prime business and the industry wide shift to higher quality credit 
we have protected against some of the losses that may occur in excess of our expectations on some of the risk associated with non prime and riskier products by reinsuring it through smart home transactions 
in  we developed smart home as a way to effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
smart home mitigates our risk against catastrophic loss in extremely adverse conditions  concentrated positions and riskier products such as subprime mortgages 
approximately and of our primary mortgage insurance risk in force was included in smart home arrangements at december  and  respectively 
in these transactions  we reinsure the middle layer risk positions  while retaining a significant portion of the total risk comprising the first loss and most remote risk positions 
since august  we have completed four smart home arrangements 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million ceded premiums written for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  related to the smart home transactions 
ceded premiums earned for  and were million  million and million  respectively  related to the smart home transactions 
ceded losses in were million as a result of the smart home transactions 
there were no ceded losses in or in addition to smart home  we transfer a substantial portion of the risk we write on loans originated by certain lender customers to captive reinsurance companies affiliated with such lender customers 
we had approximately active captive reinsurance agreements in place at december  as of december   approximately of our primary risk in force was subject to captive reinsurance 
this percentage can be volatile as a result of increases or decreases in the volume of structured transactions  which are not typically eligible for captive reinsurance arrangements 
although the amount of losses we expect to incur in our mortgage insurance business is uncertain at this point  in most reasonable stress scenarios  we would expect to receive significant reinsurance recoveries from smart home and captive reinsurance  beginning in despite our poor operating results for the year  we are encouraged by recent positive trends in the mortgage insurance market 
market turmoil has led to a tightening of our customers mortgage underwriting standards  which should result in better performing books of mostly prime business in the future 
we also are seeing a continued increased demand for our traditional mortgage insurance product as alternative products  such as mortgages  which were a common alternative to mortgage insurance in and  have declined significantly due to higher interest rates and diminished liquidity available in the origination and secondary markets for these products 
we also believe that the private mortgage insurance market has benefited from the tax deductibility for eligible borrowers of mortgage insurance premiums and an increase in the number of low down payment mortgage loans purchased by the gses 
as a result of these positive trends  our primary new insurance written increased by in compared to this increase reflects a increase in new insurance written generated by our traditional flow business 
the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on our books after any month period was for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the 
table of contents twelve months ended december  this increase was due to a decline in refinancing activity from the high levels in and  mainly due to home price depreciation  tighter underwriting standards and an overall decrease in the lending capacity among mortgage originators 
the persistency rate for structured products during the twelve months ended december  was compared to for our flow business 
we expect that persistency rates will continue to remain at elevated levels for as long as the current disruption in the housing and mortgage credit markets continues to persist 
nims 
the million of risk in force associated with nims at december   representing of our total risk in force  comprises deals with an average notional balance of million million at origination and a total notional balance of million 
the average expiration of our existing nims transactions is approximately two years 
in the fourth quarter of  as a risk mitigation initiative  we purchased  at a discount to par  some of the nims bonds that we insure  thereby contributing to the reduction in our overall risk on nims 
in  we have continued to purchase the nims bonds that we have insured in instances where we believe the repurchase may reduce our ultimate loss 
the loans underlying the nims bonds that we insure began to show significant deterioration toward the end of the second quarter of  leading to more delinquencies occurring earlier than we had expected 
these loans have continued to deteriorate throughout nims are subject to derivative accounting and as a result  at december   we have a cumulative unrealized loss of approximately million related to nims bonds 
of this amount  approximately million represents the present value of our total expected principal credit losses related to nims bonds 
as of december   we have paid only million in claims related to nims  and expect to pay the majority of the expected claims beginning in we ceased writing new nims business during the second quarter of and do not anticipate writing nims business in the future as we implement a business model focused primarily on traditional mortgage insurance 
second lien mortgages 
in addition to insuring first lien mortgages  to a lesser extent  we also provided primary or modified pool insurance on second lien mortgages second liens 
the second lien products have been especially susceptible to the disruption in the housing market and the subprime mortgage market 
in the first quarter of  we significantly reduced the amount of new second liens business written in a first loss position 
in the first quarter of  we ceased writing new second lien business of any kind  and have no intention of writing second lien business in the future 
as of december   our total exposure to second liens was approximately million or approximately of our total mortgage insurance risk in force 
of our total exposure to second liens  approximately represents a seasoned segment of our portfolio comprising transactions written in or earlier  generally with prime collateral or in which we are in a second loss position 
as a whole  this portion of our second lien portfolio continues to perform generally within our expectations 
the remaining of our total exposure to second liens relates to two groups of transactions that have been particularly affected by the disruption in the subprime market 
we expect that a significant portion of our total future losses with respect to second liens will come from these two groups of transactions 
the first of these groups  representing approximately million of exposure or of our total exposure to second liens  comprises two structured transactions entered into in late and early claims paid during have included a significant number of claims from the first of these transactions  covering the first of aggregate losses on a pool of subprime second lien mortgages 
we split losses with our counterparty under this transaction on a basis 
as discussed in prior quarters  we began experiencing a significant increase in filed claims from this transaction during the third quarter of and have paid approximately million in net claims on this transaction as of december  at december   our net exposure remaining under this transaction was million or approximately half of the million in gross remaining exposure 
in addition to this transaction  we also have a supplemental policy on the same pool of mortgages that covers certain losses in excess of the aggregate stop loss 
based on delinquency and loss patterns to date  we currently expect cumulative losses on the entire pool of mortgages covered by these two transactions to be 
table of contents over  resulting in future losses to us of approximately million 
we are working with our counterparty to attempt to satisfy all claims issues in a fair way that mitigates overall losses as much as possible 
the second of the two groups  representing approximately million of exposure or of our total exposure to second liens  comprises a series of transactions entered into in the second half of and early our risk under these transactions represents of cumulative losses  attaching at of cumulative losses and detaching at of cumulative losses 
although our cumulative losses related to this transaction were minimal at december   the early delinquency and third party claim patterns for this transaction have been far worse than our initial expectations 
as a result  we currently assume that the cumulative losses related to this transaction will exceed our exposure limit  resulting in future losses to us equal to our total exposure of approximately million 
we expect that our second lien book of business will be almost entirely paid down by as a result  we expect that much of the approximate million in projected future losses resulting from this product will be incurred over that time period 
against these losses  we expect to earn an additional million in premiums over the remaining life of the portfolio 
losses in our second lien portfolio are particularly sensitive to changes in home prices  and therefore  we cannot be certain that actual losses in our second lien portfolio will not differ materially from our projections 
although losses with respect to our second lien business  much like in our traditional first lien mortgage insurance business  will be incurred and paid over time as delinquencies develop and claims are filed  the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses above expected future premiums and existing reserves on the second lien business has been recorded in as a million premium deficiency reserve 
the accounting principle governing this is discussed below in critical accounting policies reserve for losses 
credit default swaps 
in our mortgage insurance business  we sell protection on residential mortgage backed securities rmbs through credit default swaps both domestically and internationally 
in  few attractive opportunities were available to write this business both before and following the disruption in the mortgage credit markets 
as a result  we did not write any new credit protection on rmbs in credit default swap form in  compared to million in notional value written in as of december   our total exposure to domestic credit default swaps on rmbs was million 
these exposures were rated between a and bbb at origination  and were written between may and january  with most of the exposure originated in credit default swaps in our mortgage insurance business are subject to derivative accounting  requiring determinations of gain or loss of the fair value of such derivative instruments 
as of december   we had incurred a cumulative unrealized loss for these transactions of approximately million 
of the million of risk in force  based on an observation of performance to date  we expect to ultimately incur credit losses of approximately million  and could incur an additional million 
we do not believe that we will ultimately have credit losses on the remaining million of the million in exposure 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote billion in notional value of credit protection in credit default swap form on two large aaa tranches of mortgage backed securities  one in germany and one in denmark 
as of december   we had incurred an approximate million cumulative unrealized loss on these transactions 
despite the large notional exposure to this business  our remaining subordination for these transactions is substantial  and we do not currently foresee any reasonable scenario under which we would be liable for credit losses with respect to such exposures 
with respect to one of these transactions  which has been outstanding almost five years  has incurred aggregate losses as of december  of approximately  and has a weighted average ltv of  we would not be liable for paying losses until cumulative losses reached 
with respect to the second transaction  which has been outstanding over three years  has incurred aggregate losses as of december  of 
and has a weighted average ltv of  we would not be liable for paying losses until cumulative losses reached 
in both of these transactions  our attachment point for losses remains over ten times current expected losses 

table of contents financial guaranty presented a difficult business production environment for the financial guaranty industry and radian asset assurance in particular 
due to losses incurred by several of our financial guarantor competitors on their rmbs  cdos of asset backed securities and other credit positions  uncertainty as to the extent of future losses among all financial guarantors  including us  and perceived instability in the franchise values and ratings of many of the financial guarantors  credit spreads for all financial guarantors  including us  have widened significantly 
this resulted in a material reduction in the financial benefit that our credit protection provides to issuers of both public and structured finance transactions that we insure and a reduced perceived benefit to holders of insured debt from the financial guaranty insurance we provide 
many transactions that would normally have been marketed with some form of financial guaranty insurance protection are either not going to market or are being sold without the benefit of financial guaranty insurance 
as a result  there is significant reduction in the volume of transactions for which financial guaranty insurance is a viable option  which makes it more difficult for us to write new business in the current credit environment  and reduces the volume of transactions written by companies that cede business to us 
the widening of credit spreads during resulted in a loss in the fair value of derivative instruments in our financial guaranty business of approximately million  million of which is related to our synthetic corporate cdo exposure 
we believe the portion of this mark related to our synthetic corporate cdo exposure is almost entirely spread driven and does not represent material deterioration in the credit quality of such portion of our insured financial guaranty portfolio or the erosion of the underlying collateral 
as a result  provided that the credit quality of this business remains strong  this loss in fair value should reverse over time as the transactions mature or sooner if credit spreads tighten 
of the remaining million of market value losses  million is attributed to our exposure to cdo subprime rmbs and cdo cmbs as discussed in more detail below 
despite the difficult business environment  there have been limited  selective opportunities in the direct public finance and structured products markets 
in addition  despite the difficult operating environment  we experienced strong growth in both facultative and treaty reinsurance business during the overall credit performance of our financial guaranty portfolio showed some deterioration  but remained strong during given market conditions 
we established a million allocated non specific reserve for the one direct market value transaction remaining in our financial guaranty portfolio during this credit is discussed below under cdo subprime rmbs exposure and in detail below under results of operations financial guaranty year ended december  compared to year ended december  provision for losses 
in addition  we increased our allocated non specific reserve for asset backed rmbs transactions that we insure  representing million in aggregate par outstanding  by an aggregate million due to performance deterioration of these transactions 
our financial guaranty business has exposure to rmbs and cmbs 
we retain this exposure through our insurance of cdos that include asset classes of rmbs or cmbs referred to as cdo rmbs and cdo cmbs and through our insurance of asset backed securities of rmbs outside of cdos referred to as non cdo rmbs 
we do not have any exposure to cmbs outside of cdos that we insure 
our exposure to rmbs and cmbs is both through our direct insurance and through our reinsurance of business assumed from other financial guarantors 
non cdo rmbs exposure 
at december   our insured financial guaranty portfolio included approximately billion of net par outstanding related to non cdo rmbs 
our exposure to non cdo rmbs is spread among transactions and represents of financial guaranty s total net par outstanding as of december

historically  relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
claim activity on prime loans has historically reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination  and on non prime loans this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
based on these trends  approximately of our primary risk in force and approximately of our pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years

as a result of this termination  we had a million gain in the fair value of derivative instruments in see discussion below in provision for losses for our policy on intensified surveillance credits

that was fully reserved for in we expect that losses related to this transaction will continue to be paid out over the next few years 
we closely monitor our financial guaranty obligations and we use an internal classification process to identify and track troubled credits 
we classify credits as intensified surveillance credits when we determine that continued performance is questionable and  in the absence of a positive change  may result in a claim 
at december   and  the financial guaranty segment had the following exposure on credits classified as intensified surveillance credits december december december of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding of credits par outstanding in millions less than greater than total we established loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts as discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for losses in this item and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have allocated non specific reserves of million on intensified surveillance credits representing an aggregate par amount of million at december   compared to million on three credits at december  and million on one credit at december  we established an allocated non specific reserve of million during each of the last two quarters of million in total  representing our total exposure related to a bbb rated credit in which we provide market value and credit support for an extendable commercial paper program 
this program is supported by abs  including rmbs collateral 
on october   the principal placement agent for this program advised us that the commercial paper was not purchased at its most recent roll date 
as a result  the commercial paper extended by its terms for six months during which time the underlying assets must be liquidated to repay the paper 
as a result of ongoing deterioration in the abs markets  the sale of these assets have not been sufficient to repay the maturing commercial paper and total losses have exceeded our exposure to this credit 
we began 
table of contents paying claims on this credit in january and have paid claims equal to our total exposure of million on this transaction 
this credit represents the only direct market value transaction remaining in our financial guaranty portfolio 
there is one credit at december  for which we have not allocated a specific reserve that  without a positive change  may default in the near term and could potentially result in a claim 
based on currently available information  we expect that any claim from this credit  should one arise  would range from a minimal amount up to slightly above of the million in total par outstanding 
the potential amount of any claim is not estimable at this point  in part  because of the availability of a number of strategic alternatives currently under consideration and other mitigating factors that could reduce or delay any payment from us 
in addition  remediation efforts have added substantial additional collateral security for the insured obligation  which could reduce the amount of any claim we may be required to pay 
we continue to collect and analyze additional information regarding that transaction 
there were no direct derivative financial guaranty contracts with million or greater in exposure identified as an intensified surveillance credit at december  or two of the six intensified surveillance credits with million or greater in exposure identified at december  were derivative financial guaranty contracts 
one of these credits  representing million in exposure  was terminated in march  the second credit expired in november  without claim 
in accordance with gaap  we do not establish loss reserves on our derivative financial guaranty contracts 
instead  gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models that take into account both credit and market spreads

while application of the new model resulted in minimal changes for most of our derivative transactions  one high yield synthetic obligation showed a large difference due to greater spread volatility in the high yield corporate names included in this transaction

the obligations of both parties are unconditional and irrevocable  however  no payments may be made without prior approval by the insurance department of the payor s state of domicile  pennsylvania for radian guaranty and illinois for amerin guaranty 
radian guaranty has agreed to maintain radian insurance s tangible net worth at a minimum of million and to cause radian insurance at all times to have sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations  pursuant to a net worth and liquidity maintenance agreement between the two companies

funding of rabbi trusts 
under our change of control agreements with our executive officers  upon a change of control of radian group inc or radian asset assurance  as the case may be  we are required to fund an irrevocable rabbi trust to the extent of our obligations under these agreements 
the total maximum amount that we would be required to place in trust is approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as a provider of credit enhancement  in the normal course of business  we enter into arrangements with special purpose entities spes 
spes are corporations  trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose 
spes  by their nature  are generally not controlled by their equity owners  as the establishing documents generally govern all material decisions 
there are two different accounting frameworks applicable to spes the qualifying spe qspe framework under sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  sfas no 
and the variable interest entity vie framework as provided by fin no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities  fin no 
r 
the applicable framework depends on the nature of the entity and our relation to that entity 
the qspe framework is applicable when an entity transfers sells financial assets to an spe meeting certain criteria defined in sfas these criteria are designed to ensure that the activities of the entity are essentially predetermined at the inception of the vehicle and that the transferor of the financial assets cannot exercise control over the entity and the assets therein 
entities meeting these criteria are not consolidated by the transferor  or other counterparties  as long as they do not have the unilateral ability to liquidate or to cause the entity to no longer meet the qspe criteria 
our interests in qspes may be accounted for as insurance contracts or financial guaranty derivatives 
for insurance contracts with qspes  we record reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  and for derivative interests in qspes  we record changes in the fair value as a corresponding asset or liability 
we do not record the underlying assets or liabilities of qspes on our balance sheet 
when an spe does not meet the qspe criteria  consolidation is assessed pursuant to fin no 
r 
under fin no 
r  a vie is defined as an entity that lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity s operations  and or has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb the entity s losses or the right to receive the entity s returns 
fin no 
r requires a variable interest holder ie  a counterparty to a vie to consolidate the vie if that party will receive the majority of the expected residual returns of the vie  absorb a majority of the expected losses of the vie  or both 
this party is considered the primary beneficiary 
spes and vies are a significant part of our non traditional mortgage insurance products as well as our financial guaranty business 
our primary involvement with spes relates to transactions in which we provide a financial guaranty to one or more classes of beneficial interest holders in the spe 
underlying collateral in the spes includes residential and commercial mortgages  consumer receivables  securities and other financial assets sold to a spe and repackaged into securities or similar beneficial interests 
spes may also be used to create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors and as a means of transferring risk  such as our smart home transactions 
we consolidate those vies in which we are the primary beneficiary 
see note  variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of vies 
for additional information regarding 
table of contents exposure to our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty products see business mortgage insurance and business financial guaranty sections detailed in item of part i of this report 
certain other spes do not meet the requirements of a qspe  because all their activities are not sufficiently limited or they have entered into certain non qualifying transactions 
in some circumstances  a qspe may not be exempt from consolidation if we have the unilateral ability to make significant changes to the qspe 
we follow the criteria under fin no 
r in determining whether we should consolidate such entities 
a determination of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity is initially made at the time we become involved with the entity 
in those instances where we are the primary beneficiary  the assets and liabilities of the vie are consolidated on our balance sheet 
certain reconsideration events may occur which cause us to re assess our initial determination of whether an entity is a vie or non vie 
if the entity becomes a vie  we perform an assessment of consolidation of that entity 
those reconsideration events generally are the entity s governance structure is changed such that either the characteristics or adequacy of equity at risk are changed  or expected returns or losses are reallocated among the participating parties within the entity 
the equity investment or some part thereof is returned to the equity investors and other interests become exposed to expected returns or losses 
additional activities are undertaken or assets acquired by the entity that were beyond those anticipated previously 
participants in the entity acquire or sell interests in the entity 
the entity receives additional equity at risk or curtails its activities in a way that changes the expected returns or losses 
mortgage insurance nims we provided credit enhancement on nims bonds 
a nims bond represents the securitization of a portion of the excess cash flow and prepayment penalties from a mortgage backed security comprised mostly of subprime mortgages 
the majority of this excess cash flow consists of the spread between the interest rate on the mortgage backed security and the interest generated from the underlying mortgage collateral 
historically  issuers of mortgage backed securities would have earned this excess interest over time as the collateral aged  but market efficiencies enabled these issuers to sell a portion of their residual interests to investors in the form of nims bonds 
typically  the issuer retained a significant portion of the residual interests  which was subordinated to the nims bond in a first loss position  so that the issuer would suffer losses associated with any shortfalls in residual cash flows before the nims bond experienced any losses 
nims bonds have largely been susceptible to the disruption in the housing market and the subprime mortgage market during see overview of business results mortgage insurance nims for information regarding our total loss expectations with respect to nims 
our nims are generally structured as qspes 
there are certain circumstances and triggers outside of our control  however  that would give us the ability to call some or all of the outstanding nims bonds 
the effective control that we attain if the call option is triggered  renders the qspe a vie under fin no 
r 
we then assess whether we are required to consolidate the vie 
at december   there were six such transactions that required consolidation  but such consolidation had an immaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of our exposure to the nims underlying trust assets at december  in millions vie assets total exposure amount subordination below our exposure average rating of collateral at inception nims exposure nims bbb to bb includes approximately million of consolidated nims assets 

table of contents smart home in  we developed a program referred to as smart home  for reinsuring risk associated with non prime mortgages and riskier products 
these arrangements  through the use of spe structures  effectively transfer risk from our portfolio to investors in the capital markets 
since august  we have completed four smart home arrangements 
details of these transactions aggregated as of the initial closing of each transaction and as of december  are as follows initial as of december  pool of mortgages par value billion billion risk in force par value billion billion notes sold to investors risk ceded principal amount million million each transaction begins with the formation of an unaffiliated  offshore reinsurance company 
we then enter into an agreement with the smart home reinsurer to cede to the reinsurer a portion of the risk and premium associated with a portfolio of loans 
each class relates to the loss coverage levels on the reinsured portfolio and is assigned a rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies 
we do not hold any of the credit linked notes issued as part of this structure  as such we have no significant variable interests in the structures and are not subject to consolidation under fin no 
r 
see overview of business results mortgage insurance traditional mortgage insurance above for further discussion 
financial guaranty financial guaranty contracts written with spes may be written directly with the spe or indirectly through a credit default swap done with a primary credit enhancer who issues a financial guaranty to the beneficial interest holders in the spe 
these spes are commonly employed in cdo transactions where portfolio managers are permitted to buy and sell assets 
our involvement with spes has a significant role in our financial guaranty business as a guarantor of beneficial interests held by third party investors 
the guarantees are generally financial guarantees of principal and interest payments to beneficial interest holders 
our guarantees are generally issued on highly rated senior securities issued by these spes and are not designed to absorb a significant portion of the variability created by the assets in the spes 
accordingly  we do not consolidate these spes 
an increase in losses within the spe structure is not an event that would require us to reconsider consolidation under fin no 
r 
however  if any of the trigger events discussed above were to occur and we were required to reconsider our variable interests in the spe  there is an increased risk that we may be required to consolidate some of these spes 
this is primarily due to the deterioration in subordination of the underlying collateral that has occurred since our initial determination  made at inception of the vies  that we were not the primary beneficiary 
the following table sets forth our total assets and maximum exposure to loss associated with significant financial guaranty variable interests in vies as of december for the years indicated vie in millions total assets maximum exposure total assets maximum exposure collateralized debt obligations asset backed obligations other structured finance total

investments we group assets in our investment portfolio into one of three main categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments classified as trading securities and derivatives are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of income 
effective january   we began classifying convertible securities including the fixed maturity component of securities previously classified as available for sale and the derivative component previously classified as available for sale and trading securities as hybrid securities 
hybrid securities generally combine both debt and equity characteristics 
prior to  the changes in fair value of the fixed maturity component of these securities were recorded in our consolidated statements of changes in common stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and the changes in fair value of the derivative component of these securities were recorded as a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income

 effective january   all changes in the fair value of the entire convertible security are now recorded as net gains or losses on securities in our consolidated statements of income 
our transition adjustment related to the adoption of sfas no 
increased retained earnings at january  by million  and reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by the same amount 
the transition amount includes unrealized gains of million net of tax and unrealized losses of million net of tax related to convertible securities at december  for securities in our investment portfolio  we conduct a quarterly evaluation of declines in market value of the securities to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
if a security s fair value is below the cost basis  and it is judged to be an other than temporary decline  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value through earnings as a realized loss and the fair value becomes the new basis for the security 
during  we recorded approximately million of charges related to declines in the fair value of securities primarily small cap value stocks considered to be other than temporary 
during  we recorded million of charges related to declines in the fair value of securities considered to be other than temporary 
there were no such charges in at december   and  there were no other investments held in the portfolio that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
other invested assets consist of approximately million of residential mortgage backed securities and million of alternative investments that are primarily private equity investments  including an investment in a fund sponsored and co managed by c bass that invests in real estate related securities 
during  we recorded a million loss considered to be other than temporary on our investment in this fund 
other invested assets are carried under the cost method or under the equity method 
our evaluation of market declines for other than temporary impairment is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
we consider a wide range of factors about the security and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by management in its impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential 
table of contents for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the full recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies

dividends from our subsidiaries  which include amounts received from our affiliates c bass and sherman  and permitted payments to us under our tax and expense sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries  along with income from our investment portfolio  are our principal sources of cash to pay stockholder dividends and to meet our obligations 
these obligations include our operating expenses  taxes and interest and principal payments on our long term debt and other borrowings 
the payment of dividends and other distributions to us by our insurance subsidiaries is limited by insurance laws and regulations 
in general  dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed extraordinary and require insurance regulatory approval 
in addition  although we have expense sharing arrangements in place with our principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their share of holding company level expenses  including interest expense on long term debt and other borrowings  these expense sharing arrangements may be changed at any time by the applicable state insurance departments 
our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  is subject to various conditions imposed by the rating agencies for us to maintain our ratings 
if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to tax and expense sharing arrangements is insufficient for us to fund our obligations  or our subsidiaries require more capital  we may be required to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt  by issuing additional equity or by selling assets  which we may be unable to do on favorable terms  if at all 
during the third quarter of  we sold a portion of our interest in sherman for approximately million in cash  which helped our capital and liquidity position in our mortgage insurance business 
in december  radian guaranty contributed its remaining ownership interest in sherman of million to radian group 
our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount that they may pay in dividends to us during the next months without first obtaining insurance department approval 
c bass did not pay dividends to us during compared to dividends of million paid to us during we do not expect to receive any future dividends from c bass 
sherman paid million and million of dividends to us during and  respectively 
all dividends from c bass and sherman have been initially distributed to our insurance subsidiaries  and therefore  are subject to regulatory limitations  as discussed above 
in the fourth quarter  we received regulatory approval for sherman to be owned by us rather than radian guaranty 
therefore  any future dividends from sherman would be received at the holding company and would not be subject to insurance regulatory approval 

table of contents we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for the through tax years 
the irs opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics and has proposed adjustments denying the associated tax benefits of these items 
we will contest all such proposed adjustments relating to the irs s opposition of the tax benefits in question and are working with tax counsel in our defense efforts 
when an examination has not been settled at the local examination division level  the irs will usually issue a day letter which contains details of the proposed adjustments and the taxpayer s rights to appeal 
upon receipt of the irs s day letter  we may make a payment with the us department of the treasury to avoid the accrual of the above market rate interest associated with our estimate of the potentially unsettled adjustment 
we anticipate receiving the day letter and making the payment on account at some point during the first two quarters of and the cash requirement for this payment is anticipated to be approximately to million 
any ultimate overpayment associated with the payment on account would be recovered through a formal claim for refund process 
our insurance subsidiaries are permitted to allocate capital resources within certain insurance department and rating agency guidelines by making direct investments 
in march  radian guaranty contributed approximately million in capital to radian insurance to support the additional risk that had been  and was expected to be  written in that entity  mostly through non traditional products  such as domestic or international credit default swaps 
we cancelled the authorization of radian europe to engage in the business of insurance in the united kingdom and other european union member states 
the capital held by radian europe  which was approximately million  net of expenses  was distributed back to radian guaranty in the fourth quarter of short term liquidity needs our liquidity needs over the next months include funds for the payment of dividends on our common stock  debt service payments on our outstanding long term debt and other borrowings  claim payments on our insured obligations  operating expenses  payment of amounts related to the termination of our pension plan and potentially  to fund a payment on account related to the irs investigation described above 
we expect to fund these requirements with available cash and amounts received under our expense sharing arrangements or as dividends from our insurance operating subsidiaries  subject to regulatory requirements  which may include dividends from working capital  all of which we expect to be sufficient to make such payments for at least the next months 
we have the ability to draw an additional million under our existing credit facility discussed below to support our short term liquidity needs and could  if necessary  seek to sell all or a portion of our remaining interest in sherman  subject to the existing option with sherman s management  although we cannot be certain that we would be able to sell our interest in sherman on favorable terms  if at all 
based on our current intention to pay quarterly common stock dividends of per share and assuming that our common stock outstanding remains constant at  shares at december   we would require approximately million to pay our quarterly dividends for the next months 
we will also require approximately million annually to pay the debt service on our outstanding long term debt and other borrowings  including the million that we have drawn down from our existing credit facility 
our sources of working capital consist mostly of premiums written by our insurance operating subsidiaries and investment income at both the parent company and operating subsidiary levels 
working capital is applied mainly to the payment of our insurance operating subsidiaries claims and operating expenses 
cash flows from operating activities for were million  compared to million for positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and other expenses 
we believe that the operating cash flows generated by each of our insurance subsidiaries will provide those subsidiaries with most of the funds to satisfy their claim payments and operating expenses for at least the next 
table of contents months 
in the likely event that claim payment obligations and operating expenses exceed the operating cash flows generated by our insurance operating subsidiaries  we believe that we have the ability to fund any excess from sales of short term investments maintained at the operating company 
in the event that we are unable to fund excess claim payments and operating expenses through the sale of short term investments  we may be required to incur unanticipated capital losses or delays in connection with the sale of less liquid securities held by us 
at december   the parent company had cash and liquid investment securities of million 
long term liquidity needs our most significant need for liquidity beyond the next twelve months is the repayment of the principal amount of our outstanding long term debt and other borrowings  a portion of which is due in we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs using excess working capital  sales of investments  additional borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary  or through the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities 
the current turmoil in the mortgage market has created a situation where we would likely not be able to refinance our long term debt if it were due currently 
we expect that the market cycle will improve by  but cannot be certain this will happen 
in february  the sec declared effective our million universal shelf registration statement 
on june   we issued under the shelf registration statement million of unsecured senior notes at a price of of their principal amount 
these notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually on june and december the notes mature on june  we have the option to redeem some or all of the notes at any time with not less than days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed

on december   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on december  this new facility includes an additional million uncommitted line that we may exercise at our option  subject to our obtaining necessary commitments from lenders 
on august   we drew down million in principal amount under this facility 
the amount drawn down bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus basis points which resets periodically as specified by the credit facility 
we contributed million of the proceeds of the draw down to radian asset assurance to support the risk written in our financial guaranty business 
the remaining million will be used for general corporate purposes 
although we had no immediate need for additional liquidity  in light of current market conditions  we drew on the facility to provide us with greater financial flexibility and adequate liquidity for the long term 
after the draw down  the remaining credit available under the facility is million 

table of contents in september  radian asset assurance completed a transaction for million of money market committed preferred custodial trust securities  pursuant to which it entered into a series of three perpetual put options on its own preferred stock to radian asset securities inc radian asset securities  our wholly owned subsidiary 
radian asset securities in turn entered into a series of three perpetual put options on its own preferred stock on substantially identical terms to the radian asset assurance preferred stock 
the counterparties to the radian asset securities put options are three trusts established by two major investment banks 
the trusts were created as a vehicle for providing capital support to radian asset assurance by allowing radian asset assurance to obtain immediate access to additional capital at its sole discretion at any time through the exercise of one or more of the put options and the corresponding exercise of one or more corresponding radian asset securities put options 
if the radian asset assurance put options were exercised  radian asset securities  through the radian asset assurance preferred stock thereby acquired  and investors  through their equity investment in the radian asset securities preferred stock  would have rights to the assets of radian asset assurance as an equity investor in radian asset assurance 
such rights would be subordinate to policyholders claims  as well as to claims of general unsecured creditors of radian asset assurance  but ahead of our claims  through efsg  as the owner of the common stock of radian asset assurance 
if all the radian asset assurance put options were exercised  radian asset assurance would receive up to million in return for the issuance of its own perpetual preferred stock  the proceeds of which would be usable for any purpose  including the payment of claims 
dividend payments on the preferred stock will be cumulative only if radian asset assurance pays dividends on its common stock 
each trust see note of notes to consolidated financial statements is restricted to holding high quality  short term commercial paper investments to ensure that it can meet its obligations under the put options 
to fund these investments  each trust issued its own auction market perpetual preferred stock 
on september   fitch downgraded its rating of the trusts to bbb from a 
as a result of this downgrade  the maximum spread over libor payable by us for maintenance of these options increased to basis points from basis points 
because sufficient auction clearing bids have not been made  the reset auction rate for the options has reset at this maximum rate  resulting in a million increase in the annual cost to us of maintaining these options 
each trust remains rated a by s p 
the initial costs to issue this facility were recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital

critical accounting policies sec guidance defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment and housing environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is set forth below 
reserve for losses we establish reserves to provide for losses and the estimated costs of settling claims in both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in the mortgage insurance segment  reserves for losses generally are not established until we are notified that a borrower has missed two consecutive payments 
we also establish reserves for associated lae  consisting of the estimated cost of the claims administration process  including legal and other fees and expenses associated with administering the claims process 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the reserve for losses 
we maintain an extensive database of claim payment history and use models  based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by its servicer  and macroeconomic factors such as regional economic conditions that involve significant variability over time  as well as more static factors such as the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists  to help determine the likelihood that a default will result in a claim  the amount that we will pay if a default becomes a claim and based on these estimates  the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency  which generally require a larger reserve 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan  and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
if a default cures  historically  a large percentage of defaulted loans have cured before going to claim  although this rate has fallen significantly in the current deteriorating housing environment  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserves from prior years if the reduction in reserves from cures is greater than the additional reserves for those loans that are nearing foreclosure or have become claims 
as a result of changes in estimates of losses on prior years defaults  the mortgage insurance provision for losses increased by million in and decreased by million and million in and  respectively 
in the mortgage insurance segment  we do not specifically reserve for defaults that we believe to have occurred but that have not been reported to us on a timely basis by lending institutions or for loans that we believe have cured but that have not been reported to us on a timely basis 
we believe this number would not be material 
all estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are made as they become necessary 

table of contents we generally do not establish reserves for loans that are in default if we believe that we will not be liable for the payment of a claim with respect to that default 
for example  for those defaults in which we are in a second loss position  we calculate what the reserve would have been if there had been no deductible 
if the existing deductible is greater than the reserve amount for any given default  we do not establish a reserve for the default 
we generally do not establish loss reserves for expected future claims on insured mortgages that are not in default or believed to be in default 
see reserve for second lien premium deficiency below for an exception to this general principle 
our model differentiates between prime and other products and takes into account the different loss development patterns and borrower behavior that is inherent in these products  whether we are in a first or second loss position and whether there are deductibles on the loan 
we use actuarial projection methodologies to produce a range of reserves by product and a midpoint for each product based on historical factors such as ultimate claim rates and claim severity 
the following table shows the mortgage insurance range of loss and lae reserves  as determined by our actuaries  and recorded reserves for losses and lae  as of december  and as of december  as of december  loss and lae reserves in millions low high recorded low high recorded mortgage insurance operations reserves for our mortgage insurance business are set at the exact point of our modeled output for loss and lae reserves 
in light of the regular adjustments made to the underlying assumptions in our model as discussed above  we believe the amount generated by our model at december  best represents the most accurate estimate of our future losses and lae 
we believe the high and low amounts highlighted in the table above represent a reasonable estimate of the range of possible outcomes around our recorded reserve point for the period indicated 
we considered the sensitivity on loss reserve estimates at december   by assessing the potential changes resulting from a hypothetical parallel shift in severity and claim rate 
for example  assuming all other factors remain constant  for every change in claim severity or claim rate  we estimated a million change in our loss reserves at december  in the financial guaranty segment  we establish loss reserves on our non derivative financial guaranty contracts 
we establish case reserves for specifically identified impaired credits that have defaulted and allocated non specific reserves for specific credits that we expect to default 
in addition  we establish unallocated non specific reserves for our entire portfolio based on estimated statistical loss probabilities 
as discussed below  the reserving policies used by the financial guaranty industry are continuing to evolve and are subject to change 
the following table shows the breakdown of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses for our financial guaranty segment at the end of each period indicated december in thousands financial guaranty case reserves allocated non specific unallocated non specific trade credit reinsurance and other case reserves incurred but not reported ibnr total 
table of contents our financial guaranty loss reserve policy requires management to make the following key estimates and judgments setting both case reserves and allocated non specific reserves requires us to exercise judgment in estimating the severity of the claim that is likely to result from an identified reserving event  which may be any amount up to the full amount of the insured obligation 
the reliability of this estimate depends on the reliability of the information regarding the likely severity of the claim and the judgments made by management with respect to that information 
even when we are aware of the occurrence of an event that requires the establishment of a reserve  our estimate of the severity of the claim that is likely to result from that event may not ultimately be correct 
at december   we had case reserves and lae reserves on financial guaranty policies of million 
of this amount  million was attributable to a single manufactured housing transaction originated and serviced by conseco finance corp 
we have a high degree of certainty that we will suffer losses with respect to this insured obligation equal to the amount reserved  which equals the total amount of the remaining insured obligation 
the case and lae reserves also include million attributable to reinsured obligations on which our total par outstanding is million 
these reserves are established based on amounts conveyed to us by the ceding companies and confirmed by us 
we do not have any reasonable expectation that the ultimate losses will deviate materially from the amount reserved 
the remaining million represents lae reserves attributable to seven insured obligations  partially offset by salvage recoveries on six other insured obligations 
at december   credits were included in our allocated non specific reserves of million  including million related to a bbb rated structured finance credit discussed above 
see results of operations financial guaranty year ended december  compared to december  for more information regarding this credit 
we expect that we will suffer losses with respect to these insured obligations approximately equal to the amount reserved of million 
these credits have a gross par amount of million 
our unallocated non specific reserves are established over time by applying expected default factors to the premiums earned during each reporting period 
the expected lifetime losses for each credit are determined by multiplying the expected frequency of losses on that credit by the expected severity of losses on that credit and multiplying this number  the loss factor  by that credit s outstanding par amount 
the expected frequency and severity of losses for each credit is generated from three sources two that are published by major rating agencies and one that is generated by a proprietary internal model based on the product class  published rating and term to maturity for each credit 
we set the expected lifetime losses for each credit at a point in the range between the highest and lowest expected lifetime loss factors generated by the rating agency and internally generated models 
the default rates published by rating agencies tend to be very low because we mostly insure investment grade obligations that  historically  have a very low probability of default 
although the default rate is low  the amount of losses upon default can be very high because we tend to insure large financial obligations 
because of the low incidence of losses on financial guaranty obligations  it is also very difficult to estimate the timing of losses on our insured obligations for which we have not yet established a case reserve or allocated non specific reserve 
the default factors for approximated of earned premiums on public finance credits and of earned premiums on structured finance credits 
the default factors for the years ended december  and approximated of earned premiums on public finance credits and of earned premiums on structured finance credits 
as a result of favorable loss development  we were able to lower the default factor for structured finance credits in our unallocated non specific loss reserve at december   was million 
the range between the unallocated non specific reserves that would have resulted from applying the highest and lowest default factors generated by any of the three models was approximately million to million  which we believe provides a reasonably likely range of expected losses 

table of contents at each balance sheet date  we also evaluate both the model generated default factors and our unallocated non specific reserves against management s subjective view of qualitative factors to ensure that the default factors and the unallocated non specific reserves represent management s best estimate of the expected losses on our portfolio of credits for which we have not established a case reserve or an allocated non specific reserve 
these qualitative factors include existing economic and business conditions  overall credit quality trends resulting from industry  geographic  economic and political conditions  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  changes in underwriting policies and procedures and seasoning of the book of business 
the macroeconomic factors that we evaluate are outside of our control and are subject to considerable variability 
the company specific factors that we evaluate also require us to make subjective judgments 
in addition  a significant change in the size of our portfolio underlying the unallocated non specific reserves  such as through the expiration of policies or the refunding or recapture of insured exposures  could require an adjustment to the default factors or our level of unallocated non specific reserves 
our estimates of our reserves for losses and lae for our financial guaranty segment s other lines of business  mainly trade credit reinsurance  depend upon the receipt of accurate information on claims and loss estimates from ceding companies 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and ibnr  on trade credit reinsurance 
as the business is now in run off  the receipt of information from ceding companies is likely to be more sporadic and the setting of reserves will be more reliant on management estimates 
we use historical loss information and make inquiries to the cedants of known events as a means of validating our loss assumptions 
setting the loss reserves in both business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
we cannot be certain that we have correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
exposure draft 
the exposure draft clarifies how sfas no 
applies to financial guaranty insurance contracts and provides guidance with respect to the timing of claim liability recognition  premium recognition and the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  specifically for financial guaranty contracts issued by insurance companies that are not accounted for as derivative contracts under sfas no 
the goal of the proposed statement is to reduce diversity in accounting by financial guaranty insurers  thereby enabling users to better understand and more readily compare insurers financial statements 
final guidance from the fasb regarding accounting for financial guaranty insurance is expected to be issued in if the exposure draft is issued as proposed  the effect on the consolidated financial statements  particularly with respect to revenue recognition and claims liability  could be material 
derivative instruments and hedging activity we account for derivatives under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
in general  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values and changes in fair value recorded in net income unless the derivatives qualify as hedges 
if the derivatives qualify as hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
all our derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or derivative liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
the interest rate swaps that we have entered into qualify as hedges and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
our forward foreign currency contracts  credit protection in the form of credit default swaps and certain financial guaranty contracts within 
table of contents both our mortgage insurance and financial guaranty segments and nims do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 so changes in their fair value are included in current earnings in our consolidated statements of income 
net unrealized gains and losses on credit default swaps and certain other derivative contracts are included in either other assets or derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
we account for nims as derivatives under sfas no 
as a result of the severe disruption in the subprime mortgage market  we refined our methodology for valuing nims in the third quarter of consistent with our increased loss expectations for this product 
prior to the third quarter  we valued our nims bonds by evaluating recent premium levels and the present value of future estimated cash flows 
when we determined that a nims bond was not performing in accordance with our expectations  we estimated a claim amount that we would be required to pay on each bond 
refinement to our model addresses the potential vulnerability of all nims bonds under current market conditions  including those performing within our expectations 
our refined methodology uses market based roll rates and internally developed loss assumptions and  we estimate losses in each securitization underlying a nims bond 
we then project prepayment fees on the underlying collateral in each securitization  incorporating actual and historical prepayment experience 
the estimated loss and prepayment speeds are used to estimate the cash flows for each underlying securitization and nims bond  and ultimately  to produce the projected credit losses for each nims bond at legal maturity 
in addition to expected credit losses  the fair value for each nims bond is approximated by incorporating further loss stresses  future expected premiums from the nims bond  and an estimated rate of return that a counterparty would require in assuming the exposure from us 
this required rate of return is evaluated based on market rates of return implied by available market indices on mortgage backed securities of similar underlying credit risk 
changes in our estimated fair value marks are recorded as a gain loss on derivatives and paid losses are recorded as a realized loss 
because nims guarantees are not market traded instruments  considerable judgment is required in estimating fair value 
the use of different assumptions and or methodologies could have a significant effect on estimated fair values 
the gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models 
estimated fair value amounts are determined by using market information to the extent available  and in most cases  observable market information must be combined with unobservable market inputs in order to estimate fair value 
these unobservable market inputs are required to consider differences that exist in the collateral underlying our contracts and the collateral underlying market indices as well as the structural features of our contracts 
for corporate pool cdos  credit spreads on individual names in our collateral pool are used to derive an equivalent risk tranche on an industry standard credit default swap index 
when credit spreads on individual names are not available  the average credit spread of similar companies is used 
for certain of our non corporate cdos  dealer quotes on similar structured transactions are used 
in determining our december  valuations  generally market indices are used to estimate fair value on these deals 
in determining gains and losses on rmbs and cmbs cdos  we utilize a generic spread from abx and cmbx 
the generic spread utilized is based on the nature of the underlying collateral in each deal 
the gains and losses on trust preferred securities deals are derived from internally generated models utilizing observable cds spreads of a group of investment grade and high yield financial institutions 
because our collateral does not directly track market indices that are available  adjustments to account for differences in term  credit quality  and diversification of underlying collateral are made in our internal models 
in addition  our internal models are adjusted to account for differences between our financial guaranty contracts and similar derivative contracts executed by other primary market participants  the primary difference being the lack of a requirement to post collateral with our counterparties when our contracts are in a liability position 
in instances where dealer quotes are not available and market indices are not appropriate  we consider the reinsurance market to be the principal market for purposes of determining fair value  therefore  we utilize an internal model  similar to those used by reinsurers  to estimate fair value 
prior to  many of our non corporate cdos were valued using this methodology as the reinsurance market for these products was much more robust than the current environment 
significant differences may exist with respect to the available market information and assumptions used to determine gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts 
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts we 
table of contents could realize in a current market exchange due to the lack of a liquid market 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas nos 
and as discussed above in investments we adopted sfas no 
on january  accordingly  securities that were previously classified as available for sale and trading securities on our consolidated balance sheets were reclassified to hybrid securities on our consolidated balance sheets on the date of adoption and as provided by sfas no 
 we elected to record convertible securities at fair value and changes in the fair value are recorded as net gains or losses on securities 
a summary of our derivative information and its components as of the periods indicated is as follows december in millions balance sheets derivative financial guaranty contracts nims put options on cps credit default swaps balance at end of period derivative contracts notional value gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized losses gains the components of the change in fair value of derivative instruments are as follows year ended december in millions statements of income derivative financial guaranty contracts nims credit default swaps put options on cps other net losses gains the fair value of the put options on cps 
prior to  this amount was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the application of sfas no 
 as amended  could result in volatility from period to period in gains and losses as reported on our consolidated statements of income 
these gains and losses often result from changes in corporate credit or asset backed spreads and changes in the creditworthiness of underlying corporate entities or the credit performance of the assets underlying an asset backed security 
any incurred gains or losses on such contracts would be recognized as a change in the fair value of derivative instruments 
we are unable to predict the effect this volatility may have on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we record premiums and origination costs related to credit default swaps and certain other derivative contracts in premiums written and policy acquisition costs  respectively  on our consolidated statements of income 
our classification of these contracts is the same whether we are a direct insurer or we assume these contracts 
in accordance with our risk management policies  we may enter into derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   we were a party to two interest rate swap contracts relating to our unsecured senior notes due these interest rate swaps are designed as fair value hedges that hedge the change in fair value of our long term debt arising from interest rate increases 
during and  the fair value hedges were effective 
therefore  the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of income was offset by the change in the fair value of the hedged debt 
these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in january deferred policy acquisition costs costs associated with the acquisition of mortgage insurance business  consisting of compensation and other policy issuance and underwriting expenses  are initially deferred and reported as deferred policy acquisition costs 
because sfas no 
specifically excludes mortgage guaranty insurance from its guidance relating to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  amortization of these costs for each underwriting year book of business is charged against revenue in proportion to estimated gross profits over the estimated life of the policies using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this includes accruing interest on the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs 
estimates of expected gross profit including persistency and loss development assumptions for each underwriting year and product type used as a basis for amortization are evaluated regularly  and the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted by a charge or credit to the statement of income if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
considerable judgment is used in evaluating these factors when updating the assumptions 
the use of different assumptions would have a significant effect on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs in our financial guaranty business are comprised of those expenses that vary with  and are principally related to  the production of insurance premiums  including commissions paid on reinsurance assumed  salaries and related costs of underwriting and marketing personnel  rating agency fees  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses  offset by commission income on premiums ceded to reinsurers 
acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned for each underwriting year 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is adjusted regularly based on the expected timing of both upfront and installment based premiums 
the estimation of installment based premiums requires considerable judgment  and different assumptions could produce different results 
origination costs for derivative mortgage and financial guaranty contracts are expensed as incurred 
as noted under reserve for losses above  the fasb is considering the accounting model used by the financial guaranty industry for deferred policy acquisition costs 
reserve for second lien premium deficiency in the third quarter of  we initially established a million reserve for premium deficiency on our second lien business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our second lien business is considered to be a separate product due to the fact that the business is managed separately  priced differently from our traditional products and the customer base is different from that of our traditional products 
sfas no 
requires a premium deficiency reserve if the net present value of the expected future losses and expenses exceeds expected future premiums and existing reserves 
we reassess our expectations for premiums and losses and expenses for our second lien business each quarter and update our premium deficiency accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  the second lien deficiency increased by approximately million as a result of further deterioration in the performance of our second lien portfolio

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
examples of market risk include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
we perform  on an annual basis  a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects of market risk exposures on our investment securities and certain financial guaranty contracts 
this analysis is performed by expressing the potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
our sensitivity analysis is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in yield curve with all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we review changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity prices to determine whether there has been a material change in our market risk since that presented in connection with our annual sensitivity analysis 
the results of our sensitivity analysis at december  are as follows interest rate risk the primary market risk in our investment portfolio is interest rate risk  namely the fair value sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate risk 
as a result of the analysis  we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investment assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the interest rate risk associated with our fixed income securities by modeling an instantaneous increase and decrease in interest rates 
as of december   hypothetical increases in interest rates of and basis points would cause decreases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately from billion to billion and from billion to billion  respectively 
similarly  hypothetical decreases in interest rates of and basis points would cause increases in the market value of our fixed income portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately from billion to billion and from billion to billion  respectively 
in april  we entered into interest rate swaps that  in effect  converted a portion of our fixed rate long term debt to a variable rate based on a spread over the six month libor for the remaining term of the debt 
these swaps were terminated in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the market value and cost of our long term debt at december  was million and million  respectively 
credit spread risk we provide credit protection in the form of credit default swaps and other financial guaranty contracts that are marked to market through earnings under the requirements of sfas no 
with the exception of nims  these financial guaranty derivative contracts generally insure obligations with considerable subordination beneath our exposure at the time of issuance 
the underlying asset classes of these obligations include corporate  asset backed  residential mortgage backed  and commercial mortgage backed securities 
during  with the exception of nims for which deterioration in value is primarily attributed to credit losses  the value of our financial guaranty derivative contracts were affected predominantly by changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations collateral  in some cases compounded by ratings downgrades of insured obligations 
as credit spreads and ratings change  the values of these financial guaranty derivative contracts will change and the resulting gains and losses will be recorded in our net income 

table of contents sensitivity to changes in credit spreads can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous shift in credit spread curves 
the following table presents the pre tax change in fair value of our financial guaranty derivatives portfolio as a result of instantaneous shifts in credit spreads as of december  these changes were calculated using the valuation methods described in critical accounting policies included herein 
contracts for which the fair value is calculated using specific dealer quotes or actual transaction prices are excluded from the following table as we are unable to obtain data necessary to model hypothetical changes in these contracts 
change in credit spreads in thousands spread widening spread tightening estimated pre tax gain loss foreign exchange rate risk one means of assessing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments is to model effects on reported earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our currency exposure as of december  by identifying our investment portfolio that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as part of our analysis  our investment portfolio foreign currency exposures were remeasured  generally assuming a decrease in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in foreign currencies by million as of december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in euros 
the value of the euro against the us dollar strengthened from at december  to at december  at december   we held approximately million of investments denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the yen against the us dollar was at december  compared to at december  equity market price at december   the market value and cost of our equity securities were million and million  respectively 
included in the market value and cost of our equity securities is million and million  respectively  related to trading securities 
exposure to changes in equity market prices can be estimated by assessing potential changes in market values on our equity investments resulting from a hypothetical broad based decline in equity market prices of 
with all other factors remaining constant  we estimated that such a decrease would reduce our investment portfolio held in equity investments by million as of december  there have been no material changes in our equity market price risk during the year ended december
