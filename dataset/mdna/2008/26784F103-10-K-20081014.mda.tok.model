item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general sales consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs  third party delivery charges  warehousing and sorting expenses  insurance and workers compensation costs 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company are independent contractor owner operators who provide their own vehicles as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that delivery personnel are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include salaries  wages and benefit costs incurred at the business center level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative 
table of contents costs related to such functions 
also included in sg a expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to business center and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do local and regional distribution or fleet management services because driver payments for on demand services are generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services due primarily to the smaller size of the vehicle required 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing and collection 
as a result of these variances  the company s gross profit margin is dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
during the years ended july   and  sales to office depot  inc represented approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
sales to the company s five largest customers  including office depot  represented approximately  and of the company s consolidated sales for the years ended july   and  respectively 
the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to office  communication  it equipment and software  leasehold improvements and intangible assets  which are primarily customer lists 
a significant portion of the company s sales is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and canada are similar 
the conversion rate of canadian dollars to us dollars increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported sales and net income 
management does not believe that the effect of these changes on the company s net income for the fiscal years ended july   and has been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized after services are rendered to customers 
there may be a time lag between pickup and delivery and the generation of an invoice 
accordingly  unbilled revenue is recognized for those shipments that have been delivered but have not been invoiced 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the company has two reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  canada and the united states 
these two regions were identified as reporting units in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
because discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of these regions 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
based on this test  the company determined that no impairment exists during the three years ended july  other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 

table of contents other assets recoverable contract contingency costs the company has recorded as an other asset certain costs related to contractually reimbursable contingency costs incurred in connection with the launch of certain contracts in accordance with eitf  accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements  these costs will be recovered during the initial contract term  from a designated portion of the unit price specified in the contract 
should the contract be cancelled for any reason  the customer is obligated to reimburse the company for any unamortized balance 
total recoverable contract contingency costs capitalized at july  and amount to  thousand and  thousand  respectively 
self insured claims liability the company is primarily self insured for us workers compensation and vehicle liability claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
the company s estimates are based on actual experience and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  the company would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of accounts receivable at july  compared to approximately at july  income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
during the year ended july  and  the company repatriated approximately million and million  respectively from its canadian subsidiary 
except for certain applicable state income taxes  the company was able to substantially offset the us income tax liability arising from the dividends with foreign tax credits

revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the year 
the net exchange differences resulting from these translations are recorded in stockholders equity 
where amounts denominated in a foreign currency are converted into us dollars by remittance or repayment  the realized exchange differences are included as other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
treasury stock acquired and retired treasury stock is recorded at cost 
delaware law permits treasury shares to be retired when appropriately authorized by the board of directors  and the company has retired such shares by appropriate reductions in the value of common stock and additional paid in capital

as the core growth rate accelerates above the current level  management expects to realize additional leverage from its relatively fixed cost infrastructure

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for foreign exchange exposure compares the revenue and net income figures from canadian operations over the previous four quarters at the actual exchange rate versus a decrease in the exchange rate 
based on this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenue of approximately million and a decrease in net income of approximately million over this period 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management 
interest rate exposure the company has no interest rate protection arrangements in effect at the present time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
