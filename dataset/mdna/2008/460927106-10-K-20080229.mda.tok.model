intervest bancshares corporation is a registered financial holding company referred to by itself in this report as the holding company 
at december   the holding company had two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries  intervest national bank the bank and intervest mortgage corporation hereafter  together with intervest bancshares corporation  referred to collectively as the company on a consolidated basis 
the holding company also had four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v  which were formed in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
for a discussion of the company s business  see the section entitled item business in this report 
the company s revenues consist of interest  dividends and fees earned on its interest earning assets  which are comprised of mortgage loans  securities and other short term investments  and noninterest income 
the company s expenses consist of interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  which are comprised of deposits  debentures and other short term borrowings  as well as its operating and general expenses 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is affected by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
noninterest income consists mostly of loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments 
when a mortgage loan is repaid prior to maturity  the company may recognize prepayment income  which consists of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of additional prepayment fees and or interest in certain cases  in accordance with the prepayment provisions of the mortgage loan 
the company s income from loan prepayments fluctuates and cannot be predicted 
normally  loan prepayments tend to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tend to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates 
however  given the nature and type of mortgage loans the company originates  including their short average life  the company may still experience loan prepayments notwithstanding the effects of movements in interest rates 
noninterest expenses consist of the following salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  advertising and promotion  professional fees and services  fdic insurance  general insurance and other operating and general expenses 
the company s profitability is also significantly affected by general and local economic conditions  competition  changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate including rental and cooperative condominium apartment buildings  office buildings  mixed use properties  shopping centers  hotels  restaurants  industrial properties  parking lots garages and vacant land 
loans in the portfolio had an average life of approximately years as of december  the company does not own or originate sub prime single family home loans or construction development loans 
the company tends to lend in areas that are in the process of being revitalized or redeveloped  with a concentration of loans on properties located in new york state and the state of florida 
a large number of the properties in new york are located in manhattan  brooklyn  queens and the bronx 
a large number of the properties in florida are located in clearwater  tampa  st 
petersburg  fort lauderdale  miami and orlando 
many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents  which may in turn limit the borrower s ability to repay those mortgage loans 
at december   the company also had loans on properties in alabama  connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  massachusetts  maryland  michigan  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina and virginia 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis herein is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
among the more significant policies of the company are those that govern accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in its financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the company believes that currently its only significant critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about future loan chargeoffs 
the impact of a sudden large chargeoff could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect the company s earnings and financial position 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment as to the estimated losses that may result from defaults in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the following factors i size of the loan portfolio 
the company s portfolio has a number of individual loans with large balances which increases the portfolio s risk profile 
at december   the average real estate loan was million  with the largest loan being million 
in addition  loans with principal balances of million or more represented of the outstanding loan portfolio  ii nature of the loan portfolio 
the company s portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some vacant properties and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties 
further  loans on vacant properties and vacant land typically do not have income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrowers for repayment 
the properties underlying the company s mortgage loans are also concentrated by location  and this concentration increases the risk associated with the loan portfolio 
the properties are concentrated in two states  new york and florida 
a large number of the properties in new york are located in manhattan  brooklyn  queens and the bronx 
a large number of the properties in florida are located in clearwater  tampa  fort lauderdale  miami  orlando and st 
petersburg 
many of the multifamily properties located in new york city and surrounding boroughs are also subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents 
many of the properties are also located in sections of the cities noted above that are being revitalized or redeveloped  which further increases the risk associated with the portfolio  
table of contents iii specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
whenever the company experiences payment problems with a loan  an internal review of that loan is performed by either or both of the company s two senior lending officers the chairman and the president of the florida division of the bank to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 
this credit rating directly affects the computation of the allowance for loan losses 
the estimated loss factors that the company applies to its loans to calculate the allowance for loan losses increase as a loan s credit rating decreases 
nonaccrual and or problem loans are normally downgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which in turn impacts the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the review includes the physical inspection of such properties and the monitoring of impositions and insurance premiums to preserve the company s security interest in the properties 
additionally  the company engages independent third parties to perform quarterly loan portfolio reviews  which include all loans on nonaccrual status 
the company takes into consideration the nature and extent of the collateralization of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing and any other problem loans in its determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimates of fair value of the collateral properties is determined based on a variety of information  including available appraisals and the knowledge and experience of the company s two senior lending officers related to values of properties in the company s market areas 
determination of the need for updated appraisals is made on a loan by loan basis 
in addition to appraisals  the company also takes into consideration the type  location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions in the area the property is located in assessing estimates of fair value  iv historical chargeoffs and recoveries 
although the company has experienced only one loss in the last five years from its real estate lending activities million in from the sale of a property acquired through foreclosure  there can be no assurance that potential losses do not exist in the current loan portfolio 
furthermore  the company experienced an increase in the number of loans on nonaccrual status in  v adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
all nonaccrual and problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to the company at the time of the review 
based on these reviews  the company s two senior lending officers make an assessment as to whether there are specific issues unique to each problem loan or whether such issues identified are generic to the portfolio  which may in turn necessitate a change to the company s overall estimated loss factors noted below that are used to calculate the allowance for loan losses  and vi the perception of the company s two senior lending officers of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas  which are concentrated in new york and florida 
the real estate market in general continues to experience a slowdown that began in  with the magnitude thereof being more pronounced in certain areas of the country than others and in certain types of properties  as widely reported by the media 
this slowdown increases the level of risk in the company s loan portfolio 
based on the assessment of the factors noted above  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses that is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from estimated loss factors currently ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable  and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a credit grade of special mention or lower and  from time to time  an allocated or specific portion on certain loans  particularly for loans that have been identified as being impaired 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
the company s policy is to normally charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 

table of contents the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis 
the company believes  based on information known to it at december   that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio 
although the company believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
for example  a prolonged downturn in real estate values and or local economic conditions could have an adverse impact on the company s asset quality and may result in an increase in future loan charge offs and loan loss provisions 
finally  the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination

table of contents cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include interest bearing and noninterest bearing cash balances with banks  and other short term investments that have original maturities of three months or less 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at december  the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  calls of securities  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative investment opportunities 
security investments securities are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost when management has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
such investments  which are held by the bank  decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease reflected maturities and calls during the period exceeding new purchases 
the bank used the proceeds from the security repayments to partially fund new loans

at december  and  the held to maturity portfolio s estimated fair value was million and million  respectively 
at december   the held to maturity portfolio had a net unrealized gain of million  compared to a net unrealized loss of million at december  management believes that the cause of unrealized losses and gains in the portfolio is directly related to changes in market interest rates  which is consistent with its experience 
in general  as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  their fair value will increase 
management views any unrealized losses to be temporary based on the impact of changes in interest rates  the very short maturities of the investments and their high credit quality 
in addition  the bank has the ability and intent to hold securities that have unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient for the fair value of the securities to recover  which may be at maturity 
historically  the bank has always recovered the cost of its investment securities upon maturity

these deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive and have a higher cost than deposits with no stated maturities  such as checking  savings and money market accounts 
at december   million of time deposits mature by december  the bank expects that a substantial portion of these deposits will be renewed and stay with the bank 
the bank s loan to deposit ratio was at december  during  the bank utilized funds from maturing investment securities to partially fund the growth in its loan portfolio  which has caused this ratio to increase from at december  the bank s goal is to target its loan to deposit ratio at approximately 
the bank borrows funds on an overnight or short term basis to manage its liquidity needs

intervest mortgage corporation 
intervest mortgage corporation s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its mortgage loans and the rates paid on its debentures 
intervest mortgage corporation relies on the issuance of its subordinated debentures in registered  best efforts offerings to the public as its primary source of funds to support its loan originations 
intervest mortgage corporation needs to pay competitive interest rates to sell its debentures and also incurs underwriting commissions and other fees when debentures are sold  which reduce the net proceeds realized 
in addition to funds from sales of debentures  as the bank s mortgage loan portfolio has grown  service fee income received by intervest mortgage corporation from the bank has comprised a larger percentage of intervest mortgage corporation s earnings and resulting cash inflows

as a result  both cash and short term investments as well as the proceeds from the repayment of maturing mortgages will be available for investment in new mortgage loans 
the company continues to experience increased competitive market conditions and lower pricing in originating new loans  which has made it more difficult for intervest mortgage corporation to identify suitable mortgage investment opportunities 
the level of outstanding loan commitments fluctuates with market conditions and is unpredictable 
intervest mortgage corporation experienced a significant increase in nonaccrual loans in the third quarter of at december   of its mortgage loan portfolio million was on nonaccrual status  which has adversely affected its net interest income and cash flows derived therefrom  and has placed a greater reliance on cash flows generated form intervest mortgage corporation s intercompany services provided to the bank 
if this level of nonaccrual loans were to increase or continue for an extended period of time  intervest mortgage corporation s ability to issue new debentures to the public  originate new loans and meet its operating cash flow requirements could be adversely affected 
at december   intervest mortgage corporation s interest income from its accruing loan portfolio only slightly exceeded the interest expense from its outstanding debentures

table of contents regulatory capital the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
as disclosed in detail elsewhere in this report  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s and the company s financial statements 
the bank is required to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december  and  management believes the bank met its capital adequacy requirements and is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively 
management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the bank s designation as a well capitalized institution 
information regarding the bank s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets the holding company on a consolidated basis is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb 
these guidelines require a ratio of tier or core capital  as defined in the guidelines  to total risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the guidelines also require a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total average assets of not less than 
at december  and  management believes that the holding company met its capital adequacy requirements 
information regarding consolidated regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital tier capital total risk based capital net risk weighted assets average assets for regulatory purposes tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets at december  and  there were million of qualifying capital securities outstanding  respectively  representing the total outstanding debentures issued to statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v by the holding company  net of the holding company s investments in those trusts 
the entire million is included in tier i capital 
the inclusion of these securities in tier capital is currently limited to of core capital elements  as defined in the fdic regulations 
in  the federal reserve issued a final rule that retains trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhc  but with stricter limitations on the use of such securities 
the rule provides a transition period for bhcs to meet the new  stricter limitations within regulatory capital by allowing the new limits on restricted core capital elements to become fully effective as of march  
table of contents until march   bhcs generally must comply with the current tier capital limits 
that is  bhcs generally must calculate their tier capital on a basis that limits the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities to percent of the sum of qualifying common stockholder s equity  qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities 
amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier capital 
beginning march   qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities  as well as certain types of minority interest  are limited to percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill 
the company does not have any goodwill  outstanding preferred stock or minority interests 
beginning march   the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier capital are limited to percent of tier capital net of goodwill 
however  amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organization s funding and financial condition 
the final rule also provides that in the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures  the associated trust preferred securities must be treated as limited life preferred stock 
thus  in the last five years of the life of the note  the outstanding amount of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital  subject  together with subordinated debt and other limited life preferred stock  to a limit of percent of tier capital 
during this period  the trust preferred securities will be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from tier capital during the last year of life of the underlying note 
as of december  and  assuming the holding company had excluded all of its eligible trust preferred securities from tier capital and included such amount in tier capital  the holding company would still have exceeded the well capitalized threshold under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of trust preferred securities 
asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on its net interest income and capital 
the company does not engage in trading or hedging activities  nor does it invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 

table of contents in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to in the industry as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
many of the company s floating rate loans have a floor  or minimum rate  that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the unfavorable effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
however  the company may nonetheless experience loan prepayments  the amount of which cannot be predicted  and reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the table below summarizes interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   that are scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown 
in thousands months months over years over years total loans securities held to maturity short term investments frb and fhlb stock total rate sensitive assets deposit accounts interest checking deposits savings deposits money market deposits certificates of deposit total deposits debentures and mortgage note payable accrued interest on all borrowed funds total borrowed funds total rate sensitive liabilities gap repricing differences cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets significant assumptions used in preparing the gap table above follow floating rate loans and debentures payable are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature 
fixed rate loans and debentures payable are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million are also excluded from the table although some portion may to return to an accrual status 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts  and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 

table of contents the company s one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or of total assets  at december   compared to a positive sensitivity gap of million  or of total assets at december  the change in the gap primarily reflects the runoff of loans with a repricing or remaining maturity of less than one year being replaced with new fixed rate loans with maturities of greater than one year  a higher level of nonaccrual loans and purchases of security investments with longer term maturities 
consistent with the competitive lending environment  a greater percentage of new loans were originated on a fixed rate basis in for purposes of computing the gap  all deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by the bank did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year gap would have been a positive at december   compared to a positive at december  recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities  and the issuance of its debentures 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital 
to this regard  the bank does internal analyses by preparing interest rate shock scenarios representing the effects of specific interest rate changes on net interest income to its basic one year gap model as a quantitative tool to measure the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market interest rates 
the bank also engages an outside consultant to prepare quarterly reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over projected periods 
these computations rely on various assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of the balance sheet
