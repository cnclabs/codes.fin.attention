item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis summarizes our financial condition and operating performance and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary our business we are an integrated media company that publishes and distributes advertising supported print and online consumer guides primarily for the apartment leasing and new home sectors of the residential real estate industry 
our guides are provided free of charge to end users 
in  we distributed approximately million of our print 
table of contents guides to approximately  us locations through our proprietary distribution network  distributech 
distributech also provides distribution services to more than  third party publications 
our principle digital assets include the websites associated with our print publications  as well as rentals 
com  the leading paid listings website for residential real estate rentals 
as a result of the divestiture of several of our businesses  the business that we have historically referred to as our consumer guides segment now constitutes all of our continuing operations 
our revenue is generated by our consumer guides businesses  primarily from advertising print and online and third party distribution 
business trends and outlook the us is currently experiencing its worst downturn in the residential real estate industry in almost two decades  and we have little visibility as to the timing of any improvement in the new home sales sector or related credit markets 
the longer an economic downturn continues  the more likely it becomes that our customers may significantly reduce their marketing and advertising budgets overall  in specific markets  or both 
we expect that will be challenging for all of our businesses in many markets  but we are experiencing early indications of positive trends in the apartment leasing sector  where occupancy rates have fallen to more normalized levels in some markets 
however  we do not expect significant additional apartment inventory in  as construction levels remain low 
with respect to our rentals 
com business  we expect strong online competition to persist in  as we focus on improving site engineering and performance and driving traffic through search engine optimization 
we will continue to pursue and invest in growth opportunities for these businesses in a strategic and thoughtful manner  looking at initiatives such as online enhancements to our product portfolio and selective market expansion 
we expect weakness in the new home sales sector to continue and spread to additional markets in  and we intend to continue prudently managing our cost structure to operate our new homes division as efficiently as possible  which in this environment may include suspension of publications in a small number of markets  if conditions worsen  as we cultivate our client relationships to best position us for when this sector improves 
we anticipate weakness in distributech  driven primarily by lower revenue that will not offset higher retail display allowance expenses due to expansion of retail locations 
our distribution business continues to be impacted by lower revenue from customers who publish free publications  particularly those within the resale home sector who are scaling back or ceasing operations 
we do not publish any products for the resale home sector 
we will continue to focus on broadening our customer base and expanding our product and service offerings within this business 
we will also seek to optimize further our distribution network by eliminating select retail locations that are no longer cost effective 
transition plan we are in the process of relocating our corporate headquarters from new york to norcross  georgia  where our consumer guides business is based 
we expect to continue certain of our new york based functions and incur their associated costs through june summary consolidated results in  revenue was million  up as compared to million in in  operating expenses were million  up compared to million in in  operating income was million  down from million in net income was million in  including gain on sale of businesses  net of tax  of million  compared to million in  including gain on sale of businesses  net of tax  of million

our asset sales  debt redemption and investment in organic growth have facilitated our objective to become a better strategically focused company  while strengthening our balance sheet and improving liquidity 
as is more fully described under financing arrangements below  we have required debt repayments of million during we believe our liquidity  capital resources and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements  interest and principal payments on our debt and other anticipated expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have no significant required debt repayments until working capital consolidated working capital  which includes current maturities of long term debt  was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the sales of the enthusiast media segment  the outdoors group and the majority of the education segment during cash flow compared to net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to net cash generated from operating activities of million in this decrease was primarily due to the settlement during of numerous accrued expenses and other liabilities existing at december   including payroll  commissions and related employee benefits  retail display costs and allowances  rent and lease liabilities  circulation costs and deferred purchase price obligations  as well as cash paid for taxes

we purchased all of our outstanding shares subject to mandatory redemption during why we use the term free cash flow free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for additions to property  equipment and other  net  exclusive of acquisitions  and capital lease payments 
we believe that the use of free cash flow enables our chief operating decision maker  our president and ceo  to make decisions based on our cash resources 
we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it is considered to be an indicator of our liquidity  including our ability to reduce debt and make strategic investments 
free cash flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operating activities as determined in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
free cash flow  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since not all companies necessarily calculate free cash flow in an identical manner  and therefore  is not necessarily an accurate measure of comparison between companies

we also announced on march  that our board of directors had authorized a cash dividend of per share of common stock  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  we expect to pay this dividend out of our existing cash balance  including cash generated through the liquidation of the available for sale securities 
additionally  we currently expect that we will continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future  at the discretion of our board of directors  dependent on such factors as available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial and market conditions  future prospects for cash flow and such other factors as are deemed relevant by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no variable interest otherwise known as special purpose entities or off balance sheet debt  other than as related to operating leases in the ordinary course of business

under our bank credit facility and senior note agreements  we are allowed to designate certain businesses as unrestricted subsidiaries to the extent that the value of those businesses does not exceed the permitted amounts  as defined in these agreements 
we have designated certain of our businesses as unrestricted the unrestricted group  which represent primarily internet businesses  trademark and content licensing and service companies  new launches including traditional start ups  other properties under evaluation for turnaround or shutdown  and foreign subsidiaries

the guarantees are full  unconditional  and joint and several 
the unrestricted group does not guarantee the bank credit facilities or senior notes 
for purposes of determining compliance with certain financial covenants under our bank credit facility  the unrestricted group s results positive or negative are not reflected in the consolidated ebitda of the restricted group which  as defined in the bank credit facilities agreement  excludes losses of the unrestricted group  non cash charges and restructuring charges and is adjusted primarily for the trailing four quarters results of acquisitions and divestitures and estimated savings for acquired businesses

these intercompany arrangements afford strategic benefits across our properties and  in particular  enable the unrestricted group to utilize established brands and content  promote brand awareness  and increase traffic and revenue to the properties of the unrestricted group 
for our consolidated financial reporting  these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the calculation of our leverage ratio  as required under the bank credit facilities agreement for covenant purposes  is defined as our consolidated debt divided by the ebitda of the restricted group 
at december   this leverage ratio was approximately to  compared to to at december  
table of contents contingencies and other we are involved in ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
in the opinion of management  though the ultimate outcome of these matters could be material to operating results in any given reporting period  there is no pending legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our long term results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position 
as of and for the year ended december   none of our officers or directors have been granted loans by us  nor have we guaranteed any obligations of such persons 
workplace learning in  we sold substantially all of the assets of workplace learning for the assumption of ongoing liabilities  while retaining a secondary liability as the assignor of the building and satellite time leases 
we received a third party guaranty of up to million against those lease obligations to reimburse us for lease payments made the guaranty 
in the first half of  we made payments on behalf of workplace learning pursuant to our secondary liability 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a liability for the fair value of the lease payments  net of sublease income  related to our secondary liability on the lease payments 
at that time  we also recorded a receivable of million for the amount due from the third party guarantor for the lease payments 
as a result of recording the receivable and liability during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million to discontinued operations 
in the second half of  we commenced a lawsuit to collect on the guaranty 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was not probable that the third party would remit payment  as required under the guaranty  and we fully reserved for the million receivable with a charge to discontinued operations as of december  we continue to exercise all available legal remedies against the third party guarantor and to fulfill our secondary obligation regarding the workplace learning leases 
at december   we have recorded a total liability of million for the fair value of the future lease payments  net of estimated sublease income  in the consolidated balance sheet 
indemnifications we are a party to contracts in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties but usually excludes any liabilities caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would trigger a liability under the indemnities 
additionally  in connection with the sale of assets and the divestiture of businesses  we may agree to indemnify the buyer and related parties for certain losses or liabilities incurred by the buyer with respect to i the representations and warranties made by us to the buyer in connection with the sale and ii liabilities related to the pre closing operations of the assets sold 
indemnities related to pre closing operations generally include tax liabilities and other liabilities not assumed by the buyer in the transaction 
indemnities related to the pre closing operations of sold assets normally do not represent additional liabilities to us but simply serve to protect the buyer from potential liability associated with our obligations existing at the time of the sale 
as with any liability  we have previously accrued for those pre closing obligations that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
we have not accrued any additional amounts as a result of indemnities which result from asset sales and divestitures 
should circumstances change  increasing the likelihood of payments related to a specific indemnity  we will accrue a liability when future payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the significant accounting policies  outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  are integral to an understanding of management s discussion and analysis 
the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of the results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made 
these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we base some of our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  gaap allows or requires many assets and liabilities to be accounted for at fair value  which is defined to be the price at which an asset or liability would be valued in an open market transaction 
gaap also requires that certain assets be assessed for impairment based on fair value 
in cases where active markets do not exist  as discussed below  modeling or other techniques may be required to estimate fair value 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements  and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period to period in the future 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this management s discussion and analysis 
goodwill impairment testing 
goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test  at least annually 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from an entity s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  we must test  at a reporting unit level  goodwill for impairment and have established october as the annual impairment testing date 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management 
our assets and liabilities are assigned to reporting units to the extent that they are employed in or are considered a liability related to the operations of the reporting unit and are considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is conducted by calculating the present value of expected cash flows of the reporting unit  which begins with management s forecast of earnings in the subsequent fiscal year 
a growth factor is applied to estimate earnings in the four years following that 
a discount factor  approximating our weighted average cost of capital  is then applied to the five years of forecasted cash flows plus an expected residual value to determine the present value 
the resulting present value is compared to the recorded equity of the reporting unit 
as long as the present value is greater  there is no impairment to goodwill 
in the annual assessment for  there was no indicated impairment to goodwill 
while we believe all assumptions utilized in our assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in actual earnings and the growth rate of future earnings  the effective tax rate and our weighted average cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
the most sensitive of these assumptions is future earnings 
based on the assessment for impairment  a decline in the amount of future earnings would not result in an indicated goodwill impairment 
long lived assets 
we must review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
those events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized eg  when a decision is made to dispose of an asset and certain other criteria are met  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset and a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the 
table of contents use of an asset 
when such a review is conducted  we use an estimate of undiscounted cash flows  which are derived from our historical experience and long term business plans  over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability 
if the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences ie  amounts that are recognized as income or deducted as expenses at different times for gaap and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets also arise from benefits recorded from nols ie  amounts representing losses for tax purposes that may be utilized in future years to offset taxable income 
a net deferred tax asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized within a relatively short period  generally no more than three years 
the valuation allowance must be sufficient to reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded as increases or decreases in income tax expense 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character eg  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 
there are four possible sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback year s if carryback is permitted under the tax law  and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to  for example accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards  or change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss 
evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and  possibly  from year to year 
to the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary  other sources need not be considered 
consideration of each source is required  however  to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets 
after consideration of the available evidence  a valuation allowance  if warranted  is established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that  in order to be recognized  tax benefits must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in evaluating the ability to realize deferred tax assets  including nols  and any need for a valuation allowance it is necessary to first consider the recognition threshold for uncertain tax positions and reduce the deferred tax assets by any required fin reserve 
at december   we had aggregate federal nols of approximately million  which are available to reduce future taxable income through in addition  we have significant state and local nols in various jurisdictions in which we and or our subsidiaries file income tax returns 
these state and local nols expire over various periods based on applicable state and local regulations 
the federal  state and local nols are the single largest component of our net deferred tax asset 
additionally  since amortization of tax deductible goodwill and trademarks ceased for gaap purposes on january   we expect that deferred tax liabilities will arise each quarter because the taxable temporary differences related to the amortization of these assets are not expected to 
table of contents reverse prior to the expiration period of our deductible temporary differences unless the related assets are sold or an impairment of the assets is recorded 
consequently  we continue to record a valuation allowance in excess of our net deferred tax assets to the extent the difference between the book and tax basis of indefinite lived intangible assets is not expected to reverse during the nol period 
based on the available evidence at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
to the extent that we develop a pattern of producing positive net income in the future  our nols may be available to reduce taxable income  which may allow our valuation allowance to be adjusted downward 
the utilization of such nols  however  may be subject to certain limitations under tax laws 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we elected the modified prospective transition method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the modified prospective transition method requires recognition of compensation expense from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employees awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  using the prospective method 
the most commonly granted form of stock based compensation has been stock options 
the fair value of stock options is determined using an option pricing model that takes into account certain assumptions  including the exercise price  which is the stock price at the grant date  the expected life of the grant  the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected dividends on the stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the grant 
the fair value of a stock option estimated at the grant date is not subsequently adjusted for changes in the price of the underlying stock or its volatility  the life of the grant  dividends on the stock or the risk free interest rate 
generally  changes in the assumptions will have the following impact on the fair value of stock option awards assumption impact on fair value exercise price increased price lower fair value decreased price higher fair value expected life of grant increased life higher fair value decreased life lower fair value volatility of underlying stock increased volatility higher fair value decreased volatility lower fair value expected dividends higher dividends lower fair value lower dividends higher fair value risk free interest rate higher rate lower fair value lower rate higher fair value 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of losses in our accounts receivable resulting from our customers failure to make required payments 
we continually monitor collections from customers and the age of outstanding balances 
each of our business units provides for estimated credit losses based on historical analysis of the propensity of their customer base to make required payments 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on overdue accounts and  upon collection of any amounts previously written off  reverse the write off 
if future payments by our customers were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts 
provision for restructuring costs 
reserves for restructuring costs are estimated costs resulting from our plans and actions to integrate the company and consolidate certain back office functions 
examples include severance  and the cost of the termination of real estate leases and the related write off of leasehold improvements 
if the future payments of these costs were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves 
divestiture reserves 
reserves for estimated obligations relating to divestitures may arise as a result of the sale of certain titles or business units 
these reserves are established for such items that we remain liable for after the sale is completed and are recorded at the time of the divestiture as part of the gain or loss on the sale of the divested asset or business 
examples include stay bonuses for key personnel  severance  taxes and working capital adjustments 
if the future payments for such items differ from its estimates  there could be a change in the determination of the gain or loss on sale

impact of inflation and other costs our largest exposure to inflation relates to the cost of paper 
our paper expense decreased approximately during compared to the cost of paper was stable during and the first half of paper prices increased approximately in the third quarter of and approximately in the fourth quarter of overall  our paper expense decreased approximately during compared to we anticipate additional increases in both paper prices and paper expense in the first quarter of and have taken steps to mitigate these increases by purchasing in advance 
seasonality our operations are minimally seasonal in nature 
the majority of our sales comprise contracts with a duration of months or longer 
we experience modest seasonality in our single unit real estate listing as that business declines in the winter months 
this business represents a relatively small part of the total consumer guides business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
at december   of our borrowings  excluding capital leases  were variable rate 
additionally  we were party to four interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  all of which were designated in hedging relationships against the variability of future cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with our term b loan facility

for variable rate instruments  we have indicated the applicable variable rate index 
the fair value of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks at december  and and actual fair values may differ from these estimates 
we periodically evaluate our exposure to interest rates and maintain a mixture of fixed rate and variable rate obligations

based on our variable rate obligations outstanding at december   including the impact of derivative financial instruments designated in hedging relationships against variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate on our term loan b facility  each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately million 
such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 

table of contents we have entered into fixed rate debt that at december   had an outstanding balance of million at face value  and a fair value of million 
based on our fixed rate debt obligations outstanding at december   a basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed rate debt by less than million 
such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level and rate of fixed rate debt and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period
