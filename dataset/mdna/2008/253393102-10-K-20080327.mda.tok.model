liquidity and capital resources the following discussion has been updated to reflect the effects of the corrections to the company s fiscal and consolidated statements of cash flows described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item herein 
our primary capital requirements are for working capital  capital improvements and to support expansion plans  as well as for various investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements 
the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows fiscal year ended february  february  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  with the pre christmas inventory increase being the largest 
in the fourth quarter  inventory levels are reduced in connection with christmas sales and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces significantly positive cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million in to million  which consists primarily of higher net income of million and an increase in the change in assets and liabilities of million primarily due to lower income tax payments made in compared to changes in assets and liabilities the primary factors contributing to the increase in the change in assets and liabilities were the change in income taxes payable and deferred construction allowances  partially offset by an increase in the change in inventory 
the increase in the change in income taxes payable was primarily due to lower income tax payments made during compared to due to the timing of estimated tax payments made in fiscal the company will make a larger tax payment in fiscal relating to fiscal than in previous years 
the increase in deferred 
table of contents construction allowances is primarily related to higher tenant allowances associated with our stores compared to the increase in the change in inventory was primarily due to higher store count 
the cash flows from operating the company s stores is a significant source of liquidity  and we expect will continue to be used in fiscal primarily to purchase inventory  make capital improvements and open new stores 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased by million  to million  primarily reflecting the payment for the purchase of golf galaxy of million  net of million cash acquired  and the payment for purchase of chick s sporting goods of million 
gross capital expenditures used million and sale leaseback transactions generated proceeds of million 
purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal relate primarily to the opening of new stores  information systems and administrative and distribution facilities 
the company generated proceeds from the sale and leaseback of property and equipment totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
during  we opened dick s stores and golf galaxy stores  as well as relocated one dick s store  compared to opening stores and the relocation of two stores during sale leaseback transactions covering store fixtures  buildings and information technology assets also have the effect of returning to the company cash previously invested in these assets 
there were no building sale leasebacks during  and financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million 
financing activities consisted of proceeds from construction allowances received prior to the completion of construction for stores where the company is deemed the owner during the construction period  transactions in the company s common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
as stock option grants are exercised  the company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction  however  the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted 
on july   the company entered into a fourth amendment to its second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement that  among other things  extended the maturity of the credit agreement from july to july  increased the potential aggregate revolving credit commitment  as defined in the credit agreement  from million to a potential commitment of million and reduced certain applicable interest rates and fees charged under the credit agreement 
the company s liquidity and capital needs have generally been met by cash from operating activities  the proceeds from the convertible notes and borrowings under the credit agreement  including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
borrowing availability under the credit agreement is generally limited to the lesser of of the company s eligible inventory or of the company s inventory s liquidation value  in each case net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding 
interest on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement currently accrues  at the company s option  at a rate based on either i the prime corporate lending rate or ii the libor rate plus to based on the level of total borrowings during the prior three months 
the credit agreement s term expires july  there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement as of february  or february  total remaining borrowing capacity  after subtracting letters of credit as of february  and february  was million and million  respectively 
the credit agreement contains restrictions regarding the company s and related subsidiaries ability  among other things  to merge  consolidate or acquire non subsidiary entities  to incur certain specified types of indebtedness or liens in excess of certain specified amounts  to pay cash dividends or make distributions on the company s stock  to make certain investments or loans to other parties  or to engage in certain lending  borrowing or other commercial transactions with subsidiaries  affiliates or employees 
under the credit agreement  the company may be obligated to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to in certain circumstances 
the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by interests in substantially all of the company s personal property excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures 
as of february   the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
cash requirements in  other than normal operating expenses  are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures related to the addition of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  enhanced information 
table of contents technology and improved distribution infrastructure  including our atlanta distribution center 
currently  the company plans to open new dick s stores  ten new golf galaxy stores  and relocate one dick s store during fiscal while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized  the company expects capital expenditures  net of deferred construction allowances and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  to be approximately million in  including golf galaxy and chick s capital expenditure requirements 
the company believes that cash flows generated from operations and funds available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements through fiscal other new business opportunities or store expansion rates substantially in excess of those presently planned may require additional funding 
in february  the company completed a private offering of million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of of the issue price payable semi annually on august th and february th of each year until february  after february   the notes do not pay cash interest  but the initial principal amount of the notes will accrete daily at an original issue discount rate of per year  until maturity on february   when a holder will receive  per note 
subject to the company s obligations to pay cash for a certain portion of the notes and its right  if it elects  to pay all amounts due under the notes in cash as more fully described below  the notes are convertible into the company s common stock upon the occurrence of certain events at the election of the holder in each of the first fiscal quarters following their issuance when the price per share of the company s common stock calculated for a certain period of time exceeds per share 
this conversion threshold trigger price permitting the notes to be converted by the holders has been met and the notes are eligible and will remain convertible for so long as they remain outstanding 
upon conversion of a note  the company is obligated to pay cash for each  of face amount of a note equal to the lesser of i the accreted principal amount the sum of the initial issue price of per  face amount and the accrued original issue discount as of the conversion date no original issue discount occurs until  and ii the product of a the number of shares of the company s common stock into which the note otherwise would have been converted if no cash payment were made by the company ie shares per  face amount  multiplied by b the average of the closing per share sale price on the fifteen consecutive trading days commencing on the fourth trading day after the conversion date 
in addition  the company at its election has the ability to pay cash or deliver shares for any balance shares due under the notes 
the number of balance shares is equal to the number of shares of common stock into which a note otherwise would be converted if no cash payment were made by the company  less the accreted principal amount the sum of the initial issue price of and the accrued original issue discount as of the conversion date of  divided by the average sale price the average of the closing per share sale price on the fifteen consecutive trading days commencing on the fourth trading day after the conversion date of a share of common stock 
all such calculations are controlled by and governed by the promissory note under which the notes are issued and the indenture  as amended  governing the notes 
if the number of balance shares is a positive number  the company has the option to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock for the balance shares by electing for each full balance share for which the company has chosen to deliver cash to pay cash in an amount equal to the average sale price of a share of common stock 
the notes will mature on february   unless earlier converted or repurchased 
the company may redeem the notes at any time on or after february   at its option  at a redemption price equal to the sum of the issue price  accreted original issue discount and any accrued cash interest  if any 
concurrently  with the sale of the notes  the company purchased a bond hedge designed to mitigate the potential dilution to stockholders from the conversion of the notes 
under the five year term of the bond hedge  one of the initial purchasers the counterparty will deliver to the company upon a conversion of the bonds a number of shares of common stock based on the extent to which the then market price exceeds per share 
the aggregate number of shares that the company could be obligated to issue upon conversion of the notes is  shares of common stock 
the cost of the purchased bond hedge was partially offset by the sale of warrants to acquire up to  shares of the common stock to the counterparty with whom the company entered into the bond hedge 
the warrants are exercisable by the counterparty in year five at a price of per share 
the warrants may be settled at the company s option through a net share settlement or a net cash settlement  either of which would be based on the extent to which the then market price exceeds per share 
the net effect of the bond hedge and the warrants is to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes if the company elects a net share settlement 
there would be dilution impact from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the then market price per share of the common stock exceeds per share at the time of conversion 

table of contents the company s common stock price has triggered an optional conversion right with respect to the notes 
based on the current price of the company s common stock  the company believes that if the notes were currently converted there would not be any dilutive effect on the company s estimated outstanding number of shares as a result of the notes or the warrants 
however  as the convertible notes remain outstanding in the future  depending on the price of the company s common stock  the notes may have dilutive effect and increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding beyond that which we estimate or may estimate in the future 
if the trading price in our common stock exceeds per share  we may incur dilution as a result of the notes and or the warrants and further increases in our common stock price may cause us to have to increase the number of shares outstanding and impact our earnings per share calculation 
at this time  we would not anticipate that the outstanding notes will be converted currently and believe that our current estimate of outstanding shares for adequately addresses any impact of the notes and warrants during however  the estimate of the number of shares outstanding and the estimates of the dilutive impact of the notes and warrants is based on current circumstances and is forward looking and only a prediction 
we also believe that to the extent the notes convertibility feature remains in the money  a holder would elect to convert at some point in the future or at redemption 
in addition  because a certain portion of the notes must be paid in cash and we may elect to pay for all amounts due under the notes in cash and we cannot predict the timing of such conversions  the timing of the conversions may impact our future liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  relate to operating lease obligations  future minimum guaranteed contractual payments and letters of credit 
the company has excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s material contractual obligations  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements in effect at february   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the company s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual obligations senior convertible notes see note capital lease obligations see note other long term debt see note interest payments operating lease obligations see note  b unrecognized tax benefits a naming rights and other marketing commitments see note future minimum guaranteed contractual payments see note total contractual obligations a excludes  of accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits as we can not reasonably estimate the timing of settlement 
b amounts include the direct lease obligations  excluding any taxes  insurance and other related expenses

the following table summarizes the company s other commercial commitments  including both on and off balance sheet arrangements  in effect at february  less than total year dollars in thousands other commercial commitments documentary letters of credit standby letters of credit total other commercial commitments the company expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 

table of contents outlook full year comparisons to fiscal based on an estimated million diluted shares outstanding  the company anticipates reporting consolidated earnings per diluted share of approximately 
this represents an approximate increase over earnings per diluted share for the full year of comparable store sales  which include dick s sporting goods and golf galaxy stores  are expected to be approximately flat to an increase of 
the golf galaxy stores will be included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in the first quarter of the comparable store sales calculation excludes the chick s sporting goods stores 
the company expects to open approximately new dick s sporting goods stores  ten new golf galaxy stores and relocate one dick s store in newly issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas  including the treatment of contingent consideration  preacquisition contingencies  transaction costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
in addition  under sfas r  changes in an acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal this standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis  including the treatment of any income tax adjustments related to past acquisitions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  however  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
the requirements of sfas are first effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
however  in february the fasb decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities until the subsequent year 
accordingly  our adoption of sfas is limited to financial assets and liabilities 
we do not believe that the initial adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  we are still in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore have not yet determined the impact that it will have on our financial statements upon full adoption 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant 
table of contents occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes  such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  economic conditions or business trends could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are treated as a reduction of inventory and reduce cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe provides a reasonable basis for determining fair value 
accordingly  we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of inventory  identifiable intangible assets such as tradenames  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill  indefinite lived and other finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company deems it necessary 
our evaluation for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of long lived assets and closed store reserves the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
based on an analysis of current and future store performance  management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores 
reserves are established when the company ceases to use the location for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
if the timing or amount of actual sublease income differs from estimated amounts  this could result in an increase or decrease in the related reserves 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
uncertain tax positions we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk will consist primarily of borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility 
the company s senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of february  and february  the impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the senior secured revolving credit facility would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
credit risk in february  the company sold million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due convertible notes 
in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into a five year convertible bond hedge and a five year separate warrant transaction with one of the initial purchasers the counterparty and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of the convertible bond hedge and separate warrant transaction in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of the counterparty and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
