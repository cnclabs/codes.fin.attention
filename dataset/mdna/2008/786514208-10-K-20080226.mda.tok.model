vendor allowances totaled billion in both and and billion in vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories promotional allowances  slotting allowances and contract allowances

promotional allowances make up approximately three quarters of all allowances 
with promotional allowances  vendors pay safeway to promote their product 
the promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction  a feature in print ads  a feature in a safeway circular  or a preferred location in the store 
the promotions are typically one to two weeks long 
slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances typically less than of all allowances 
with slotting allowances  the vendor reimburses safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf 
safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period 
contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances 
under the typical contract allowance  a vendor pays safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability  as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
for example  a basis point increase in the company s discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
some of the many sources of uncertainty in the company s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels  medical fee schedules  medical utilization guidelines  vocation rehabilitation and apportionment 

table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries store closures safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
employee benefit plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
additional disclosures are also required 
safeway adopted sfas no 
as of december   as required 
the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note i to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other postretirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the combined weighted average discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended december   the average rate of return was approximately for us and for canadian pension assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions for safeway s pension plans are as follows dollars in millions united states canada percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase expected return on assets pt discount rate pt cash contributions  primarily in canada  to the company s pension plans are expected to total approximately million in and totaled million in  million in and million in safeway expects to fund future contributions to the company s pension plans with cash flow from operations

r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant 
the company determines fair value of such awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as a risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
goodwill safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
the factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows 
fair value is determined primarily by the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company methods 
income tax contingencies the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service as well as foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the company s effective tax rate and cash flows in future years
