item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our discussions for the fiscal years ending december  and december  refer to a week period 
our discussion for the fiscal year ending december  refers to a week period with the fifty third week falling in the fourth quarter 
as of december   we owned and operated  or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which were company owned and were operated under franchise agreements including one franchise owned restaurant managed by the company under a management agreement 
in fiscal  we plan to open between and new company owned red robin gourmet burger restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open between and new restaurants 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the casual dining restaurant industry has become more complex and challenging in recent years 
challenges include increased competition among casual dining restaurant chains for the guest s discretionary dining dollars  increasing labor and benefit costs  increased food costs  increased energy and petroleum based product prices  changes in the economy and increasing real estate and development costs to build new restaurants 
in light of these complexities and challenges  management has pursued a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on adding company owned restaurants and increasing sales at existing restaurants 
in addition  management is focused on managing restaurant operating costs  investment costs and building our corporate infrastructure to facilitate our long term growth expectations 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring or affecting us in franchise acquisitions 
we acquired franchised red robin restaurants in the state of california for million 
the cash purchase price was funded through borrowings under the company s credit facility 
as part of this acquisition  we also assumed management of an additional existing restaurant location managed restaurant  under a management services agreement 
the acquired restaurants are referred to collectively as the acquired restaurants 
these restaurants have been included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition or take over dates 
in addition  a charge of million related to the reacquisition of the existing franchise and development agreements of the acquired restaurants is reported as reacquired franchise costs in the consolidated statements of income 
these acquired restaurants  when combined with the franchised red robin restaurants we acquired in the third quarter acquired restaurants are collectively referred to as the acquired restaurants 
in january  we announced our intent to acquire franchised restaurants in wisconsin and minnesota  three in indiana and one in new jersey from our franchise partners in those states 
we expect to close these acquisitions in the second quarter of launch of national media advertising campaign 
we launched our first national media advertising campaign on cable television in april and on the internet in may we believe this national media campaign increased revenue in the second and third quarters of in both new and existing markets  expanded brand awareness as a national restaurant company and provided support for our efforts to enter new markets where our brand has less recognition 
the system wide cost of this national campaign was approximately million with approximately million contributed by the company to a national advertising fund into which our franchise partners also contributed 
the million was contributed by our restaurants through a contribution of restaurant revenue beginning in march approximately of this amount was diverted from historical marketing expenditures such as local area advertising and radio advertising 
the remaining  or million  was incremental expenditure over and levels 
in  we plan to increase our contributions to the national advertising fund to of restaurant revenue from both the company and franchise owned restaurants 
this will increase the national advertising campaign expenditure to approximately million to million 
new restaurant training initiatives 
our focus on the performance of new restaurants led to the development of a number of programs designed to normalize new restaurant performance faster 
as part of our first quarter restaurant openings  we initiated new training programs that focus on accelerating and measuring the proficiencies of each hourly team member 
we also added additional modules to our manager training programs to better prepare new managers for the challenging environment a new restaurant creates 
in support of this initiative  we incurred higher average pre opening costs per restaurant in as compared to and in addition  we incurred higher labor and travel costs soon after the openings to support these new initiatives 
we believe adding more trainers and more seasoned managers for each opening continuing in will result in near term pressure on our profit margins in exchange for higher retention of opening sales volumes and faster normalization of profits 
new restaurant openings 
during fiscal  we opened company owned restaurants 
for the weeks ended december   approximately of total non comparable restaurant operating weeks were from units operating in new markets compared to in the weeks of and in the weeks of new markets present operational challenges as we expand into markets where we have less brand recognition  a lower concentration of trained team members and generally higher operating costs 
in  our non comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes increased from and decreased from based on market studies we commissioned  we believe the national media advertising campaign and new restaurant training initiatives discussed above had a positive impact on our new restaurant sales results and brand awareness 
comparable restaurant sales 
for the weeks ended december   the restaurants in our current comparable base experienced a increase in sales for these same restaurants over last year 
increases in the average guest check contributed of the increase which was partially offset by a decrease in guest counts 
the comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes are impacted by both the year over year sales growth of the restaurants in the comparable base and the growing number of less mature restaurants comprising our comparable restaurant base 
historically  our less mature restaurants operate at a lower average weekly sales volume during the early years of operation 
as these restaurants enter the comparable restaurant base  the average weekly sales volumes for comparable restaurants could be negatively impacted until these less mature restaurants reach normalized volumes  which has taken an average of three years of operation 
managing restaurant operating costs 
for the weeks ended december   total restaurant operating costs represented of restaurant revenues as compared to for the weeks ended december  and for the weeks ended december  restaurant operating costs represent food and beverage expenses  labor and benefit expenses  occupancy expenses and other operating costs such as marketing  supplies  repairs and maintenance and utility expenses 
our operating costs are impacted by the initiatives discussed above to improve performance and maintain sales growth in our new and existing restaurants 
in addition  we continue to see increasing inflationary pressures on operating costs including minimum wage increases  commodity food price increases and energy price increases 
we expect that these upward price pressures will continue through in response to these cost pressures  we implemented a price increase of approximately in late august which we believe will help offset some of these cost pressures and we have an additional price increase of planned for late march unit data and comparable restaurant sales the following table details data pertaining to the number of restaurant for both company owned and franchise locations for the years indicated 
company owned beginning of period opened during period acquired from franchisees closed during period end of period franchised beginning of period opened during period sold or closed during period end of period total number of red robin restaurants between december  and february   we opened six additional company owned restaurants and our franchisees opened one additional franchise restaurants 
we expect to open between and company owned restaurants during we anticipate that our franchisees will open between and restaurants during results of operations operating results for each period presented below are expressed as a percentage of total revenues  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues weeks revenues restaurant franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs cost of sales labor includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively operating occupancy total restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization general and administrative includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively franchise development pre opening costs reacquired franchise costs legal settlement significant and unusual items  net includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively income from operations other income expense interest expense interest income total other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income certain percentage amounts in the table above do not sum due to rounding as well as the fact that restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues  as opposed to total revenues 
total revenues in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change restaurant revenue    franchise royalties and fees    rent revenue total revenues    average weekly sales volumes comparable restaurants    non comparable restaurants    acquired restaurants   acquired restaurants  at the beginning of the third quarter  the acquired restaurants entered into the comparable restaurant population 
from that time forward  we have included their average weekly sales volumes in the comparable restaurant category 
the average weekly sales volumes for the acquired restaurants for the weeks ended december  represents their average weekly sales for the weeks through the second quarter when they were still part of the acquired restaurant category 
the average weekly sales volumes for the weeks ended december  represents their performance for the weeks from the date of their acquisition through the fiscal year end 
represents the average weekly sales volumes for the weeks since their acquisition in restaurant revenue  which is comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or  from fiscal of this increase  million was attributable to increased revenue from our comparable restaurants  million was attributable to restaurant revenues from the acquired restaurants  million was attributable to the new company owned restaurants opened during  and million was attributable to the acquired restaurants  offset by a million decrease in revenue from non comparable restaurants opened during and the revenue growth in over was attributable to the growth in the number of non comparable restaurants  the acquired restaurants  and a increase in comparable restaurant revenues from the increase in comparable restaurant revenues in was driven by a increase in guest counts and a increase in the average check 
average weekly sales volumes represent the total restaurant revenue for a population of restaurants in both a comparable and non comparable category for each time period presented divided by the number of operating weeks in the period 
comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes include those restaurants that are in the comparable base at the end of each period presented 
at the end of fiscal  there were comparable restaurants compared to comparable restaurants at the end of non comparable restaurants presented include those restaurants that had not yet achieved the five full quarters of operations during the periods presented 
at the end of fiscal  there were non comparable restaurants versus at the end of fiscal fluctuations in average weekly sales volumes for comparable restaurants reflect the effect of same store sales changes as well as the performance of new restaurants entering the comparable base during the period 
the increase in average comparable restaurant weekly sales in fiscal was primarily the result of the acquired restaurants entering into the comparable base during the last half of the year and by higher average guest checks  partially offset by decreased guest counts in addition to less mature restaurants entering the comparable restaurant base since the end of fiscal growth in restaurant revenue is expected to continue as we intend to open between and new restaurants in as well as realize a full year of revenue from our acquired restaurants 
we also expect that our expanded national media campaign will result in increased restaurant revenue 
franchise royalties and fees  which consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees  increased from the year over year increase in franchise royalties and fees is primarily attributable to the restaurants opened by our franchisees in  partially offset by the respective million and  reduction in franchise royalties from the and acquired restaurants 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales increased for us restaurants and for canadian restaurants in the year ended december  franchise royalties and fees for increased due primarily to the franchised restaurants opened during and the restaurants opened in  offset by the reduction in franchise fees from the acquired restaurants for the last half of the year

we expect to see an increase in labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues during  compared to  primarily due to state minimum wage increases 
in  labor costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased primarily due to increases related to hourly and salaried labor costs as a percentage of revenue in our non comparable restaurants as well as approximately  of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the increase in operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues is due to contributions of of restaurant revenues made to the national advertising fund beginning in april offset by a of restaurant revenue reduction of historical marketing expense for local advertising such as radio 
incremental costs of our national advertising campaign are expected to increase operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue in as we increase our contribution of revenue to national advertising from to 
in  operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased primarily due to higher energy expenses 
the higher energy costs were driven by increased rates charged to our restaurants as well as increased usage which resulted from severe weather in our northwest and southwest operations during supplies expense also reflects higher petroleum based materials costs  fuel surcharges and transportation costs that began to increase our base supply costs in occupancy in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change occupancy    as a percent of restaurant revenues occupancy costs include fixed rents  percentage rents  common area maintenance charges  real estate and personal property taxes  general liability insurance and other property costs 
our occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant revenues as we leverage our fixed costs 
as a percentage of restaurant revenues  occupancy costs remained flat over as higher fixed rents and higher real estate and property taxes were offset by decreases for general insurance 
occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue for were comparable to with modest decreases in insurance and taxes somewhat offset by increases in percentage rent 
depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization    as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased in due to increased depreciation and amortization for tangible and intangible assets related to the acquired restaurants

components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  office rent  professional and consulting fees and marketing costs 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues for remained flat compared to primarily due to decreased non advertising related marketing expenses and leverage from fixed costs such as salaries and compensation expense offset by increased professional and consulting fees 
generally  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase from quarter to quarter during but to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased over primarily due to stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r 
total stock compensation expense was million or of total revenues

franchise development expenses decreased in primarily due to reduced headcount and leveraged expenses of our franchise team to support the opening of franchise restaurants partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our leadership conference 
we anticipate that franchise development cost will continue to be leveraged against increased revenues in franchise development expenses in increased over primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our leadership conference partially offset by efficiencies and leveraged expenses of our franchise team to support the opening of franchise restaurants 
pre opening costs in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change pre opening costs    as a percent of total revenues average per restaurant pre opening costs pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of labor  hiring and training the initial work force for our new restaurants  travel expenses for our training teams  the cost of food and beverages used in training  marketing costs  lease costs incurred prior to opening and other direct costs related to the opening of new restaurants 
pre opening costs for  and reflect the opening of  and new restaurants  respectively 
average per restaurant pre opening costs represent total costs incurred for those restaurants that opened for business during the periods presented 
the increase in the average per restaurant pre opening costs reflects higher training expenses for our new training programs 
this increased training is designed to accelerate the development of proficiencies of each hourly team member to improve productivity and normalize operations of our new restaurants sooner than what we had experienced in the performance of restaurants opened prior to we expect that pre opening costs will continue to increase in as we open between and new restaurants  including many in new markets 
the increases in our average pre opening costs per restaurant over reflects an increase in lease costs incurred prior to opening 
these increased lease costs are driven by the number of restaurants built on leased land versus restaurants built on purchased land 
our new restaurants are weighted more heavily to leased land than our restaurant openings 
reacquired franchise costs as a result of the acquisition of the acquired restaurants  we incurred a total charge of million during the year ended december   relating to reacquired franchise rights of approximately million in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf 
for the acquired restaurants  we incurred a total charge of million for the year ended december  relating to reacquired franchise rights of approximately million 
eitf requires that a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting relationship be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
the million and million charge for and  respectively  reflects the lower royalty rates applicable to certain of the acquired restaurants compared to a standard royalty rate the company would receive under the company s current royalty agreements 
see note  acquisition of red robin franchised restaurants  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition and related charge 
legal settlement during  we recorded a million charge related to the agreement to settle several legal proceedings against us in the state of california 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these proceedings and the related charge 
significant and unusual items  net on august   we announced the retirement of our then current chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the resignation of our then current senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
these management changes followed an internal investigation commenced during the third quarter of by a special committee of the board of directors relating to use of chartered aircraft and travel and entertainment expenses 
the special committee  which retained independent counsel to conduct the investigation  identified various expenses by our former chairman  president and chief executive officer since that were inconsistent with company policies or that lacked sufficient documentation 
on august   our former chairman  president and chief executive officer entered into a restitution agreement with us  and on august   we received million as reimbursement for these expenses 
in the third quarter of  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin  we recorded a non cash stock based compensation expense of million 
this expense relates to previously modified and exercised stock options of our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and former senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
interest expense interest expense in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense in was higher due to higher outstanding borrowings under our credit facility partially offset by a lower average interest rate of versus in interest expense in was higher than in due to higher borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and a higher average interest rate of versus in this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest incurred in the construction of our new restaurants during we believe interest expense will decrease in due to a combination of an expected lower average interest rates and a pay down on our credit facility through scheduled amortization payments due under our term loan credit facility 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to more favorable tax credits and state apportionment factors resulting from a shift in our income to states with lower tax rates 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
net cash inflows were provided from operating activities  net borrowings under our credit agreement  and to a lesser extent proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options and stock purchases 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants and to reduce borrowings under our credit agreement 
cash outflows resulted from the purchase of the acquired restaurants and construction of new restaurants 
financial condition 
the company and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
credit facility 
on june   we amended and restated our existing credit facility to provide a more flexible capital structure and facilitate our growth plans 
the amended credit agreement provides for more favorable borrowing rates  allows us the ability to repurchase shares of our capital stock within certain limits and to continue to finance restaurant construction  fund franchise restaurant acquisitions  and to be used for working capital and general corporate requirements 
the amended credit facility is comprised of i a million credit facility maturing on june   and ii a million term loan maturing on june   both with rates initially based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus to depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the amended credit agreement also allows us  subject to lender participation  to increase the credit facility by up to an additional million in the future 
as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the amended credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the amended credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock of subsidiaries of the company and most real properties that we own 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
we borrowed million under the term loan facility and used the proceeds to repay all borrowings under the prior credit facility  to pay related transaction fees and expenses and to fund the acquisition of the acquired restaurants as described in note  acquisition of red robin franchised restaurants  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we also retained the net proceeds of the term loan to fund the acquisition of the two restaurants on july  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments that began september  and end on the maturity date of the term loan 
at december   we had million of borrowings under the credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of million 
loan origination costs associated with the amended credit facility and the net outstanding balance of costs related to the original and subsequent amendments to the credit facility are million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   due to additional borrowings to construct new restaurants  finance our franchise acquisition  and acquire other assets  offset by payments made on capital lease obligations 
during the third quarter  we paid our outstanding collateralized notes payable balance of million with funds provided through the term loan facility 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    other non current liabilities   uncertain tax positions long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our credit agreement including interest of million based on a average interest rate 
outstanding letters of credit of approximately million are included in the year total 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
other non current liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant bonuses for long term incentive plans  franchise deposits and vendor deposits 
the total liability for uncertain tax positions under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  at december  was approximately  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments relating to  of non current unrecognized tax benefits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fiscal  compared with fiscal  includes higher expenditures for new restaurants as well as increases in facility improvements 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with was primarily due to expenditures for new restaurant construction and remodeling 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million 
in addition to the construction of to new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements as well as expanding our corporate infrastructure to support our growth model 
we have also announced plans to acquire franchisee owned restaurants with an estimated purchase price of approximately million 
we will fund the acquisition of these restaurants using borrowings from our existing credit facility 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for growing infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital to acquire franchise restaurants including the restaurants discussed above 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and the revolving bank credit facility as amended in june based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the current year  due primarily to increased labor costs  higher energy costs  higher costs for certain supplies and petroleum based products  higher costs for materials and labor related to construction of our new restaurants and commodity prices for certain foods we purchase at market rates 
uncertainties related to higher costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life for owned assets and the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease for leased assets 
changes in circumstances  such as changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy  can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where management determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation and amortization expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the expected lease term for assets related to properties under lease and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact management s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets and amortized intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
there were no asset impairment charges during fiscal  or goodwill 
we also evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock 
we completed our most recent goodwill impairment test in december and determined that there was no impairment losses related to goodwill 
in the event that business conditions change and our market value were to drop significantly below year end levels  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to a write down of the value of goodwill 
at december   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas r 
under sfas r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
the adoption of sfas r will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 sfas 
sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas is effective for us on a prospective basis for business combinations with an acquisition date beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year as of december   we did not have any minority interests 
the adoption of sfas will not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
sfas allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates 
such election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is typically irrevocable once elected 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and early application is allowed under certain circumstances 
we have determined that we will not elect the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value allowable under sfas  and therefore  we believe that this interpretation will not have a material impact  if any  on our financial position
