our employees 
as of december   nabors employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately  were employed by unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe our relationship with our employees generally is good 
certain rig employees in argentina and australia are represented by collective bargaining units 
seasonality 
our canadian and alaskan drilling and workover operations are subject to seasonal variations as a result of weather conditions and generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second calendar quarter of each year 
seasonality does not have a material impact on the remaining portions of our business 
our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in our canadian and alaskan operations 
research and development 
research and development constitutes a growing part of our overall business 
the effective use of technology is critical to the maintenance of our competitive position within the drilling industry 
as a result of the importance of technology to our business  we expect to continue to develop technology internally or to acquire technology through strategic acquisitions 
industry competitive conditions 
to a large degree  nabors businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities by our customers and could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see part i item a 
risk factors fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and nabors revenues  cash flows and profitability 
our industry remains competitive 
historically  the number of rigs has exceeded demand in many of our markets  resulting in strong price competition 
more recently  as a result of improved demand for drilling services driven by a sustained high level of commodity prices  supply and demand have been in balance in most of our markets  with demand actually exceeding supply in some of our markets 
this economic reality has resulted in an increase in rates being charged for rigs across our north american  offshore and international markets 
furthermore  over the last three years  the dramatic increase in rates along with our customers willingness to enter into firm three year commitments has resulted in our building of new rigs in significant quantities for the first time in over years 
however  as many existing rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis  competition based on price for both existing and new rigs still exists across all of our markets 
the land drilling  workover and well servicing market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of rigs and market participants 
in all of our geographic market areas  we believe price and availability and condition of equipment are the most significant factors in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job 
other factors include the availability of trained personnel possessing the required specialized skills  the overall quality of service and safety record  and domestically  the ability to offer ancillary services 

table of contents increasingly  as the market requires additional rigs and as a result of new build capacity  the ability to deliver rigs within certain timeframes is becoming a competitive factor 
in international markets  experience in operating in certain environments and customer alliances  also have been factors in the selection of nabors 
certain competitors are present in more than one of nabors operating regions  although no one competitor operates in all of these areas 
in the us lower states  there are several hundred competitors with national  regional or local rig operations 
in domestic land workover and well servicing  we compete with basic energy services  inc and key energy services  inc 
and with numerous other competitors having smaller regional or local rig operations 
in canada and offshore  nabors competes with many firms of varying size  several of which have more significant operations in those areas than nabors 
internationally  nabors competes directly with various contractors at each location where it operates 
nabors believes that the market for land drilling  workover and well servicing contracts will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future 
our other operating segments represent a relatively smaller part of our business  and we have numerous competitors in each area 
our canrig subsidiary is one of the four major manufacturers of top drives 
its largest competitors are national oilwell varco  tesco and mh pyramid 
epoch s largest competitors in the manufacture of rig instrumentation systems are pason and national oilwell varco s totco subsidiary 
mudlogging services are provided by a number of entities that serve the oil and gas industry on a regional basis 
epoch competes for mudlogging customers with baker hughes  sperry sun  diversified  and stratagraph in the gulf coast region  california and alaska 
in the us lower states  there are hundreds of rig transportation companies  and there are at least three or four that compete with peak usa in each of its operating regions 
in alaska  peak oilfield services principally competes with alaska petroleum contractors for road  pad and pipeline maintenance  and is one of many drill site and road construction companies  the largest of which is veco corporation  and alaska interstate construction principally competes with wilder construction company and cruz construction company for the construction of roads  bridges  dams  drill sites and other facility sites 
our business strategy 
since  with the installation of our current management team  nabors has adhered to a consistent strategy aimed at positioning our company to grow and prosper in good times and to mitigate adverse effects during periods of poor market conditions 
we have maintained a financial posture that allows us to capitalize on market weakness and strength by adding to our business base  thereby enhancing our upside potential 
the principal elements of our strategy have been to maintain flexibility to respond to changing conditions 
maintain a conservative and flexible balance sheet 
build cost effectively a base of premium assets 
build and maintain low operating costs through economies of scale 
develop and maintain long term  mutually attractive relationships with key customers and vendors 
build a diverse business in long term  sustainable and worthwhile geographic markets 
recognize and seize opportunities as they arise 
continually improve safety  quality and efficiency 
implement leading edge technology where cost effective to do so 
build shareholder value by an expansion of our oil and gas reserves and production 
our business strategy is designed to allow us to grow and remain profitable in any market environment 
the major developments in our business in the past three years illustrate our implementation of this strategy and its continuing success 
specifically  we have taken advantage of the robust rig market to obtain a high volume of contracts for newly constructed rigs 
a large proportion of these rigs are subject to long term contracts with creditworthy customers with the most significant impact occurring in our international operations 
this will not only expand our operations with the latest state of the art rigs  which should better weather downturns in market activity  but eventually replace the oldest least capable rigs in our existing fleet 

table of contents acquisitions and divestitures 
we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower states  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in many of the major oil  gas and geothermal markets in the world 
at the beginning of  our fleet consisted of actively marketed land drilling rigs in canada  alaska and in various international markets 
today  nabors worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consist of approximately land drilling rigs  approximately domestic and international land workover and well servicing rigs  offshore platform rigs  jack up units  barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
this growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions 
although nabors continues to examine opportunities  there can be no assurance that attractive rigs or other acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in making such acquisitions in the future 
on january   we completed an acquisition of alberta ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of airborne energy solutions ltd  through the purchase of all common shares outstanding for cash for a total purchase price of cdn 
million us million 
in addition  we assumed debt  net of working capital  totaling approximately cdn 
million us million 
nabors blue sky ltd 
formerly alberta ltd 
owns helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and owns and operates a fleet of heliportable well service equipment 
the purchase price has been allocated based on final valuations of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and resulted in goodwill of approximately us million 
on may   we completed an acquisition of pragma drilling equipment ltd 
s business  which manufactures catwalks  iron roughnecks and other related oilfield equipment  through an asset purchase consisting primarily of intellectual property for a total purchase price of cdn 
million us million 
the purchase price has been allocated based on final valuations of the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and resulted in goodwill of approximately us million 
on august   we sold our sea mar business which had previously been included in other operating segments 
the assets included offshore supply vessels and certain related assets  including a right under a vessel construction contract 
the operating results of this business for all periods presented are accounted for as a discontinued operation in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income 
from time to time  we may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business  if it is economically advantageous for us to do so 
environmental compliance 
nabors does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position  capital spending or earnings during nabors believes it is in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations  and the cost of such compliance is not material to the business or financial condition of nabors 
for a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to nabors operations  see below under part i item a 
risk factors changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect nabors results of operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating nabors 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues  cash flows and profitability our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas exploration and production 
both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices affect the level of such activity 
oil and gas prices and  therefore  the level of drilling  exploration and production activity can be volatile 
worldwide military  political and economic events  including initiatives by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  may affect both the demand for  and the supply of  oil and gas 
weather conditions  governmental regulation both in the united states and elsewhere  levels of consumer demand  the availability of pipeline capacity  and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and gas 
we believe that any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would depress the level of exploration and production activity 
this would likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and profitability 
lower oil and gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate  renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts  affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn could trigger a write down for accounting purposes  affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel  and affect our ability to obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business 
there can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and gas and oilfield services industries 
we operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity  which may adversely affect our results of operations the oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive 
contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
many drilling  workover and well servicing rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and provided market conditions warrant  which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area 
in many markets in which we operate  the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs  resulting in price competition 
most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
the land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors 
the nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that  if not insured or indemnified against  could adversely affect our results of operations our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling  workover and well servicing industries  including blowouts  cratering  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing  grounding  collision  damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks of war  civil disturbances or other political events 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
the occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations  could result in substantial losses 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks  or  even if available  that it will be adequate or that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future  so as to make such insurance prohibitive 
it is possible that we will face continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurance renewals  our premiums and deductibles will be higher  and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible 
we may choose to increase the levels of deductibles and thus assume a greater degree of risk from time to time in order to minimize the overall cost to the company 

table of contents the profitability of our international operations could be adversely affected by war  civil disturbance or political or economic turmoil we derive a significant portion of our business from international markets  including major operations in canada  south america  mexico  the caribbean  the middle east  the far east  russia and africa 
these operations are subject to various risks  including the risk of war  civil disturbances and governmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
in certain countries  our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls 
in the international markets in which we operate  we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country  the imposition  application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain 
changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations the drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws  rules and regulations 
our cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 
for example  federal law imposes a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills 
as an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment  we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law 
in addition  our well servicing  workover and production services operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws  rules and regulations  including  without limitation  laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances  oilfield waste and other waste materials  the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells 
we generally require customers to contractually assume responsibility for compliance with environmental regulations 
however  we are not always successful in allocating to customers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that the customer will be financially able to bear those risks assumed 
we employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use consultants and to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts 
liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and are expected to continue to become more so 
violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial obligations  and in some cases injunctive relief 
such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries  property damage  and other costs and claims 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  also known as cercla or superfund  and related state laws and regulations  liability can be imposed jointly on the entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
under cercla  such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us 
for example  legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress which would reclassify certain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes  which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
if enacted  such legislation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making many wells and or oilfields uneconomical to operate 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  contains provisions specifying responsibility for removal costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto the adjoining shorelines 
in addition  the outer continental shelf lands act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites 
as a holding company  we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations 
table of contents we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries 
in order to meet our financial needs  we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries 
there can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans 
in addition  from time to time  our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict or prohibit such upstream payments to us 
there may also be adverse tax consequences associated with making dividend payments upstream 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since nabors does not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares 
however  we note that there have been recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment of dividends 
as a result  we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future 
because our option  warrant and convertible securities holders have a considerable number of common shares available for issuance and resale  significant issuances or resales in the future may adversely affect the market price of our common shares as of february   we had  authorized common shares  of which  shares were outstanding 
in addition   common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to option and employee benefit plans  and  shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures and zero coupon senior exchangeable notes 
in addition  up to  of our common shares could be issuable on exchange of the shares of nabors exchangeco canada inc we also may sell up to million of securities of various types in connection with a shelf registration statement declared effective on january  by the sec 
the sale  or availability for sale  of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of warrants or options and  where applicable  sales pursuant to rule or the conversion into common shares  or repurchase of debentures and notes using common shares  would be dilutive to existing security holders  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
provisions of our organizational documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium our board of directors is divided into three classes  with each class serving a staggered three year term 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue a significant amount of common shares and up to  preferred shares and to determine the price  rights including voting rights  conversion ratios  preferences and privileges of the preferred shares  in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares 
although we have no present plans to issue preferred shares  the classified board and our board s ability to issue additional preferred shares may discourage  delay or prevent changes in control of nabors that are not supported by our board  thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizing a possible premium on their shares 
in addition  the requirement in the indenture for our billion senior exchangeable notes due and series b of our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due to pay a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making a change in control of nabors more expensive 
we have a substantial amount of debt outstanding as of december   we have long term debt of approximately billion  including current maturities of million  and cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion  including million of long term investments and million in cash proceeds receivable from the sale of certain non marketable securities that is included in other current assets 
if either of our billion senior exchangeable notes or the million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes are exchanged or our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes are put to us  we believe that we have the ability to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligations that might arise upon exchange of these notes and that any cash payment due of this magnitude  in addition to our other cash obligations  will not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position 
we have a gross funded debt to capital ratio of and a net funded debt to capital ratio of the gross funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing funded debt by funded debt plus deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets plus capital 
funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt 
capital is defined as shareholders equity 
the net funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets plus capital 
net funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt reduced by the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
capital is

both of these ratios are methods for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
on february   nabors industries  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by nabors industries ltd 
see note subsequent event of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our ability to perform under new contracts and to grow our business as forecasted depends to a substantial degree on timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers the forecasted growth in the operating revenues and net income for our contract drilling subsidiaries depends to a substantial degree on the timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers as part of our recently expanded capital programs 
we can give no assurances that our suppliers will meet expected delivery schedules for delivery of these new rigs and equipment or that the new rigs and equipment will be free from defects 
delays in the delivery of new rigs and equipment and delays incurred in correcting any defects in such rigs and equipment could cause us to fail to meet our operating forecasts and could subject us to late delivery penalties under contracts with our customers 
we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our financial position  income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by us 
on september   nabors drilling international limited ndil  a wholly owned bermuda subsidiary of nabors  received a notice of assessment the notice from the mexican servicio de administracion tributaria the sat in connection with the audit of ndil s mexican branch for tax year the notice proposes to deny a depreciation expense deduction that relates to drilling rigs operating in mexico in  as well as a deduction for payments made to an affiliated company for the provision of labor services in mexico 
the amount assessed by the sat is approximately million including interest and penalties 
nabors and its tax advisors previously concluded that the deduction of said amounts was appropriate and more recently that the position of the sat lacks merit 
ndil s mexican branch took similar deductions for depreciation and labor expenses in   and it is likely that the sat will propose the disallowance of these deductions upon audit of ndil s mexican branch s   and tax years 
proposed tax legislation could mitigate or eliminate the benefits of our reorganization as a bermuda company various bills have been introduced in congress which could reduce or eliminate the tax benefits associated with our reorganization as a bermuda company 
legislation enacted by congress in provides that a corporation that reorganized in a foreign jurisdiction on or after march  shall be treated as a domestic corporation for united states federal income tax purposes 
nabors reorganization was completed june  there have been and we expect that there may continue to be legislation proposed by congress from time to time applicable to certain companies that completed such reorganizations on or after march  which  if enacted  could limit or eliminate the tax benefits associated with our reorganization 
because we cannot predict whether legislation will ultimately be adopted  no assurance can be given that the tax benefits associated with our reorganization will ultimately accrue to the benefit of the company and its shareholders 
it is possible that future changes to the tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings resulting from our reorganization 
legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents we are from time to time subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations which include employment  tort  intellectual property and other claims  and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions 
we also are subject to complaints or allegations from former  current or prospective employees from time to time  alleging violations of employment related laws 
lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our financial results could be affected by changes in the value of our investment portfolio we invest our excess cash in a variety of investment vehicles  many of which are subject to fluctuations resulting from a variety of economic factors or factors associated with a particular investment  including without limitation  overall declines in the equity markets  currency and interest rate fluctuations  volatility in the credit markets  exposures related to concentrations of investments in a particular fund or investment  exposures related to hedges of financial positions  and the performance of particular fund or investment managers 
as a result  events or developments which negatively affect the value of our investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the loss of key executives could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success the successful execution of our strategies central to our future success will depend  in part  on a few of our key executive officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with our chairman and chief executive officer  mr

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world 
we conduct oil  gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the us lower states  alaska  canada  south america  mexico  the caribbean  the middle east  the far east  russia and africa 
nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the united states and canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the united states and multiple international markets 
to further supplement and complement our primary business  we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services  including engineering  construction  
table of contents maintenance  well logging  directional drilling  rig instrumentation  data collection and other support services  in selected domestic and international markets 
we offer logistics services for onshore drilling in canada using helicopter and fixed winged aircraft 
we manufacture and lease or sell top drives for a broad range of drilling applications  directional drilling systems  rig instrumentation and data collection equipment  and rig reporting software 
we also invest in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities worldwide 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  workover and well servicing operations  on land and offshore 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in a category labeled oil and gas for segment reporting purposes 
our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled other operating segments for segment reporting purposes 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
the primary determinate of customer spending is the degree of their cash flow and earnings which are largely determined by natural gas prices in our us lower land drilling  canadian and us offshore gulf of mexico operations  while oil prices are the primary determinate in our alaskan  international and us land well servicing operations 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price million cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended december  totaled billion and million per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of billion  or  compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended december  totaled billion and billion per diluted share  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our adjusted income derived from operating activities from to related primarily to our us lower land drilling  canada drilling and well servicing  and our us well servicing operations  where activity levels have decreased despite slightly higher natural gas prices and higher oil prices 
operating results were further negatively impacted by higher levels of depreciation expense due to our capital expenditures 
partially offsetting the decreases in our adjusted income derived from operating activities were the increases in operating results from our international operations and to a lesser extent by our alaska operations  driven by continuing high oil prices 
in addition  our net income and earnings per share for has decreased compared to as a result of investment net losses during only partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower number of average shares outstanding 
the increase in operating results from to resulted from higher revenues realized by essentially all of our operating segments 
revenues increased as a result of higher average dayrates and activity levels during compared to this increase in average dayrates and activity reflects an increase in demand for our services in these markets during  which resulted from continuing higher expenditures by our customers for drilling and workover services as a result of historically high oil and natural gas prices throughout our operating results for are expected to approximate the levels realized during we expect our international operations to show substantial increases resulting from the deployment of additional rigs under long term contracts and the renewal of existing contracts at higher current market rates 
however  our north american natural gas driven operations are expected to decrease 
in our us lower land drilling operations  we expect a significant number of expiring term contracts for older rigs to rollover in at lower margins 
these decreases should be partially offset by the remaining new rig deployments at higher margins and improved margins of the previously deployed new rigs 
we expect our canadian operations to decrease as a result of the depressed market conditions there

represents the elimination of inter segment transactions 
adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense from operating revenues and then adding earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 
such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria  including adjusted income derived from operating activities  because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company

additionally  the decrease in operating results is due to higher drilling rig operating costs  including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activity  which is reflected in the increase in rig years from to average dayrates and activity levels improved during and as a result of an increase in demand for drilling services  which resulted primarily from continuing higher price levels for natural gas during us land well servicing 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig hours operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from to primarily due to year over year higher average dayrates  supported by the sustained level of high oil prices and an expansion of our geographic market through nine additional service centers from our capital spending program 
higher average dayrates were partially offset by lower rig utilization 
the decrease in adjusted income derived from operating activities from to reflects lower rig utilization  higher operating costs  higher sg a costs and higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from a year over year increase in average dayrates and from higher well servicing hours 
this increase in dayrates and well servicing hours resulted from higher customer demand for our services in a number of markets in which we operate  which was driven by a sustained level of higher oil prices

our operating results for were further negatively impacted by proposed changes to the alberta royalty and tax regime causing customers to assess the impact of such changes 
the continued strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar positively impacted operating results in when translated to us dollar equivalents but negatively impacted demand for our services as much of our customers revenue is denominated in us dollars while their costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
additionally  operating results were negatively impacted by increased operating expenses  including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and hourly rates for our canadian drilling and well servicing operations  respectively  and from year over year increases in drilling activity 
average dayrates and hourly rates and drilling activity levels improved as a result of increased demand for our services in this market  which was driven by increased commodity prices from to the increases in drilling activity are reflected in the year over year increases in rig years 
well servicing hours decreased from to as lower natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of reduced the demand for completion work on gas wells

the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities     n m the percentage is so large that it is not meaningful 
the increase in our operating results from to was primarily a result of year over year increases in income attributable to earnings related to production payment contracts and gains totaling million recognized on the sale of certain properties during additionally  operating results were higher year over year due to increases in production and increases in oil  gas and natural gas liquid prices 
these increases to operating results were partially offset by a million increase in depletion expense and approximately million in net losses from the first reserve joint ventures which commenced operations in  as well as higher seismic costs and workover expenses compared to the prior year 
the higher depletion expense resulted from increased units of production depletion and impairment charges  related to higher costs and lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells 
the decrease in our operating results from to primarily resulted from a reduction in production stemming from the payout of one investment with el paso corporation in late and the reversion of our net profits interest to an overriding royalty interest 
the net impact of changes in commodity prices from to further contributed to the decrease in operating results from to additionally  we incurred higher seismic costs and work over expenses as compared to prior period and also recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties totaling approximately million that was recorded as depletion expense 
this impairment resulted from lower than expected performance of certain asset groups 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain on the sale of certain leasehold interests in the first quarter of other operating segments these operations include our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations 
the results of operations for these operating segments are as follows year ended december  increase in thousands  except percentages to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income loss derived from operating activities the increase in our operating results from to and from to primarily resulted from increased sales of top drives driven by the strengthening of the oil market and increased equipment sales associated with the acquisition of pragma drilling equipment ltd

results for construction and logistics services decreased during compared to due to lower demand for our services and increased in compared to due to higher demand for our services 

table of contents discontinued operations during the third quarter of  we sold our sea mar business which had previously been included in other operating segments for a cash purchase price of million 
the assets included offshore supply vessels and certain related assets  including a right under a vessel construction contract

the increase in our operating results from to primarily resulted from increased margins for our marine transportation and supply services driven by higher average dayrates and higher utilization  which was primarily driven by an improvement in the offshore drilling market that resulted in increased demand for our services 
other financial information general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues general and administrative expenses increased from to and from to primarily as a result of increases in wages and burden for a majority of our operating segments compared to the prior year period  which primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees required to support the increase in activity levels and from higher wages  and increased corporate compensation expense  which primarily resulted from higher bonuses and non cash compensation expenses recorded for stock options and restricted stock grants during each sequential year 
during  the increase was also impacted by million additional compensation expense recorded during the fourth quarter relating to the review of employee stock option granting practices performed by the company as more fully described in note depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to depreciation and amortization expense depletion expense depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from to and from to as a result of depreciation on capital expenditures made throughout  and from our expanded capital expenditure program commenced in early depletion expense 
depletion expense increased from to as a result of increased units of production depletion and impairment charges resulting from higher costs and lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells 
depletion expense decreased from to as a result of lower oil and gas production due to the payout of the el paso red river program in late these decreases were partially offset due to increases in depletion expense on non el paso properties due to impairments of approximately million 
the impairments resulted from lower than expected performance of certain asset groups 

table of contents interest expense year ended december  increase in thousands  except percentages to to interest expense interest expense increased from to and from to as a result of the additional interest expense related to the may issuance of the billion senior exchangeable notes due this increase was partially offset by interest expense reductions resulting from the redemption of or million of our zero coupon convertible senior debentures due on february  these zero coupon notes accreted at a rate of per annum 
see further discussion of these transactions in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii  item investment loss income year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to investment loss income investment loss income during was a net loss of million compared to income of million during the prior year 
the current year loss reflected a net loss of million from the portion of our long term investments comprised of our actively managed funds inclusive of substantial gains from sales of our marketable equity securities 
investment income from our short term investments was approximately million during and slightly lower than primarily due to a combination of decreasing interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
investment income increased from to as a result of higher interest income earned on investments in cash and short term and long term investments due to rising interest rates and a higher average investment balance related to the proceeds from the issuance of the billion senior exchangeable notes due received in may the proceeds from the note issuance were reduced by approximately billion  which represents the cost of the purchase of the call options and the buy back of our stock  net of the sale of warrants 
in addition  earnings on our long term investments increased during as compared to the prior year period 
the increase was partially reduced in compared to the prior year periods by reduced gains realized from the sale of equity securities

income tax rate year ended december  effective income tax rate from continuing operations 
table of contents the decrease in our effective income tax rate from to is a direct result of the reversal of certain tax reserves during in the amount of million  a decrease in tax expense of approximately million resulting from a reduction in canadian tax rates  and a decrease in the proportion of income generated in the us versus the international jurisdictions in which we operate 
income generated in the us is generally taxed at a higher rate than international jurisdictions 
during  a tax expense relating to the redemption of common shares held by a foreign parent of a us based nabors subsidiary in the amount of million increased taxes while a reduction in canadian tax rates decreased tax expense in the amount of million 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our financial position  income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
in october  the us congress passed and the president signed into law the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act did not impact the corporate reorganization completed by nabors effective june   that made us a foreign entity 
it is possible that future changes to tax laws including tax treaties could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as a result of our corporate reorganization  depending on any responsive action taken by nabors 
we expect our effective tax rate during to be in the range 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax 
one of the most volatile factors in this determination is the relative proportion of our income being recognized in high versus low tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities  and could also materially affect our cash flows 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  purchases and sales of investments  issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion during compared to net cash provided by operating activities of billion during during and  net income was increased for non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  depletion  and deferred income tax expense and was reduced for changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities totaled billion during compared to net cash used for investing activities of billion during during and  cash was primarily used for capital expenditures

future cash requirements as of december   we had long term debt  including current maturities  of billion and cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion  including million of long term investments and million in cash proceeds receivable from the sale of certain non marketable securities that is included in other current assets 
the cash proceeds were received during january 
nabors delaware s billion senior exchangeable notes due provide that upon an exchange of these notes  it will be required to pay holders of the notes  in lieu of common shares  cash up to the principal amount of the notes and our common shares for any amount exceeding the principal amount of the notes required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the note indentures 
the notes cannot be exchanged until the price of our shares exceeds approximately for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter  or during the five business days immediately following any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that period was less than of the product of the sale price of nabors common shares and the then applicable exchange rate  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions set forth in the indenture 
the million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due provide that upon an exchange of these notes  we will be required to pay holders of the notes  in lieu of common shares  cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  at our option  consideration in the form of either cash or our common shares for any amount above the principal amount of the notes required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the note indentures 
the notes cannot be exchanged until the price of our shares exceeds for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous calendar quarter  or with respect to all calendar quarters beginning on or after july   on such last trading day  or subject to certain exceptions  during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that period was less than of the product of the sale price of nabors common shares and the then applicable exchange rate  or if nabors delaware calls the notes for redemption  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the note indenture 
the notes can be put to us on june   june  and june  for a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
accordingly  as our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes can be put to us on june   the outstanding principal amount of these notes of million were reclassified from long term debt to current liabilities in our balance sheet as of june  if these notes are not put to us on june   the notes will be reclassified back to long term debt in our balance sheet at that time 
see a detailed discussion of the terms of these notes included in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in part ii  item as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million  primarily for rig related enhancing  construction and sustaining capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures over the next twelve months  including these outstanding purchase commitments  are currently expected to be approximately 
billion  including currently planned rig related enhancing  construction and sustaining capital expenditures 
this amount could change significantly based on market conditions and new business opportunities 
the level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next twelve months represent a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned 
these programs have resulted in an expansion in the number of drilling and well servicing rigs that we own and operate and consist primarily of land drilling and well servicing rigs 
on september   we entered into an agreement with first reserve corporation to form a new joint venture  nfr energy llc  to invest in oil and gas exploration opportunities worldwide 
first reserve corporation is a private equity firm specializing in the energy industry 
each party initially made a non binding commitment to fund its proportionate share of billion in equity 
during  joint venture operations in the us  canada  and international areas  were divided among three separate joint venture entities  including nfr energy llc nfr  stone mountain ventures partnership stone mountain  and remora energy international lp remora  respectively

each joint venture pursues development and exploration projects with both existing customers of ours and with other operators in a variety of forms including operated and non operated working interests  joint ventures  farm outs and acquisitions 
as of december   we had made capital contributions of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to nfr  stone mountain and remora 
we have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations 
several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of our common shares 
future acquisitions may be paid for using existing cash or issuance of debt or nabors shares 
such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors

in july  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
this program supersedes and cancels our previous share repurchase program 
through december   approximately million of our common shares had been repurchased under this program 
as of december   we had million of shares that still may be purchased under the july share repurchase program

financial condition and sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents investments of billion including million of long term investments and million in cash proceeds receivable from the sale of certain non marketable securities that is included in other current assets and working capital of million 
this compares to cash and cash equivalents and investments of billion including million of long term investments and working capital of billion as of december  our gross funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and as of december  our net funded debt to capital ratio was as of december  and  respectively 
the gross funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing funded debt by funded debt plus deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets plus capital 
funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt 
capital is defined as shareholders equity 
the net funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets plus capital 
net funded debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and long term debt reduced by the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
capital is defined as shareholders equity 
both of these ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital 
long term investments consist of investments in overseas funds investing primarily in a variety of public and private us and non us securities including asset backed securities and mortgage backed securities  global structured asset securitizations  whole loan mortgages  and participations in whole loans and whole loan mortgages 
these investments are classified as non marketable  because they do not have published fair values 
our interest coverage ratio from continuing operations was as of december   compared to as of december  the interest coverage ratio is a trailing twelve month computation of the sum of income from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense less investment income and then dividing by interest expense 
this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense 
we have four letter of credit facilities with various banks as of december  availability and borrowings under our credit facilities as of december  are as follows in thousands credit available letters of credit outstanding remaining availability we have a shelf registration statement on file with the sec to allow us to offer  from time to time  up to million in debt securities  guarantees of debt securities  preferred shares  depository shares  common shares  share purchase contracts  share purchase units and warrants 
we currently have not issued any securities registered under this registration statement 
our current cash and cash equivalents  investments and projected cash flows generated from current operations are expected to more than adequately finance our purchase commitments  our debt service requirements  and all other expected cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  as discussed under future cash requirements above  the billion senior exchangeable notes and million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes can be exchanged when the price of our shares exceeds and  respectively  for the required periods of time  resulting in our payment of the principal amount of the notes  or billion and million  respectively  in cash 
our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes can be put to us on june  resulting in our payment of cash or we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after june   at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus 
table of contents contingent interest  if any  and accordingly  the outstanding principal amount of these notes of million was reclassified from long term debt to current liabilities in our balance sheet as of june  on february   nabors industries  inc nabors delaware  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due with registration rights  which are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
the issue of senior notes was resold by a placement agent to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act of  as amended securities act 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually on february and august of each year  beginning august  we intend to use the remaining proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt 
on february   the market price for our shares closed at 
if the market price threshold of for our billion senior exchangeable notes or for our million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes was exceeded and the notes were exchanged or if the holders of the million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes require us to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes on june   the required cash payment could have a significant impact on our level of cash and cash equivalents and investments available to meet our other cash obligations 
management believes that the holders of these notes would not be likely to exchange the notes as it would be more economically beneficial to them if they sold the notes on the open market 
however  there can be no assurance that the holders would not exchange the notes 
if either of the notes were exchanged or the million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes are put to us on june   management believes  in addition to our current cash and cash equivalents and investments  that we have the ability to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligations that might arise upon exchange of these notes and that any cash payment due of this magnitude  in addition to our other cash obligations  will not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position 
our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by dominion bond rating service dbrs  fitch ratings  moody s investor service and standard poor s  which are currently a  a  a and bbb  respectively  and our historical ability to access those markets as needed

off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees we are a party to certain transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as off balance sheet arrangements that could have a material future effect on our financial position  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
the most significant of these off balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations in which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties 
certain of these agreements serve as guarantees  including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds 
in addition  we have provided indemnifications to certain third parties which serve as guarantees 
these guarantees include indemnification provided by nabors to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers 
we are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees 
management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote

on november   we made an offer to eligible employees to amend certain outstanding options granted under the nabors industries  inc employee stock plan and the nabors industries  inc employee stock plan to increase the exercise price per option to the fair market value of a common share of nabors on each option s measurement date for financial accounting purposes and to make to eligible employees a cash payment equal to the difference between the new exercise price per share of the amended option and the original exercise price per share  multiplied by the number of unexercised eligible options 
as a result of the tender offer  we cancelled options with a fair value of million  replaced with a new award of options with a fair value of million and paid million in cash 
this resulted in million of additional compensation expense

related party transactions pursuant to their employment agreements  nabors and its chairman and chief executive officer  deputy chairman  president and chief operating officer  and certain other key employees entered into split dollar life insurance agreements pursuant to which we paid a portion of the premiums under life insurance policies with respect to these individuals and  in certain instances  members of their families 
under these agreements  we are reimbursed for such premiums upon the occurrence of specified events  including the death of an insured individual 
any recovery of premiums paid by nabors could potentially be limited to the cash surrender value of these policies under certain circumstances 
as such  the values of these policies are recorded at their respective cash surrender values in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have made premium payments to date totaling million related to these policies 
the cash surrender value of these policies of approximately million and million is included in other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive 
property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december   and depreciation constituted of our total costs and other deductions for the year ended december  
table of contents depreciation for our primary operating assets  drilling and workover rigs  is calculated based on the units of production method over an approximate  day period  with the exception of our jack up rigs which are depreciated over an  day period  after provision for salvage value 
when our drilling and workover rigs are not operating  a depreciation charge is provided using the straight line method over an assumed depreciable life of years  with the exception of our jack up rigs  where a year day depreciable life is used 
depreciation on our buildings  well servicing rigs  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment  marine transportation and supply vessels  aircraft equipment  and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value buildings to years  well servicing rigs to years  marine transportation and supply vessels to years  aircraft equipment to years  oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment to years 
these depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property  plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets 
periodically  we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets 
estimation of these items requires significant management judgment 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property  plant and equipment are critical 
there have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets  changes in technology or other factors that indicate that these lives do not continue to be appropriate 
accordingly  for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property  plant and equipment  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation  or the methodology applied 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed above  the drilling  workover and well servicing industries are very capital intensive  which is evident in the fact that our property  plant and equipment represented of our total assets as of december  other long lived assets subject to impairment consist primarily of goodwill  which represented of our total assets as of december  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable 
such determination requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review in order to determine the future cash flows associated with the asset or  in the case of goodwill  our reporting units 
these long term forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions  technological advances in the industry  and changes in regulations governing the industry 
significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
as the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long lived assets is subject to significant management judgment and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income  management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long lived assets are critical 
assumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows 
given the nature of the evaluation of future cash flows and the application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
income taxes deferred taxes represent a substantial liability for nabors 
for financial reporting purposes  management determines our current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
currently payable taxes represent the liability related to our income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the 
table of contents balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on investments and derivative financial instruments are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
the changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
management must make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management has considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates are made for each tax jurisdiction in which we operate as the calculation of deferred taxes is completed at that level 
further  under us federal tax law  the amount and availability of loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests applicable to nabors and our subsidiaries 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or effectively lost upon certain changes in ownership 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
these loss carryforwards are also considered in our calculation of taxes for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
additionally  we record reserves for uncertain tax positions which are subject to a significant level of management judgment related to the ultimate resolution of those tax positions 
accordingly  management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to our results of operations 
we have received notifications from the irs on various matters as a result of irs audits of certain tax years
