item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the more detailed information including our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results and business plans discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
restatement the years ended december   and the period from inception august  to december  have been restated due to an error in the classification and calculation for stock based compensation for non employee consultants 
our business activities we are engaged  through subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we are a participant  in the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
we initiated these activities in through december   our activities have been undertaken in locations where we and our joint venture participants have been granted exploration rights pursuant to production sharing contracts pscs entered into with the government of india goi 
we have entered into ten pscs 
each psc relates to a separate drilling block onshore or offshore india and each provides for multi year and multi phase exploration and drilling activities 
exploration and development activities pursuant to the terms of these agreements are expected to continue throughout at december   we have not reported any proved reserves of oil or natural gas 
statements of operations oil and gas operations our oil and gas exploration activities commenced at august  we have not since our inception earned any revenues from these operations

toc years ended december  and during the year ended december   we had expenses of  compared with expenses of  during the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities and additions to the office infrastructure 
our general and administrative expenses increased to  from  these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  rent and office costs  insurance  american stock exchange listing and filing fees and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods 
these stock based compensation costs decreased to  from  for the same period in the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses is a result of compensation costs of  related to the september  extension of the expiry date of the compensation options and the related compensation option warrants issued in a private sale of our securities in from september  to june  which were not incurred in the same period in the balance of the increase is due to the addition of an extra staff member in the calgary office offset by the decrease in stock based compensation costs 
our consulting fees decreased to  during the year ended december  from  in the prior year 
this change is mostly attributable to the decrease in compensation costs for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being a recovery of  versus an expense of  for the year ended december  these consulting fees include   paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  who is employed as a consultant to us  and other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
legal fees increased from approximately  in to about  in in addition  costs associated with initiating the modeling  testing and documenting internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act were incurred during the year along with the work required to restate our financial statements for the years ending december    and this resulted in an increase from  for the year ending december   to  in the fees paid to our auditors and accountants for additional work incurred during the year ending december as compared to our other expenses and income during the year ended december  resulted in income of  versus  for the same period in included in other expenses and income is a foreign exchange gain  compared to a loss in of  interest income increased  being  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in  this improvement is directly related to a small increase in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well an increase in our invested cash balances resulting from our private sale of securities in june  during the year ended december   depreciation increased slightly to  from  during the year ended december  reflecting the increase in our general and administrative expenses and professional fees due to the increase in our overall oil and gas exploration activities  as offset by the increase in interest income and a decrease in our consulting fees  our net loss amounted to  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the same period in we capitalized overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs were  as compared to  during the year ended december  the difference of  is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  to  versus  for the same period in page 
toc years ended december  and during the year ended december   we had expenses of  compared with expenses of  during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities  with commensurate additions to the office infrastructure and the initial year of accounting for stock based compensation expense  offset by a substantial decrease in consulting fees due to a decrease in our stock based compensation for non employee consultants 
our general and administrative expenses increased to  from  of this increase   reflects the adoption of fas r pursuant to which we are required to recognize compensation costs for stock based arrangements with employees effective january  these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  rent and office costs  insurance  american stock exchange listing and filing fees and transfer agent fees and services 
our consulting fees decreased to  during the year ended december  from  in the prior year 
this decrease is mainly attributable to the decrease in stock based compensation for non employee consultants for the year ending december  of  to  for the year ending december  further  these consulting fees include   paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy and other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
in addition  costs associated with initiating the modeling  testing and documenting internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act were incurred during the latter part of the year 
this resulted in an increase of  in the fees paid to our auditors  accountants and legal counsel for additional work incurred during the year ending december as compared to during the year ended december   depreciation decreased slightly to  from  during the year ended december  our other expenses and income during the year ended december  resulted in income of  versus  for the same period in included in other expenses and income is a foreign exchange loss of  compared to a gain in of during the previous year ended december   we recovered fees and costs of  resulting from services provided and billed out to gspc and a gain on the sale of computer equipment of  no such expense recoveries or asset dispositions occurred during the year ended december  our increase in interest income to  from  for the year ended december  is a result of the significant increase in the size of our cash balances we held during a full year in as compared to a partial year in as well as an increase in the us prime rate 
net loss for the year ended december  was  versus a net loss of  in this decrease was mainly attributable to the reduction in our consulting fees as a result of a reduction in our compensation costs for the stock based compensation arrangements with non employee consultants coupled with the increase in interest earned during the most recent year  net of our increased costs as a result of our increased scale of participation in oil and gas exploration activities 
we capitalized overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs were  as compared to  during the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to the capitalized stock based compensation for employees of  which is recognized for the first time in  as a consequence of our adoption of fas r effective january   with the balance of the increase being consistent with the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities

toc liquidity at december   our cash and cash equivalents were  december  
the majority of these funds are being held as us funds  of which  is held in term deposits earning interest based on the us prime rate 
in addition to our cash balances  we will earn interest on our term deposits which we believe will significantly cover our administrative costs and overhead throughout we are unaware at this time of any material uncertainties that may affect our liquidity through march  we further believe at this time that the outcome of the kg cia dispute will not have a material effect on our liquidity 
we currently have no specific plans or arrangements to raise additional capital 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to maintain our current level of activities through the period ending march  years ended december  and during the year ended december   our overall position in cash and cash equivalents increased by  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of  these cash movements can be attributed to the following activities our net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  as compared to used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to the result of an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the year ended december  as compared to cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the year ended december  funds of  were used for exploration activities and  for the acquisition of property and equipment in as compared to  and  in this increase is consistent with our increased drilling costs in the cambay area as well as exploration costs incurred in bidding and evaluating new exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt 
in addition  we made a substantial investment in fixed assets  mainly for an office condominium in gandhinagar  india plus improvements which were completed during the third quarter at a total cost of approximately offsetting the increased investing activity in the year ended december  was a reduction in the requirement to supply bank guarantees  such that in the year ended december  outlays were reduced to  versus outlays for such instruments of  for the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work program mwp  and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
these investing outlays were also offset by a combined increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and prepaids and deposits of  in the year ended december  as compared to a combined net increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and prepaids and deposits of  in the same period of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to cash provided by financing activities of  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we completed the sale of  units of our securities at per unit for aggregate cash gross proceeds of  less share issuance costs of  relating to financing activities 
further  during the year ended december   cash of  was provided from the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options  as compared to cash of  from the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options and purchase warrants less share issuance costs of  page 
toc years ended december  and our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is mostly the result of an increase in our exploration activities net of our interest earned on our cash balances for the year ended december  as compared to cash used by investing activities during the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the year ended december  this increase is a result of the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities 
funds of  were used for exploration activities and  for the acquisition of property and equipment in as compared to  and  in these acquisitions included computer and office equipment totaling  plus a deposit on our office condominium in india of  as well we incurred  as our share of exploration costs related to our pscs for our oil and gas interests in india 
the increase in restricted cash of  represents additional term deposits we made in as compared to  in which are used as collateral for letters of credit given to the goi as minimum work commitment guarantees on a total of six exploration blocks at december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to cash provided in financing activities of  during the year ended december  this consisted of  from the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options and purchase warrants issued from our financing less share issuance costs of  at december   our cash and cash equivalents were  december  
the majority of these funds were held as us funds in our bank accounts and in term deposits earning interest based on the us prime rate 
capital resources we expect our exploration and development activities pursuant to the pscs we are a party to  and the related drilling activities in the exploration blocks that we hold an interest in  will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during the period april  to march   based on the current budgets  we anticipate drilling thirty six well which entails approximately four wells in the kg offshore block  three wells in the kg onshore block  twenty six wells in three of our cambay blocks mehsana  sanand miroli and ankleshwar and three wells in our rajasthan blocks 
further  we may drill approximately five wells on the tarapur block pending the outcome of the extension of phase iii requested of the goi 
in addition  we may seek to participate in joint ventures bidding for the award of further pscs for exploration blocks expected to be awarded by the goi in the future 
as of may   we have no specific plans to join with others in bidding for any specific pscs in india and elsewhere 
we expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority pi in the venture 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may seek to acquire minority pi s in exploration blocks where pscs have been heretofore awarded 
the acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals 
we may during the year seek to participate in joint venture bidding for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in other international countries  however  as of may   we have made no specific plans regarding such activities and have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to such activities 
depending upon the scope of our activities during the years and  we may require additional capital for the funding of our activities under the pscs we are currently a party to as well as support for our bidding for other pscs that may be awarded in india or elsewhere 
in addition  we may require additional funds for the possible acquisition of further minority participating interests in pscs in drilling blocks heretofore awarded and that we may hereafter propose to enter into in india and possibly elsewhere 
we believe it can be expected that our interest in further or additional pscs would be a participating interest 
as the holder of a participating interest in any such activities  it can be expected that we will be required to contribute capital to any such ventures in proportion to our percentage interest 
page 
toc as of may   the scope of any possible such activities has not been definitively established and  accordingly  we are unable to state the amount of any funds that may be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that if we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities 
as of may   we are unable to estimate the terms on which any such capital may be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet all our expenses and cash requirements estimated to be approximately m for the period ended march  for our present level of operations 
we do not expect to have any significant change in in our number of employees 
the kg offshore block and our carried interest agreement at december   gspc  the operator of the kg offshore block  has expended on exploration activities approximately million attributable to us under the cia as compared to million at december  of this amount  is for the account of rgm 
under the terms of the cia  geoglobal and rgm are carried by gspc for of all our share of any costs during the exploration phase on the kg offshore block prior to the start date of initial commercial production 
under the terms of the psc  gspc is committed to expend further funds for the exploration of and drilling on the kg offshore block 
preliminary estimates made in august were that these expenditures attributable to us will total approximately million over the year term of the psc 
additional drilling costs incurred in drilling to depths in excess of  meters versus shallower depths as originally anticipated  as well as the testing and completion costs of these wells  has resulted in our actual costs significantly exceeding our original budgeted expenditures 
the estimated annual budget for costs to be incurred by gspc for the twelve month period april  to march  attributable to us under the cia is approximately million 
of this amount  is for the account of rgm 
we are unable to estimate the amount of additional expenditures gspc will make attributable to us prior to the start date of initial commercial production under the cia or when  if ever  any commercial production will commence 
as provided in the cia  we will be required to bear the expenditures attributable to us after the start date of initial commercial production on the kg offshore block 
we will not realize cash flow from the kg offshore block until such time as the expenditures attributed to us  including those expenditures made for the account of rgm under the cia have been recovered by gspc from future production revenue 
under the terms of the cia  all of our proportionate share of capital costs for exploration and development activities must be repaid to gspc without interest over the projected production life or ten years  whichever is less

toc financial commitments under pscs arise under the terms of our pscs 
under these agreements  we are obligated to pay for our proportionate share of the multi year exploration expenses in fulfilling the work programs on the exploration blocks

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of our operations and our cash flows in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
property and equipment we follow the full cost method of accounting for its petroleum and natural gas operations 
upon the commencement of economic production quantities of petroleum and natural gas  depletion of our exploration costs in india included in property and equipment  will be provided on a country by country basis using the unit of production method based upon estimated proven petroleum and natural gas reserves 
the costs of acquiring and evaluating our unproven properties in india will not be depleted until it is determined whether or not proven reserves are attributable to the properties  the major development projects are completed  or impairment occurs 
to date we are currently in the development stage and have not yet found any commercial reserves in india 
we are continuing with our exploratory drilling programs in india and have no basis for impairment of the costs incurred to date 
page 
toc impairment of oil and gas properties we review the carrying values of our oil and gas interests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
if  upon review  the sum of the discounted after tax cash flows from proved reserves plus the market value of unproved properties is less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes  generally on a block by block basis 
the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available  or upon the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including estimates relating to the future development costs  pricing  production costs and associated production 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of the oil and gas interests 
asset retirement obligation legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets result from the acquisition  construction  development and normal use of the asset 
the company s asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the retirement of oil and gas properties and related production facilities  lines and other equipment used in the field operations 
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the estimated fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset 
this additional carrying amount is then depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability increases due to the passage of time based on the time value of money until the obligation is settled 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
stock based compensation we adopted fas r  using the modified prospective transition method on january  under this method  we are required to recognize compensation cost for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors based on their grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  such cost to be expensed over the compensations respective vesting periods 
for awards with graded vesting  in which portions of the award vest in different periods  we recognize compensation costs over the vesting periods for each separate vested tranche prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for share based compensation awards in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which generally resulted in no compensation expense for employee stock options with an exercise price greater than or equal to fair value on the date of grant 
we record the estimated fair value of the equity instrument expense of options granted to non employee consultants on the measurement date 
the company re measures the fair value of the unvested portion of stock based awards to non employee consultants  resulting in charges or credits to operations in periods when such re measurement results in differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price of the options that is greater than or less than the differences  if any  between the fair value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price of the options at their respective previous measurement dates 
stock based compensation for non employee consultants is expensed or capitalized based on the nature of the consultant s activities 
page 
toc inherent in determining the fair value of options are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for share compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as our expected stock price volatility  expected term of the options granted to employees and consultants  expected dividend yield  the expected risk free interest rate  the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted to employees  non employee directors and non employee consultants 
recent accounting standards fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued fas no

fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and is applicable beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact that fas will have on our consolidated financial statements and fas will be applied prospectively

the required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format  information about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements  counterparty credit risk  and the company s strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments

fas r retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
generally  fas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations completed on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of fas r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  provided that we do not undertake a significant acquisition or business combination
