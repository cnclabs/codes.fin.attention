overview of our business we are a maryland corporation incorporated on october   for the purpose of acquiring the fund and tml  raising capital in the offering and thereafter operating as an internally managed business development company  or bdc  under the investment company act of the fund is licensed as a small business investment company  or sbic  by the united states small business administration  or sba  and has also elected to be treated as a bdc 
the fund has invested primarily in debt instruments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lower middle market privately held companies located in the united states 
upon the consummation of the offering  we completed the formation transactions described in item of part i of this annual report  at which time the fund became our wholly owned subsidiary  and the former partners of the fund became our stockholders 
our business is to provide capital to lower middle market companies in the united states 
we define lower middle market companies as those with annual revenues between million and million 
we focus on investments in companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows  an established market position and a proven management team with a strong operating discipline 
our target portfolio company has annual revenues between million and million and annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  between million and million 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt securities secured by first and second lien security interests in portfolio company assets  coupled with equity interests 
our investments generally range from million to million per portfolio company 
in certain situations  we have partnered with other funds to provide larger financing commitments 
we generate revenues in the form of interest income  primarily from our investments in debt securities  loan origination and other fees and dividend income 
fees generated in connection with our debt investments are recognized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method or  in some cases  recognized as earned 
in addition  we generate revenue in the form of capital gains  if any  on warrants or other equity related securities that we acquire from our portfolio companies 
our debt investments generally have a term of between three and seven years and typically bear interest at fixed rates between and per annum 
certain of our debt investments have a form of interest  referred to as payment in kind  or pik  interest  that is not paid currently but that is accrued and added to the loan balance and paid at the end of the term 
in our negotiations with potential portfolio companies  we generally seek to minimize pik interest 
cash interest on our debt investments is generally payable monthly  however  some of our debt investments pay cash interest on a quarterly basis 
as of december  and december   the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding debt investments including pik interest was approximately and  respectively 
the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding investments including equity and equity linked investments was approximately and as of december  and december   respectively 
the fund is eligible to sell debentures guaranteed by the sba to the capital markets at favorable interest rates and invest these funds in portfolio companies 
we intend to continue to operate the fund as an sbic  subject to sba approval  and to utilize the proceeds of the sale of sba guaranteed debentures  referred to herein as sba leverage  to enhance returns to our stockholders

as a result of the offering and the formation transactions described in note to our financial statements  we are now an internally managed investment company and  on february   we began incurring general and administrative costs associated with employing our executive officers  key investment personnel and corporate professionals and other general corporate overhead costs 
in addition  we experienced an increase in general and administrative costs associated with being a publicly traded company  such as increased insurance  accounting  corporate governance and legal costs 
these increases in general and administrative costs were partially offset by a million decrease in management fees

during the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized appreciation in the amount of million  comprised of million of unrealized appreciation on two of our portfolio companies and the reclassification of an unrealized loss to a realized loss in the amount of million 
as a result of these events  our net increase in net assets from operations during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand  our available sba leverage and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows for the year ended december   we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million 
during that period  our operating activities used million in cash  and we generated million of cash from financing activities  consisting of i proceeds from our offering of million  ii proceeds from the issuance of sba guaranteed debentures of million and iii a decrease in deferred offering costs of million  partially offset by cash dividends paid of million  tax distributions to partners of million and financing fees paid to the sba of million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
for the year ended december   we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million 
during that period  we used million in cash to fund operating activities and we generated million of cash from financing activities  consisting of limited partner capital contributions in the amount of million offset by a cash distribution to limited partners in the amount of million and an increase in deferred offering costs of million 
we invested the entire million of cash from the limited partner capital contributions in new subordinated debt investments during as of december   all limited partners in the fund had fully funded their committed capital 
at december   we had million of cash on hand 
for the year ended december   we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million 
during that period  we used million in cash to fund operating activities and we generated million of cash from financing activities  consisting of borrowings under sba guaranteed debentures in the amount of million and limited partner capital contributions in the amount of million 
these amounts were offset by financing fees paid by us in the amount of million 
we invested the entire million of cash from financing activities in ten new investments during financing transactions due to the fund s status as a licensed sbic  the fund has the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the small business investment act and the sba rules applicable to sbics  an sbic or group of sbics under common control can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the sba in an amount up to twice the amount of its regulatory capital  which generally is the amount raised from private investors 
the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba issued by a single sbic as of december  is currently million which amount is subject to increase on an annual basis based on cost of living increases 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have a maturity of ten years  with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 

table of contents debentures issued prior to september were subject to pre payment penalties during their first five years 
those pre payment penalties no longer apply to debentures issued after september  with million of regulatory capital as of december   the fund has the current capacity to issue up to a total of million of sba guaranteed debentures  subject to the payment of a commitment fee to the sba on the amount of the commitment 
as of december   the fund had paid commitment fees for and had a commitment from the sba to issue a total of million of sba guaranteed debentures  of which million are outstanding as of december  on january   the sba approved an additional commitment to the fund in the amount of million  bringing the total commitment from the sba to approximately million 
in order to access the remaining million in borrowing capacity for which the fund is currently eligible  the fund would incur non refundable commitment fees of  in addition to the one time fee on the total commitment from the sba  the company also pays a one time fee on the amount of each debenture issued 
these fees are capitalized as deferred financing costs and are amortized over the term of the debt agreements using the effective interest method 
the weighted average interest rate for all sba guaranteed debentures as of december  was 
current market conditions the debt and equity capital markets in the united states have been severely impacted by significant write offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated bank loan market  among other things 
these events  along with the deterioration of the housing market  have led to worsening general economic conditions which have impacted the broader financial and credit markets and have reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular 
while we have capacity to issue additional sba guaranteed debentures as discussed above  we may not be able to access additional equity capital  which could result in the slowing of our origination activity during and beyond 
in the event that the united states economy enters into a protracted recession  it is possible that the results of some of the middle market companies similar to those in which we invest could experience deterioration  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
while we are not seeing signs of an overall  broad deterioration in our portfolio company results at this time  there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
as discussed below  we have engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us in our valuation process 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price of the exchange or securities market on which they are listed on the valuation date 
securities that are not traded on a public exchange or securities market but for which a limited market exists are valued at the indicative bid price offered on the 
table of contents valuation date 
as of december   none of the debt securities in our portfolio were publicly traded or had a limited market  and there was a limited market for one of the equity securities we owned 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded and for which a market does not exist are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
in making the good faith determination of the value of these securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  and pik interest  if any 
management evaluates our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
management also consults with portfolio company senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development and other operational issues 
in addition  when evaluating equity securities of private companies  we consider valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice  including discounted cash flow of the expected sale price in the future  valuation of the securities based on recent sales in comparable transactions  and a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
unrealized appreciation or depreciation on portfolio investments are recorded as increases or decreases in investments on the balance sheets and are separately reflected on the statements of operations in determining net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations 
we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security at the time of the valuation 
to estimate the current sale price of the security  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such security  pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer  such as merger or debt restructuring  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  the security s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and or sales to third parties of similar securities  the issuer s ability to make payments and the type of collateral  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 

table of contents duff phelps  llc duff phelps  an independent valuation firm  provides third party valuation consulting services to us  which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested duff phelps to perform hereinafter referred to as the procedures 
we generally request duff phelps to perform the procedures on each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies  at least once in the twelve month period subsequent to the initial investment 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is not cost effective  and as a result is not in our shareholders best interest  to request duff phelps to perform the procedures on one or more portfolio companies 
such instances include  but are not limited to  situations where the fair value of our investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to our total investment portfolio 
as of september   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in portfolio companies comprising of the total investments at fair value as of september  as of december   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in six portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of december  for the quarter ended march   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of march  for the quarter ended june   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of june  for the quarter ended september   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in five portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of september  for the quarter ended december   we asked duff phelps to perform the procedures on investments in six portfolio companies comprising approximately of the total investments at fair value exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter as of december  upon completion of the procedures  duff phelps concluded that the fair value  as determined by the board of directors  of those investments subjected to the procedures did not appear to be unreasonable 
our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we stop accruing interest on investments and write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
fee income loan origination  facility  commitment  consent and other advance fees received by us on loan agreements or other investments are recorded as deferred income and recognized as income over the term of the loan 
payment in kind interest pik we currently hold  and we expect to hold in the future  some loans in our portfolio that contain a pik interest provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan  rather than being paid to us in cash  and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that pik interest is no longer collectible

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio 

table of contents our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio bore interest at fixed rates 
all of our sba leverage is currently at fixed rates 
because we currently borrow  and plan to borrow in the future  money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by floating rate assets in our investment portfolio
