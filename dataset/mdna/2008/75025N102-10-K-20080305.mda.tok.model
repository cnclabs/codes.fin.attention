actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

under multiple element arrangements  where each element is separately stated  sold and priced  the company allocates revenues to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
the company s vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately

under these subscription based contracts  revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period commencing generally when the product has been installed and training has been completed 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific client accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these allowances adequate and proper  if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents stock based compensation expense on january   radiant implemented the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the cost for employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
using the modified prospective transition method of adopting sfas r  radiant began recognizing compensation expense for equity based awards granted after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  plus unvested awards granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas under this method of implementation  no restatement of prior periods has been made 
at december   radiant had approximately million unvested options outstanding with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of 
the unvested options have a total unrecognized compensation expense of approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  which will be recognized over the weighted average period of years 
for the years ended december  and  radiant recognized stock compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  radiant applied the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to calculate the compensation expense for stock based awards 
historically  the company s general policy was to set the exercise price for its stock options equal to the market value on the grant date 
as a result  the options had no intrinsic value on their grant dates  and the company did not record any compensation expense unless the terms of the options were subsequently modified 
for the year ended december   the company would have recognized approximately million net of tax as expense for equity based awards under sfas r 
radiant uses the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  as well as future volatility and the risk free interest rate 
for options issued during the year ended december   radiant estimated the weighted average grant date fair value per share to be 
the key assumptions that we used to calculate these values are provided below year ended december  expected volatility expected life in years expected dividend yield risk free interest rate the assumptions made represent our management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if management had made different assumptions  the calculation of the options fair value and the resulting stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amounts recognized in radiant s financial statements 
in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of radiant s options  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all share based awards and only recognize expense for those awards the company expects to vest 
the stock based compensation expense recognized in radiant s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if management were to change the estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amount recognized in the radiant s financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  client inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
capitalized software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company s policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of license fees 
capitalization of such costs begins when a detail program or a working model has been produced as evidenced by the completion of design  planning  coding and testing  such that the product meets its design specifications and has thereby established technological feasibility 
capitalization of such costs ends when the resulting product is available for general release to the public 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which the company has determined is not more than five years 
management is required to use its judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
additionally  management is required to use its judgment in the valuation of the unamortized capitalized software costs in determining whether the recorded value is recoverable based on future product sales 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and finite lived identifiable intangibles not held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition  or an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is measured based on quoted market prices  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles as well as capitalized software costs 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  the company will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit which houses goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
the fair value of the reporting units is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if the company determines that there is an impairment in either an intangible asset  or goodwill  the company may be required to record an impairment charge in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined  which may have a negative impact on earnings 
income taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income  the timing of reversals of temporary taxable differences and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which became effective for radiant beginning in fin addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as a result of the implementation  the company recognized a million increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
this increase was accounted for as an adjustment to the beginning balance of the accumulated deficit on the accompanying balance sheet as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations  and fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas no 
revised requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
this standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and research and development 
fas no 
clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as a component of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net income should include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income 
the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
the effective date for both statements is for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fas no 
revised is prospective 
the effects on our financial position and consolidated results of operations could be significant but there will be no impact on our cash flows 
the adoption of fas no 
is prospective 
the impact to presentation and disclosure are applied retrospectively 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of fas no 
revised and fas no 
will have on our financial position  consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb released fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
under fas no 
companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
this election  called the fair value option  will enable some companies to reduce volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of fas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements 
fas no
