item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genetics and molecular diagnostic company providing genetic analysis products and services and developing diagnostic tests initially targeted at non invasive prenatal genetic disorders 
our genetic analysis business provides applications that translate genomic science into solutions for biomedical research  agricultural  molecular medicine applications 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance nucleic acid analysis platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations 
our genetic services business provides genetic analysis services to customers as a complement and as an alternative to our systems product offerings and acts as a resource for developing and expanding our genetic analysis products 
our research and development efforts are committed to producing new and improved components and applications for our massarray system that will deliver greater system versatility and also reduce the cost per data point generated 
we are developing various molecular diagnostic tests in prenatal genetic disorders  oncology and infectious diseases 
we have in licensed exclusive rights to use free fetal nucleic acids for diagnostic testing from maternal serum or plasma to ascertain various genetic disorders  including gender determination through agreements with isis innovation limited and the chinese university of hong kong which together provide exclusive license rights covering the general diagnostic use of fetal nucleic acids derived from maternal plasma or serum in countries  including the united states  canada  and with some limitation in other countries in europe  australia  canada and japan as well as non exclusive rights in hong kong 
our exclusively licensed patent portfolio now includes the general use  on any technology platform  of fetal nucleic acids derived from maternal plasma  serum and in some cases blood for non invasive prenatal genetic diagnostic testing  including genetic  expression and epigenetic based assays and tests 
diagnostic tests based on our foundational intellectual property  which is disease independent  could be developed  provided certain technical challenges are overcome  for cystic fibrosis  tay sachs  hemoglobinopathies sickle cell anemia and the thalassemias  rhesus d  gender determination for x linked disorders  and chromosomal aneuploidies such as down syndrome  and others  on any platform including mass spectrometry and real time polymerase chain reaction amplification platforms 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our massarray hardware  software and consumable products 
our standard massarray system combines the following basic components  which contributes to the high level of performance in terms of speed  accuracy and cost efficiency a mass spectrometer  which uses an established analytical method that we have adapted for dna analysis  proprietary analytical reaction technology and sample preparation and dispensing hardware to prepare dna for analysis including a coated silicon chip known as the spectrochip bioarray  and bioinformatics software that records  calculates  and reports the data generated by the mass spectrometer 
our massarray technology is accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system for the fine mapping genotyping market 
our customers include clinical research laboratories  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and government agencies 
to maximize market penetration and provide customer support for our expanding user base  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe  india  japan  and other areas of asia  in addition to regional distribution partners in france  israel  south korea  new zealand  singapore  taiwan  and turkey 
genetic analysis is primarily conducted in two key biomedical research market sectors the research market  where we have many customers  and the clinical analysis market  where we are expanding 
the research market 
table of contents is mainly comprised of academic and government institutions  which make initial genetic discoveries 
however  it is the source of discoveries of new genetic content 
the clinical analysis market is significantly larger and takes the genetic analysis a step further to establish the use of genes and genetic markers for the potential benefit of the general population 
the needs of these markets differ significantly 
the academic research market  which requires the highest data density per sample  is more tolerant to inconsistencies in data and error rates  and typically has a shorter window of opportunity 
sample throughput is very high 
the academic research market is extremely price competitive 
the clinical analysis market is typically interested in a defined number of markers per sample  is not as tolerant to inconsistencies and error rates  typically has a longer development cycle  and is less price competitive 
sample throughput requirements are not nearly as high 
considering the clinical analysis market s requirements and the strengths of the massarray system  including its high sensitivity  specificity  and reproducibility  we believe there is significant opportunity to be more competitive in the clinical analysis market 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis in the molecular medicine market 
epigenetic analysis  also known as dna methylation analysis  is the study of changes in dna in the form of chromatin modifications and or changes in the presence or absence of methyl groups in specific areas of the dna 
epigenetic analysis is an important part of cancer and other research areas 
we are targeting customers across four segments clinical research and clinical marker validation  the emerging field of molecular medicine  diagnostic service laboratories  and animal testing laboratories 
we believe the market and opportunities for growth for fine mapping genotyping are increasing as more researchers are completing their larger genomic studies such as whole genome scans 
epigenetic analysis is a relatively new and emerging market  that  along with gene expression analyses  are increasingly being utilized by researchers in conjunction with genotyping to attempt to fully understand genetic cause and effect 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  and from services contracts through our genetic analysis contract research services business 
the impact of our product offerings and contract research services business on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we expect revenues from molecular diagnostics through out licensing and commercialization of our non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology  including technology for rhesus d incompatibility using a real time polymerase chain reaction platform  to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that revenues are realized from our molecular diagnostic tests  including non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology or from our prior disease gene discoveries  if at all  they may fluctuate significantly as revenues will be based upon the occurrence of certain milestones  our reliance upon and the progress made by our collaborative partners  successful product development and commercialization  and product demand  all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any licensing and milestone payments and royalty or revenue sharing payments on future diagnostic or other product sales are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to achieve such revenues we will likely be dependent upon the efforts  resources and success of present and future collaborators and licensees who may need to invest significant dollar amounts in research and development efforts  commercialization efforts  clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals over several years 
such revenues  if any  are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and short term investments totaling million and working capital of million 

table of contents in april  we closed a million registered direct offering of our common stock to several new and existing investors 
under the terms of the transaction  we issued and sold  shares at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses 
in october  we closed a private placement of our common stock for approximately million to certain investors 
under the terms of the transaction we issued and sold  shares at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and estimated transaction expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from genetic services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination and sfas no 
 business combinations 
amounts accrued relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  and approximately million and million remained accrued  respectively 
the amount accrued at december  represents our remaining lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million from existing subleased space 
if we do not receive all the amounts due to us under non cancelable subleases  we will incur additional expense 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in  or intangible assets totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balance based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review the historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged against cost of goods sold and the total reserve was million at december  income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we have maintained a valuation allowance against us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold required under sfas no 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 

table of contents effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently in the process of determining the impact of the provisions of sfas no 
on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf no 

eitf no 
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to executory contractual arrangements be deferred and recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
we will adopt eitf no 
as of january   and it is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
sfas no 
r  business combinations  was issued in december of sfas no 
r established principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the guidance will become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
massarray and other product related revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 
consumable sales increased to million in from million in the increase in compared to was a result of an increase in our installed base of massarray compact systems as well as demand for our iplex genotyping assay 
massarray and other product related revenue increased to million in from million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in massarray system hardware and software sales to million in from million in revenue from other product sales  including massarray system maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties  for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we recorded genetic analysis service revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in service revenues for the year ended december  the increase from is attributable to growth in our contract research service business primarily in the clinical analysis and academic research markets 
research and other revenue was million in and million during the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue related to the license of certain proprietary genetic content to a third party 
the timing of research revenues depends upon our expenditures on grant research and the receipt of the grant funding from the sponsoring agencies 
we expect grant revenue to be minimal going forward 
domestic and non us revenues were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray system  revenue recognition criteria  and the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services 
cost of product and service revenues and gross margins cost of product revenues was million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for product revenues in compared to is attributable to higher systems sales with a favorable mix of new systems at higher margins versus trade ins and strategic system placements at lower margins  as well as increased consumable sales that generally have higher average gross margins compared to systems sales 
cost of service revenues was million and million and gross margins were and  respectively  for the years ended december  and our genetic analysis contract research service business incurred higher expenses  primarily in salaries and related personnel expenses  as operations continue to become fully functional in anticipation of service contract requirements 
gross margins on contract research service revenues are dependent on the particular contract terms of the work undertaken 
the company s overall gross margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in overall gross margin in is attributable to lower margins within contract 
table of contents research services as we increase operations to become fully functional  offset by an overall increase in consumables sales that sell at higher average gross margins 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the selling price for systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of products and contract research services sold  the mix of systems and consumables sold  competitive conditions  costs of goods  sales volumes  discounts offered  sales through distributors  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies

these increases were offset by a reduction in start up costs in compared to of million related to our china office 
we expect our sales and marketing headcount and associated expenses to increase in compared to  as we strengthen our sales force and continue building our commercial development team for our non invasive prenatal diagnostic technology 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for legal  finance  and human resource personnel  and their related department expenses 

table of contents the increase in general and administrative expenses of million for compared to primarily resulted from increased headcount and travel expense of million  share based compensation of million  legal expense of million related to our patent portfolio  consultant expenses of million  insurance costs and other office expenses of million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced headcount based overhead allocation of million  lower administrative expenses of million and higher absorption of overhead costs of million 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in compared to  as we build our infrastructure in order to support our anticipated growth 
asset impairment and restructuring charges during  we introduced a cost reduction plan that included a reduction of existing headcount by approximately across all departments by the end of we incurred a charge of million in relating to severance and related expenses in connection with this headcount reduction 
at december   we had an accrued balance of million in respect of the restructuring charges representing the remaining payout of severance costs with the remaining charges incurred during during  the company incurred no charges related to this restructuring and does not anticipate to incur any further expenses related to this cost reduction plan 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  plc in  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights that were being amortized over three to five years 
no amortization was recorded in and million was recorded as amortization in as of december   these intangible assets were fully amortized 
interest income interest income was million in compared to million in the increase in compared to was due to higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of our registered direct offering of our common stock with net aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses in april and the private placement of our common stock with net aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses in october realized loss on marketable securities realized loss on marketable securities was million compared to no realized loss in the realized loss was due to an other than temporary impairment on one of our investments in auction rate securities 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if uncertainties in these markets continue and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary in our remaining auction rate security investments  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through additional impairment charges 
interest expense interest expense was  and  for and  respectively 
our interest expense balance remains lower due to the payoff of credit facilities and capital leases after our private placement funding in june  offset by the utilization of our asset backed loan commencing in september 
table of contents deferred income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities rated bbb or above by standard poors 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we invest primarily in auction rate securities  commercial paper of prime quality  certificates of deposit  guaranteed bankers acceptance and us government instruments  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at december   approximately million of principal was invested in auction rate securities ars 
the ars held are private placement securities with various long term nominal maturities with interest rates reset through a dutch auction each month  except for one ars that resets every days 
the monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
the investments in ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by insurance securitizations and other structured credits  including corporate bonds and to a lesser degree  pools of residential and commercial mortgages 

table of contents consistent with our investment policy guidelines  all ars investments purchased by us had aaa aa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held at december  have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
all of these securities retained at least a rating of aaa aa as of december  we account for our marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and classified them as available for sale 
the carrying value of all ars was reduced by million  from million to million at december   reflecting the change in fair market value 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  a realized loss of approximately million was recognized in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the portion of ars holdings that the company has concluded have an other than temporary decline in value 
in addition  we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income as a reduction in shareholders equity  reflecting adjustments to ars holdings that we assessed have a temporary decline in value 
the million impairment charge does not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial flexibility 
due to the lack of availability of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of marketable securities and ars  we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
in the event we need to access the ars investments that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the market value of these securities may decline 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for the need to reclassify the remaining ars investments to long term 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound  or gbp  and the euro  or eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
functional currency of operations as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities us dollars gbp in millions euro 
table of contents a movement of in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
