item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the sunbelt  mid atlantic and the lower midwest 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
as of february  we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are usually anchored by a wal mart store and in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality branded merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal we historically have comparable store sales in the low to mid single digit range 
we plan to increase total company wide square footage by approximately in fiscal  which is slightly below our increases over the last several years of between and 
we believe total sales percentage growth will be mid to high single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our product margin due to improved vendor discounts  fewer retail reductions  increased efficiencies in logistics and favorable leveraging of store occupancy costs 
we expect a slight improvement in product margin rate in fiscal attributable primarily to improved vendor discounts 
due to our increased sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to increase somewhat in fiscal primarily due to lower than normal historical sales growth and increases in statutory minimum wage 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base and to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects 
hibbett maintains a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide gaap net sales by product category 
our audited consolidated financial statements presented in this form k differ from our earnings release reported on march  due to a refinement of our estimate of the lower of cost or market reserve 
the revised estimate resulted in a decrease of million in ending inventory and pre tax income from previously reported numbers 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year ended february  includes weeks of operations 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year ended february  includes weeks of operations and the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year ended january  includes weeks of operations 
we have operated as a public company and have been incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware since october  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations expressed for the periods indicated

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended february   from million for the weeks ended february  we attribute this slight increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports and sports additions stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended february  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a decrease in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended february  compared to the weeks ended january  primarily as the result of a decrease in store traffic resulting from a difficult economic environment in our industry 
net sales increased for the weeks ended february  compared to the weeks ended january  net sales from the rd week of fiscal accounted for approximately million or approximately 
we believe the decrease in comparable store sales is attributable to overall economic pressures on our consumers resulting from the housing slump  rising fuel prices and anxiety over the economy in general 
additionally  our results were impacted by a weakening in our urban markets as we believe those fashion dollars historically used for high priced athletic shoes and fashion items shifted to high priced electronics 
we experienced the following trends in fiscal we experienced an overall decline in footwear and equipment sales 
pro licensed apparel continued its slow down  especially in nba licensed product 
we saw a negative shift in our urban fashion apparel and footwear 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
during the weeks ended february   stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this decrease in gross profit to a slight decrease in product margins and the deleveraging of store occupancy costs and distribution expenses 
store occupancy experienced its largest increases in rent expense and utilities expenses as a percent to sales 
distribution expenses were impacted primarily in data processing costs resulting from contract labor costs to support information technology upgrades and projects 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february  expenses contributing to this increase included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points while decreasing basis points at the administrative level 
store costs were impacted by the lower than expected sales growth and larger than normal fourth quarter store openings  while administrative salaries decreased as a result of lost bonuses 
net advertising expenses increased basis points due to the increased advertising efforts for new and low performing stores 
stock based compensation accounted for basis points 
the expense associated with the movement of certain grant dates into the first quarter as compared to a year ago was somewhat offset by a higher than normal forfeiture of awards resulting from employee turnover and loss of performance based awards 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   and in the weeks ended february  the weighted average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased in lease terms at years compared to years  respectively 
we attribute the increase in depreciation expense as a percent to sales to the shorter lease terms as well as the information systems placed in service as of february  provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   compared to for the weeks ended february  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in rate over last year is primarily the result of the favorable resolution of certain state tax issues  lower than historical stock option exercise behavior  and higher than historical equity forfeitures offset somewhat by the permanent differences related to incentive stock options 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended february   from million for the weeks ended january  we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports and closed hibbett sports stores and sports additions stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended february  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  primarily as the result of an increase in price 
higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
we believe sales pick up related to the rd week contributed approximately to the increase in sales over last year 
we believe the increase in comparable store sales is attributable to an overall positive merchandise performance during the year and increased focus on customer service 
additionally  our results were positively impacted in the third quarter by the introduction of tax free holidays in three of our states and an increased promotional effort in an attempt to leverage the strong post hurricane sales from the prior year 
we also experienced strong seasonal sales in the last quarter of fiscal related to the christmas holidays 
nike and under armour brands experienced solid performance in youth and cleats  performance apparel and team equipment 
pro and college licensed apparel performed well  particularly in youth products and nfl jerseys 
key professional teams in our market included the indianapolis colts  new orleans saints and chicago bears 
top selling nfl jerseys included peyton manning  reggie bush  tony romo and brian urlacher 
college licensed apparel was led by women s nike product 
we continue to experience weakness in caps and in classics footwear 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
during the weeks ended january   stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this increase in gross profit primarily to a reduction in markdown rate 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to decreases in common area maintenance and rental expenses as a percentage of sales 
offsetting these decreases were distribution center costs by basis points  primarily due to the increased repair and maintenance expenses and a decrease in vendor violations 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january  these expenses increased as a percentage of net sales between periods primarily due to the implementation of r which added basis points in stock based compensation 
other trends experienced included an increase in legal fees as a percent of net sales of basis points related to pending litigation  an increase in credit debit card fees as a percent of net sales of basis points related to the increased use of these tenders by our customers over cash  and decreases as a percent of net sales in insurance costs of basis points and freight and shipping costs of basis points 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   and in the weeks ended january  we experienced a slight trend upwards in the terms of our new store leases which contributed to the leveraging of depreciation expense as leasehold improvements were expensed over the longer lease term which  in most cases  is less than the estimated useful life of the asset 
our average lease term of leases added in fiscal was years compared to years for leases added in fiscal provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   compared to for the weeks ended january  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in rate over last year is primarily the result of the permanent difference related to incentive stock options arising as a result of applying the provisions of sfas no 
r 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  february  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as pre christmas and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the weeks ended february  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the weeks ended february  and the weeks ended january   respectively 
inventory levels have continued to increase year over year as the number of stores have increased 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal   and  respectively  while the accounts payable increase provided cash of million during fiscal as we managed cash while protecting vendor discounts 
during fiscal and fiscal  the accounts payable decrease used cash of million and million  respectively 
net income provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
also offsetting uses of cash were non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a shift in the timing of certain equity awards contributed to the increase in stock based compensation in fiscal over fiscal investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended february   february  and january  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net purchases of short term investments were million during fiscal compared to net redemptions of short term investments of million during fiscal and net purchases of short term investments of million during fiscal gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  short term investments were redeemed for cash used in our stock repurchase program 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel or relocate existing stores 
furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to office expansion and security equipment for our stores 
as of february   we had an approximate million outlay remaining on enhancements to our jda system relating to inventory planning and replenishment 
we anticipate that these upgrades will be implemented in the first half of fiscal and believe these enhancements will help us develop better efficiencies in the allocation and planning of inventory and better enable us to analyze and generally improve sales across all markets and merchandise by allowing us to better analyze inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the weeks ended february  compared to million in the weeks ended february  and million in the weeks ended january   respectively 
the cash fluctuation as compared to prior fiscal years was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock 
we expended million  million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
financing activities also consisted of proceeds from transactions in our common stock and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allows borrowings up to million and which renews in august under the provisions of this facility  we can draw down funds when our main operating account falls below  the facility does not require a commitment or agency fee and there are no covenant restrictions associated with the facility 
we plan to renew this facility as it expires and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
subsequent to fiscal year ended february   we entered into an additional revolving credit facility that allows borrowings up to million to facilitate our stock repurchase program 
the facility is unsecured and expires on december  there are no covenant restrictions on this facility 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allowed borrowings up to million and renewed annually in november 
under the provisions of this facility  we could draw down funds when our main operating account fell below  the facility did not require a commitment or agency fee and there were no covenant restrictions associated with the facility 
at january   we had two unsecured credit facilities that allowed borrowings up to million and million and which renewed annually in november 
under the provisions of these facilities  we could draw down funds when our main operating account fell below  neither facility required a commitment or agency fee nor were there any covenant requirements 
as of february   february  and january   we had no debt outstanding under any of these facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans and plans for the repurchase of our common stock  we believe we can fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  through periodic future borrowings against our credit facilities 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sports  inc at february  payments due under contractual obligations in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter see debt consolidated financial statement note in item as of fiscal  we do not have any capital lease obligations 
see lease commitments consolidated financial statements note in item approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin no 
and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not provided any financial guarantees as of february  all purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the table above 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 
inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control 
national or international events  including the war on terrorism and unrest in the middle east  could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where a significant portion of our merchandise is manufactured 
these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations 
consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures 
merchandise costs 
based on current economic conditions  we expect that any increase in merchandise costs per unit will be offset by improved vendor discounts and increased retail prices in fiscal freight costs 
we continued to experience rising fuel costs during fiscal that increased our freight costs and we expect that fuel costs may continue to rise in fiscal we do not expect increases in freight costs to have a material effect on our results of operations as we continue to leverage the costs associated with inbound freight against the cost of outbound freight 
minimum wage 
recent increases in the mandated minimum wage have impacted our payroll costs 
congress has approved federal minimum wage increases by approximately over a three year period with the first increase of approximately taking place during fiscal by july  the federal minimum wage will increase an additional 
all of the states we operate in have either passed legislation to raise the minimum wage or their minimum wage is increasing in conjunction with the federal minimum wage 
some of the states have automatic provision for future increase based on the consumer price index or on inflation 
insurance costs 
in fiscal  we continued to experience a decrease in general business insurance that began in fiscal  when we changed to a partially self insured program for our workers compensation and general liability 
during both fiscal periods  we have experienced an increase in our average monthly health insurance claims 
in fiscal  we experienced an increase in general business insurance costs due to raised limits on directors and officers insurance and expanded coverage on our distribution center 
during the same period  health insurance declined due to a reduction in claims 
in fiscal  we expect that general business insurance costs will stabilize while health insurance costs will increase slightly 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement this statement permits companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value 
at each reporting date subsequent to adoption  unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected must be reported in earnings 
sfas no 
was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that began after november   or february  for our company 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  however  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we implemented sfas no 
on february  and the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies reflected in the consolidated financial statements are detailed below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including gift card and layaway sales  in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
retail merchandise sales occur on site in our retail stores 
customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on layaway 
the customer may make further payments in installments  but the entire purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by us within days 
the down payment and any installments are recorded by us as short term deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the merchandise 
we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
retail sales are recorded net of returns and discounts and exclude sales taxes 
the cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized by us 
proceeds received from the issuance of gift cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue is subsequently recognized at the time the customer redeems the gift cards and takes possession of the merchandise 
unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a current liability 
it is not our policy to take unclaimed layaway deposits and unredeemed gift cards into income 
as of february   february  and january   there was no breakage revenue recorded in income 
the deferred revenue liability for layaway deposits and unredeemed gift cards was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
any unrecognized breakage revenue is immaterial 
we escheat unredeemed gift cards 
inventory valuation 
lower of cost or market beginning in fiscal  inventory is valued using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market is determined based on estimated net realizable value 
we regularly review inventories to determine if the carrying value exceeds realizable value  and we record a reserve to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value as necessary 
we account for obsolescence as part of our lower of cost or market reserve based on historical trends and specific identification 
as of february   the reserve was million 
there was no amount reserved as of february  our inventory valuation reserves contain uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding such factors as market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
prior to fiscal  cost was assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method 
in using this method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins were computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
our management believes that the application of the cost method is preferable as compared to the retail method because it increases the organizational focus on the actual margin realized on each sale 
shrink reserves we accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger 
store counts are typically performed on a cyclical basis and the distribution center s counts are performed mid year and in late december or early january every year 
as of february  and february   the reserve was million and million  respectively 
accrued expenses 
on a monthly basis  we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates relate to payroll and payroll tax expenses  property taxes  insurance related expenses and utility expenses 
estimates are primarily based on current activity and historical results and are adjusted as our estimates change 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the accrual calculated 
historically  the differences in these accruals have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
we estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the year progresses  we refine the estimates of the year s taxable income as new information becomes available  including year to date financial results 
this continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position and changes in estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
uncertain tax positions we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin no 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
litigation accruals 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated accruals would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of a particular litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
impairment of assets 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of long lived assets and intangibles may be impaired and not recoverable 
our policy is to recognize any impairment loss on long lived assets as a charge to current income when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is assessed considering the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
if estimated cash flows are insufficient to recover the investment  an impairment loss is recognized based on a comparison of the cost of the asset to fair value less any costs of disposition 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value at the date of grant of stock options granted under our stock option plans and stock purchase rights associated with the employee stock purchase plan 
volatility is estimated as of the date of grant or purchase date based on management s estimate of the time period that captures the relative volatility of our stock 
we use the risk free interest rate on the date of grant or purchase date based on the us treasury rate with maturities approximating the expected lives of our options 
the effects on net income and earnings per shares eps of stock based compensation expense  net of tax  calculated using the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights in accordance with the black scholes options pricing model are not necessarily representative of the effects of our results of operations in the future 
in addition  the compensation expense utilizes an option pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives 
our stock option grants have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable 
therefore  the actual fair value of a stock option grant may be different from our estimates 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
all estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and updated when applicable 
insurance accruals 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including employee related health benefits  a portion of which is paid by our employees  workers compensation and general liability 
the estimates and accruals for these liabilities associated with these risks are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information  including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs 
operating leases 
we lease our retail stores and distribution center under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
we use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and for our stock repurchase program  and therefore do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
any future decision to declare or pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer see item a 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our net sales and operating income are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales increases during the holiday selling season 
however  the seasonal fluctuations are mitigated by the strong product demand in the spring and back to school sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores  the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  merchandise mix  the relative proportion of stores represented by each of our three store concepts and demand for apparel and accessories driven by local interest in sporting events 
although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that  historically  inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations as we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers 
however  in recent periods  we have experienced an impact on overall sales due to a consumer spending slowdown spawned by higher gas prices and a slump in the housing market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to market risk from interest rate fluctuations on our credit facilities  which bear interest at rates that vary with libor  prime or quoted cost of funds rates 
during the majority of fiscal  we had only one facility that allowed borrowings up to million 
in august  we renewed this facility and increased the allowed borrowings to million 
during the majority of fiscal and all of fiscal  we had two operating facilities allowing combined borrowings up to million 
effective november  we elected to renew only one facility that allowed borrowings up to million and renewed annually 
in february  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we added another facility which allows borrowings up to million which we intend to use for our stock repurchase program 
the new facility expires in december and is renewable at that time 
interest rates on this facility vary with the british bankers association bba libor rate 
at the end of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we had no borrowings outstanding under any credit facility 
there were days during the fifty two weeks ended february   where we incurred borrowings against our credit facility for an average borrowing of million 
during fiscal  the maximum amount outstanding against these agreements was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
there were twenty four days during the fifty three weeks ended february   where we incurred borrowings against our credit facilities for an average and maximum borrowing of million and million and an average interest rate of 
at no time during the fifty two weeks ended january   did we incur borrowings against our credit facility 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
