competitive strengths we believe that we are a leader in the markets we serve as a result of the following competitive strengths leading market share and recognized brand names 
the tempress  bruce technologies and pr hoffman brands have long been recognized in our industry and identified with high quality products  innovative solutions and dependable service 
we believe that our brand recognition and experience will continue to allow us to capitalize on current and future market opportunities in the solar industry 
we have been providing horizontal diffusion furnaces and polishing supplies and equipment to our customers for over years 
we have sold and installed over horizontal furnaces worldwide and benefit from what we believe to be the largest installed customer base in the semiconductor industry  which we believe offers an opportunity for replacement and expansion demand 
customers that have purchased our furnaces can leverage their investment in training  spare parts inventory and other costs by acquiring additional equipment from us 
we also have an extensive retrofit  parts and service business  which typically generates higher margins than our equipment business 
experienced management team 
we are led by a highly experienced management team 
our chief executive officer ceo has over years of industry experience  including years with our company 
our four general managers have an average of over years of solar and semiconductor industry experience and an average of years with our company including our predecessor companies 
established  diversified customer base 
we have long standing relationships with many of our top customers  which we believe remain strong 
we maintain a broad base of customers  including leading solar cell manufacturing companies  as well as semiconductor and wafer manufacturing companies 
during fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue and our top customers collectively represented approximately of our net revenue 
in fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue  and our top customers collectively represented approximately of our net revenue 
in fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue  and our top customers collectively represented approximately of our net revenue 
our largest customer has been different in each of the last three fiscal years 
proven acquisition track record 
over the last thirteen years we have developed an acquisition program that has resulted in the acquisition of four significant businesses 
in october  we acquired rd  a solar and semiconductor automation company located near montpellier  france 
we believe the acquisition of the technology and business of rd enhances our growth strategy by allowing us to increase our sales by offering an integrated system under the tempress brand to the solar industry 
in july  we acquired the bruce technologies line of semiconductor horizontal furnace operations  product lines and other assets from kokusai  a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  japan and its affiliate  kokusai electric europe  gmbh 
we continue to market the horizontal furnace product line under the name bruce technologies 
bruce technologies has a large installed base  including several large semiconductor manufacturers 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of pr hoffman 
this acquisition enabled us to offer new consumable products  including lapping and polishing carriers  polishing templates  lapping and polishing machines and related consumable and spare parts to our existing customer base as well as to target new customers 
in  we acquired certain assets of tempress and hired tempress s engineers to develop our first models of the tempress horizontal diffusion furnaces for production in the netherlands 
technical expertise 
we have highly trained and experienced mechanical  chemical  environmental  electronic  hardware and software engineers and support personnel 
our engineering group possesses core competencies in product applications and support systems  automation  sophisticated controls  chemical vapor deposition  diffusion and pyrogenic processes  robotics  vacuum systems  ultra clean applications and software driven control packages 
we believe this expertise enables us to design  develop and deliver high quality  technically advanced integrated product solutions for solar cell and semiconductor manufacturing customers 
leading technology solutions and new product development 
we pursue a partnering based approach  in which our engineering and development teams work closely with our customers to ensure our products are tailored to meet our customers specific requirements 
we believe this approach enables us to more closely align ourselves with our customers and provide them with superior systems 
we believe our line of horizontal diffusion furnaces  which allow high wafer per hour throughput  is more technologically advanced and reliable than most of our competitors equipment 
in addition  the processing and temperature control systems within the furnace provide diverse and proven process capabilities  which enable the application of high quality films onto silicon wafers 
we believe our recently acquired rd solar automation technology will provide efficiencies in the manufacturing process that will allow our customers to be more competitive in their respective markets 
we developed a small batch vertical furnace jointly with a major european customer and are currently developing five different thin film processes for use with this furnace 
we retain full ownership of this technology 
we shipped two of these systems in fiscal and one in in addition  in  we shipped a small batch vertical furnace utilizing dsg technologies dsg microwave technology to dsg 
in  we also began selling precision thickness wafer carriers 
this is an internally developed product that we expect will increase our sales to the wafer carrier market 
geographically diverse customer base 
we believe that our geographically diverse revenue stream helps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in any one market  and to maximize our access to potential customers relative to our competitors with geographically concentrated operations 
the geographic distribution of our net revenues from fiscal through is as follows asia pacific north america europe the figures set forth in the above table represent percentages of the net revenues for each of the last three fiscal years as such net revenues are reported in our financial statements at
