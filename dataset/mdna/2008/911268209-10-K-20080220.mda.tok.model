overview we are a leading provider of consumer internet and media services through a number of brands including classmates  mypoints  netzero  and juno 
our classmates media segment services are online social networking and online loyalty marketing 
our primary communications segment services are internet access and email 
on a combined basis  our web properties attract a significant number of internet users each month  and we offer marketers a broad array of internet advertising services as well as online market research and measurement services 
segment definitions we report our businesses in two reportable operating segments segment internet services classmates media social networking and loyalty marketing communications internet access  email  internet security  and web hosting we have modified our segment reporting structure during to establish classmates media as a separate operating segment in the place of the former content media segment that no longer will be reported 
the new classmates media segment includes our online social networking and online loyalty marketing operations  which had formerly been part of the content media segment 
web hosting and photo sharing  which also had formerly been part of the content media segment  have been moved to the communications segment 
in addition  we have eliminated our historical practice of separately reporting certain unallocated corporate expenses 
under the new reporting structure  corporate expenses are allocated to the operating segments 
the new segment reporting structure is aligned with how management reviews and measures segment performance for internal reporting purposes 
all prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation 
we made the decision during to exit our photo sharing business and we have entered into a commercial arrangement with a third party in connection therewith 
key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor our performance and trends affecting our businesses  and to develop forecasts and budgets 
these measures include pay accounts 
our pay accounts generate a significant portion of our revenues and represent one of the most important drivers of our business model 
a pay account is defined as a member who has subscribed to  and paid for  our billable services  and whose subscription has not expired 
in general  the key metrics that drive revenues from our pay accounts base include the number of pay accounts and the average monthly revenue per pay account 
in general  a pay account becomes a free account following the expiration or termination of the related subscription 
arpu 
we monitor the average monthly revenue per pay account  or arpu 
arpu is calculated by dividing billable services revenues for a period by the average number of pay accounts for that period  divided by the number of months in that period 
the average number of pay accounts is the simple average of the number of pay accounts at the beginning and end of a period 
arpu may fluctuate from period to period as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to changes in the mix of pay services and the related pricing plans  the use of promotional or retention pricing to attract new  or retain existing  paying subscribers  increases or decreases in the price of our services  and the timing of pay accounts being added or removed during a period 
churn 
to evaluate the retention characteristics of our membership base  we also monitor the percentage of pay accounts that terminate or expire  which we refer to as our average monthly churn rate 
our average monthly churn rate is calculated as the total number of pay accounts that terminated or expired in a period divided by the average number of pay accounts for the same period  divided by the number of months in that period 
our average monthly churn percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to our mix of subscription terms  which affects the timing of subscription expirations  and other factors 
we make certain normalizing adjustments to the calculation of our churn percentage for periods in which we add a significant number of pay accounts due to acquisitions 
except with respect to our social networking pay accounts  we do not include in our churn calculation those accounts cancelled during the first days of service unless the accounts have upgraded from free accounts  although a number of such accounts will be included in our account totals at any given measurement date 
subscribers who cancel one pay service but subscribe to another pay service are not necessarily considered to have cancelled a pay account depending on the services and  as such  our overall churn rate is not necessarily indicative of the percentage of subscribers cancelling any particular service 
active accounts 
we monitor the number of active accounts among our membership base 
active classmates media segment accounts are defined as all segment pay accounts as of the date presented  the monthly average for the reporting period of all free social networking accounts who have visited the company s domestic or international social networking web sites excluding the names database at least once during the reporting period  and the monthly average for the reporting period of all loyalty marketing members who have earned or redeemed points during such period 
active communications segment accounts include all segment pay accounts as of the date presented and the number of free internet access and email accounts that logged on to the company s services at least once during the preceding days 
in general  we count and track pay accounts and free accounts by unique member identifiers 
users have the ability to register for separate services under separate brands and member identifiers independently 
we do not track whether a pay account has purchased more than one of our services unless the account uses the same member identifier 
as a result  total active accounts may not represent total unique users 
at any point in time  our pay account base includes a number of accounts receiving a free period of service as either a promotion or retention tool and a number of accounts that have notified us that they are terminating their service but whose service remains in effect 
the following table sets forth  for the dates or three month periods presented  as applicable  our pay accounts at the end of the period  segment revenues  arpu monthly average for the period  churn monthly average for the period and active accounts at the end of the period 
december  september  june  march  december  consolidated total pay accounts a in thousands    churn a classmates media segment revenues in thousands    of total revenues pay accounts in thousands     of total pay accounts segment churn arpu segment active accounts b in millions c communications segment revenues in thousands    of total revenues pay accounts a in thousands access      other total communications pay accounts    of total pay accounts segment churn a arpu segment active accounts in millions a growth in pay accounts during the quarter ended september  includes a loss of  pay accounts resulting from the company s decision to exit our photo sharing business 
growth in pay accounts during the quarter ended december  includes a loss of  pay accounts resulting from the company s decision to exit our voip business 
excluding the loss of photo sharing and voip customers related to the company s decisions to exit these businesses  communications segment churn would have been in the quarter ended september  and in the quarter ended december   and consolidated churn would have been in the quarter ended september  and in the quarter ended december  b the numbers of active international accounts prior to the quarter ended june  were derived by dividing the actual total number of visits to the web sites during the period by an estimate of the number of times a user returned to the web sites during the period 
c we believe the actual number of classmates media segment active accounts for the quarter ended december  was approximately million  although a technical reporting issue interfered with our ability to collect certain visit data for a brief period 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  including those for interim financial information and with the instructions for form k and article of regulation s x issued by the sec 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
the results of operations for interim or transition periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for a full year 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are comprised of billable services revenues  which are derived primarily from fees charged to pay accounts  and advertising revenues 
we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  no significant company obligations remain  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also apply the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
billable services revenues are recognized in the period in which fees are fixed or determinable and the related services are provided to the customer 
our pay accounts generally pay in advance for their service by credit card  and revenue is then recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from pay accounts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue 
we offer alternative payment methods to credit cards for certain pay service plans 
these alternative payment methods currently include ach  payment by personal check or money order or through a local telephone company 
in circumstances where payment is not received in advance  revenue is only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured 
advertising revenues consist primarily of amounts from internet search partners that are generated as a result of users utilizing partner internet search services  amounts generated from the display of third party registration offers at the end of classmates pay account registration process  amounts generated from other display advertisements  and amounts generated from referring members to third party web sites or services 
we recognize advertising revenues in the period in which the advertisement is displayed or  for performance based arrangements  when the related performance criteria are met 
in determining whether an arrangement exists  we ensure that a binding contract is in place  such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer specific agreement 
we assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether the fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and the payment terms associated with the transaction 
the reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of internally tracked performance data to the contractual performance obligation and  when available  to third party or customer provided performance data 
advertising revenues for our loyalty marketing service consist primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members  when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions 
each of these activities is a discrete  independent activity  which generally is specified in the sales agreement for each advertising customer 
as the earning activities take place  activity measurement data examples include the number of emails delivered and the number of responses received is accumulated and the related revenue is recorded 
probability of collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
deferred revenue also represents invoiced services that have not yet been performed 
business combinations all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the costs  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets acquired  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
consequently  to the extent an indefinite lived  definite lived or a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period 
definite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis 
we determine the appropriate amortization method by performing an analysis of expected cash flows over the estimated useful lives of the assets and match the amortization expense to the expected cash flows from those assets 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
two areas  in particular  that require significant judgment are estimating the fair value and related useful lives of identifiable intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we may obtain appraisals from valuation specialists for certain intangible assets 
while there are a number of different methods used in estimating the fair value of acquired intangible assets  there are two approaches primarily used the discounted cash flow and market comparison approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  terminal growth rate  subscriber churn  terminal value  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to market comparables 
most of the above assumptions are made based on available historical and market information 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which among other things  addresses financial accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be carried at cost  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
we perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that goodwill might be permanently impaired 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key management or other personnel  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the acquired business or our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
the testing for a potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units with their respective net book values  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds net book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than net book value  including goodwill  then the carrying amount of the goodwill is compared with its implied fair value 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
although we operate in two reportable segments in accordance with sfas no 
 we have identified four reporting units classmates  the names database  mypoints  and our web hosting services for purposes of evaluating goodwill 
each of these reporting units constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available 
we performed step one of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our classmates  the names database  mypoints  and web hosting services reporting units exceeded their net book values 
our analysis included sufficient tolerance for sensitivity in key assumptions 
accordingly  step two was not required 
estimated fair values continue to exceed carrying values because these businesses continue to meet or exceed our expectations and  in certain circumstances  market comparables continue to increase in values 
the determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units included a study of market comparables  including the selection of appropriate valuation multiples  the compilation of recent applicable market sales transaction data and associated multiples  and discounted cash flow models based on our internal forecasts and projections 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of the income approach and two methods under the market approach the guideline company method and the guideline transaction method 
under the income approach  we estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method is dependent on a number of factors  including projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows  assumed discount rates and other assumptions 
we considered factors such as historical performance  anticipated market conditions  operating expense trends  and capital expenditures  among others 
the significant assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units under the income approach were discount rate of to  terminal growth rate of to and resulting capitalization rate of to 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate and resulting capitalization rate would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our reporting units by approximately million or million  respectively  at december  a increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate and resulting capitalization rate would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units by approximately million or million  respectively  at december  changes in our future revenue and cash flow projections  capital expenditure forecasts or anticipated market conditions  among other factors  could significantly impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill 
under the market approach  using both the guideline company method and the guideline transaction method  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units based on multiples of the cash free value of invested capital to revenues and ebitda 
the revenues and ebitda multiples of our reporting units were selected based on a comparison of our reporting units operating performance and margins  among other factors  to those of guideline companies 
in the market approach  we made certain judgments about the selection of guideline companies  comparable recent company sales transactions and transaction premiums 
although we based our fair value estimates under both the income approach and the market approach on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain 
in arriving at the final estimated fair values of each of our reporting units  the estimated fair values as calculated under both of the income approach and the market approach were multiplied by a weighting factor  the sum of which was the final estimated fair value 
the income approach was weighted and the two market approach methods were weighted each 
the income approach was weighted more heavily as the data included in that method is based on management s projections and forecasts whereas the two market approaches were weighted less heavily as the guideline companies and guideline transactions used in those models are not comparable to our reporting units being evaluated 
a increase or decrease in the weighting factor applied to the income approach combined with a total decrease in the two methods under the market approach would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units by approximately million at december  the change in the assumptions would not have changed our conclusion that the fair value exceeds the net book value for these reporting units 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we account for identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposition of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  shifts in technology  loss of key management or other personnel  significant negative industry or economic trends  and changes in our operating model or strategy and competitive forces 
in determining if an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair market value of the assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line basis or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from two to ten years 
our identifiable intangible assets were acquired primarily in connection with business combinations 
we have no indefinite lived intangible assets at december  member redemption liability member redemption liability for loyalty marketing points represents the estimated costs associated with mypoints obligation to redeem outstanding points accumulated by its loyalty marketing members as well as those points purchased by its advertisers for use in such advertisers promotion campaigns as they have been earned by mypoints members  less an allowance for points expected to expire prior to redemption 
the estimated cost of points is primarily presented in cost of revenues  except for the portion related to member acquisition activities  internal marketing surveys and other non revenue generating activities which are presented in sales and marketing expenses 
the member redemption liability is recognized when members earn points and is reduced when members redeem accumulated points upon reaching required redemption thresholds or when points are expired prior to redemption 
mypoints members may redeem points for third party gift cards and other rewards 
members earn points when they respond to direct marketing offers delivered by mypoints  purchase goods or services from advertisers  engage in certain promotional campaigns of advertisers or engage in other specified activities 
the member redemption liability is estimated based upon the weighted average cost and number of points that may be redeemed in the future 
on a monthly basis  the weighted average cost of points is calculated by taking the total cost of items fulfilled divided by total points redeemed 
the discounts and points needed to redeem vary by merchant and award denomination 
mypoints purchases gift cards and other awards from merchants at a discount and sets redemption levels for its members 
mypoints has the ability to adjust the number of points required to redeem awards to reflect changes in the cost of awards 
on a monthly basis  mypoints accounts for and reduces the gross points issued by an estimate of points that will never be redeemed by its members 
this reduction is calculated based on an analysis of historical point earning trends  redemption activities and individual member account activity  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for points and certain time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products and services to be delivered in the future 
mypoints historical analysis takes into consideration the total points in members accounts that have been inactive for six months or longer  less an estimated reactivation rate  plus an estimate of future inactive points 
changes in  among other factors  the net number of points issued  redemption activities and members activity levels could materially impact the member redemption liability 
a increase or decrease in the estimate of points that will never be redeemed would increase or decrease our member redemption liability at december  by approximately  points in active accounts do not expire 
however  under the terms and conditions of membership in mypoints loyalty marketing program  mypoints reserves the right to cancel or disable accounts and expire unredeemed points in accounts that are inactive for a period of twelve consecutive months 
for purposes of the member redemption liability  inactive means a lack of any of the following web site visit  email response  survey completion  profile update  or any point earning or point redeeming transaction 
the cancelling or disabling of inactive accounts would have no impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we fully consider inactive accounts when establishing the member redemption liability  as discussed above 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  a reconciliation of the changes in the member redemption liability in thousands year ended december  period from april  date of mypoints acquisition through december  beginning balance   accruals for points earned   reduction for redeemed points   changes in allowance for points expected to expire and weighted average cost of points revaluation of member redemption liability in connection with purchase accounting imputed interest on acquired member redemption liability ending balance   income taxes income taxes are accounted for under sfas no

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the computation of limitations relating to the amount of such tax assets  and the determination of appropriate valuation allowances relating to the realizability of such assets  are inherently complex and require the exercise of judgment 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assess the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets 
we apply the provisions of fasb interpretation no  or fin   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
under fin  we recognize  in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we record liabilities related to pending litigation when an unfavorable outcome is probable and management can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we do not record liabilities for pending litigation when there are uncertainties related to assessing either the amount or the probable outcome of the claims asserted in the litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we continually assess the potential liability related to such pending litigation 
subsidiary initial public offering of classmates media corporation in may  we announced our intention to explore the possibility of a subsidiary initial public offering  or ipo 
classmates media corporation  or cmc  was formed in august for the purposes of consolidating our classmates  the names database and mypoints business units and initiating a public equity offering 
the businesses were contributed to cmc by us on august  in august  cmc filed a form s registration statement with the sec for the ipo of its common stock 
in december  we determined that proceeding with the ipo under then current market conditions was not in the best interests of our stockholders and we withdrew cmc s form s registration statement previously filed with the sec 
approximately million of transaction costs were determined not to have continuing value after the withdrawal of the ipo and were expensed in the quarter ended december  it remains our strategy to complete an ipo of cmc 
as such  certain additional ipo transaction related costs totaling million associated with the ipo have been deferred and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  if we do not proceed with this strategy  these deferred costs will be expensed and included in the classmates media segment operating results as well as in our consolidated statements of operations in a future period 
results of operations the following tables set forth for the periods presented  selected historical statements of operations data 
the information contained in the tables below should be read in conjunction with liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations  and critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions included in this item as well as the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

classmates media segment income from operations for the year ended december  was impacted by expenses of million in connection with the proposed ipo of our cmc subsidiary 
communications segment income from operations for the year ended december  included restructuring charges of million and impairment charges of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues billable services revenues billable services revenues are comprised of amounts charged to pay accounts for our billable services 
classmates media billable services revenues consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for social networking services 
communications billable services revenues consist of amounts charged to pay accounts for internet access  email  web hosting  internet security  and other services  with substantially all of such revenues generated from internet access 
our billable services revenues are primarily dependent on two factors the average number of pay accounts for a period and the arpu 
the average number of pay accounts is a simple average calculated based on the number of pay accounts at the beginning and end of a period 
consolidated billable services revenues 
consolidated billable services revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in billable services revenues for the year ended december  was due to a decrease in revenues from our communications segment  partially offset by an increase in revenues from our classmates media segment 
billable services revenues related to our classmates media segment and our communications segment constituted and  respectively  of our consolidated billable services revenues for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  we anticipate that our consolidated billable services revenues will decline in as a result of an expected continued decline in communications billable services revenues which is expected to exceed the anticipated increase in classmates media billable services revenues  at least in the near term 
classmates media billable services revenues 
classmates media billable services revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in classmates media billable services revenues was due to a increase in our average number of pay accounts from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in the average number of pay accounts was primarily attributable to a classmates pay feature  our digital guestbook  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of international pay accounts 
the increase in classmates media billable services revenues due to pay accounts was partially offset by a decrease in arpu from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in arpu was primarily attributable to a greater overall proportion of international pay accounts compared to us pay accounts and the fact that pricing for our international social networking services is lower than for our classmates social networking services 
we anticipate our classmates media pay accounts and billable services revenues will continue to grow  at least in the near term 
communications billable services revenues 
communications billable services revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in communications billable services revenues was due to an decrease in our average number of pay accounts from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the average number of pay accounts was substantially attributable to a decrease in the number of dial up internet access pay accounts 
in addition  the decrease in revenues was partially due to a decrease in arpu from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in arpu was primarily attributable to an increased number of subscribers on lower priced subscription plans 
the decrease in dial up billable services revenues was partially offset by a million increase in versus in revenues from our dsl internet access service  which was launched in the december quarter 
we anticipate continued declines in our communications pay accounts and  potentially  arpu which will result in continued declines in communications billable services revenues 
advertising revenues we provide advertising solutions to marketers with both brand and direct response objectives through a full suite of display  search  email  and text link opportunities across our various properties 
we also use targeting technologies  web site sponsorships and web site integrations in order to provide effective solutions 
our social networking services generate advertising revenues primarily from display advertisements and from post transaction sales 
advertising inventory on our social networking web sites includes text and graphic placements on the user home page  profile page  class list page  and most other pages on our web sites 
we are able to target the advertising delivered to most of our members based on a wide variety of factors  including age  gender  demographic data  affiliations  profile data  and zip code 
post transaction sales are generated when a classmates pay account is provided a third party offer at the end of the pay account registration process 
we also sell a portion of our advertising inventory through third party advertising resellers 
our loyalty marketing service revenues are derived from advertising fees  consisting primarily of fees generated when emails are transmitted to members  when members respond to emails and when members complete online transactions 
we sell marketing solutions to advertisers with both brand and direct response objectives through a full suite of display  email and other advertising opportunities 
we also use targeting technologies and web site integrations in order to provide effective solutions for advertisers 
our communications services generate advertising revenues from our search agreement with yahoo  from display advertisements  from referring members to third party web sites or services  and from online market research 
substantially all of our communications advertising revenues are generated from our internet access services 
we host and customize the initial web site displayed to users of our internet access services 
this web site  or start page  displays sponsored links to a variety of content  products and services  including internet search 
we also display a toolbar on internet access users screens throughout their online access sessions that is generally visible regardless of the particular web site they visit 
the toolbar contains internet search functionality and a variety of buttons  icons and drop down menus 
a variety of advertising opportunities also exist through our email platforms  including display advertising on the main pages and within emails 
consolidated advertising revenues 
consolidated advertising revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising revenues in our classmates media segment and  to a lesser extent  also our communications segment 
advertising revenues related to our classmates media segment and our communications segment constituted and  respectively  of our consolidated advertising revenues for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended december  classmates media advertising revenues 
classmates media advertising revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to revenues from our loyalty marketing service  which we acquired in april and which was included in our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to only days for the year ended december  revenues from our loyalty marketing service increased by million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the fact that no such revenues were included in our consolidated financial statements in the first three months and nine days of the period prior to our acquisition of mypoints and an increase in the number of loyalty marketing active accounts in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our classmates media advertising revenues for the year ended december  also increased as a result of a million increase in advertising revenues  compared to the year ended december   generated from our social networking services

internal capitalized software development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due to a decrease in the number of development projects in compared to we anticipate that communications product development expenses will decline in when compared to as a result of a restructuring related reduction in the number of product development employees in this segment in october general and administrative general and administrative expenses include personnel related expenses for executive  finance  legal  human resources  facilities  and internal customer support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  accounting and financial services  office relocation costs  non income taxes  insurance  occupancy and other overhead related costs  and expenses incurred and credits received as a result of certain legal settlements 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses  in the aggregate and as a percentage of revenues  will increase significantly in when compared to at both the consolidated and the segment levels 
we anticipate the increase will be primarily as a result of an increase in stock based compensation 
we expect stock based compensation to increase as a result of several factors  including the likelihood that bonuses for certain members of senior management for the year ending december  the bonuses will be paid primarily in shares of our common stock whereas such bonuses were historically paid primarily in cash  the effect of shares of common stock and restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter of fiscal  and the effect of restricted stock units awarded in to members of senior management in connection with the renewal of employment agreements 
also  the resignation of an executive officer in resulted in the reversal in of stock based compensation recorded in prior periods which reduced stock based compensation associated with general and administrative expenses in the payment of the bonuses in shares of common stock as opposed to cash  while increasing stock based compensation  is not anticipated to have a significant impact on general and administrative expenses in consolidated general and administrative expenses

consolidated amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the accelerated amortization of intangible assets in earlier years associated with our classmates acquisition in november  partially offset by increased amortization related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the names database in march and our acquisition of mypoints in april restructuring charges in the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges totaling million 
in october  we eliminated positions and recorded restructuring charges totaling million within our communications segment to better align the segment s cost structure within a mature business for dial up internet access services

under sfas no

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based payment awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation related to stock options had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  other than as related to acquisitions  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant in order to calculate the amount of share based payment awards ultimately expected to vest

as stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and is based on equity awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
for the periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
accordingly  a pre tax cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment totaling million million  net of tax was recorded in the march quarter to adjust for share based payment awards granted prior to january  that are not ultimately expected to vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognized stock based compensation for equity awards with graded vesting by treating each vesting tranche as a separate award and recognizing compensation expense ratably for each tranche 
for equity awards granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we treat such awards as a single award and recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee service period 
in december  our compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all options to purchase our common stock with exercise prices in excess of 
these options were granted to executive officers and other employees 
options to purchase million shares of our common stock were subject to this acceleration and such options had exercise prices ranging from to  and had a weighted average exercise price of 
the acceleration of vesting of these out of the money options was undertaken primarily to eliminate any future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statements of operations with respect to these options with the implementation of sfas no 
r effective january  we estimated this compensation expense  before tax  would have totaled approximately million over the course of the original vesting periods 
ninety five percent of the options would have vested within approximately years from the effective date of the acceleration with the remaining vesting within approximately years from the date of acceleration 
we also believed that because the options to be accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the then current market value of our common stock  the options had limited economic value and were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
beginning in may  we shifted from a strategy of granting a combination of stock options and restricted stock units to solely granting restricted stock units and shares of our common stock 
additionally  in march  we offered eligible employees the opportunity to exchange any outstanding stock options granted to them  which had an exercise price per share of our common stock at or above the eligible options in return for restricted stock units 
the exchange offer expired in april  and approximately million shares of common stock underlying the eligible options were exchanged for restricted stock units covering approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options 
total expense associated with the exchange  prior to the consideration of expected forfeitures  was approximately million

amortization of intangible assets consolidated amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the accelerated amortization in of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of classmates in november  partially offset by increased amortization related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of the names database in march and mypoints in april impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment annually or when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that goodwill might be permanently impaired 
in the december quarter  we tested goodwill for impairment and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and an intangible assets impairment charge of million related to our photo sharing service within the communications segment 
the million intangible assets impairment charge was comprised of million of acquired software technology and million of acquired pay accounts  proprietary rights and domain names 
we determined the amount of the charge based on an estimate of the fair value of the photo sharing assets  using the income approach  discounted cash flow method 
we had no indefinite lived intangible assets at december  under sfas no 
 long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  must be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the december quarter  we recognized asset impairment charges of million attributable to certain assets of our voip services within the communications segment 
as a result of slower than expected growth of the voip market in the united states  current period operating losses and projected continuing operating losses  we evaluated the recoverability of certain assets and wrote off million of capitalized software and million of prepaid marketing and domain names 
we were required to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value and recognized asset impairment charges because the carrying value of the affected assets exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
see note impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets of the consolidated financial statements 
we determined that our goodwill was not impaired based on our annual test during the year ended december  in addition  we had no indefinite lived intangible assets at december  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of lower average balances on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  partially offset by higher yields in our short term investments portfolio 
net realized gains on our short term investments were not significant for the years ended december  and interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of decreases in interest expense and amortized deferred financing costs related to the term loan 
in january  we expensed the remaining million in deferred financing costs upon the repayment of the million balance of the term loan 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in imputed interest on the acquired member redemption liability of mypoints 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  net of federal benefit  compensation  including stock based compensation  that is limited under section m of the code  foreign losses  the benefit of which is not currently recognizable due to uncertainty regarding realization  the re measurement of deferred tax assets in new york  and employee stock purchase plan compensation  the benefit of which is not recognized under sfas no 
r but which is recognized upon a disqualified disposition 
this increase was completely offset by the benefit of federal tax exempt interest income 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  net of federal benefit  compensation  including stock based compensation  that is limited under section m of the code  foreign losses  the benefit of which is not currently recognizable due to uncertainty regarding realization  and the re measurement of deferred tax assets  including a change in new york state tax law 
cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax in the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax benefit million  net of tax as the cumulative effect of accounting change upon the adoption of sfas no 
r to recognize the effect of estimating the number of equity awards granted prior to january  that are not ultimately expected to vest 
liquidity and capital resources our total cash  cash equivalent and short term investments balances increased by million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  our summary cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used for investing activities  net cash used for financing activities   year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items  including  but not limited to  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  deferred taxes  tax benefits from equity awards and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase from was primarily due to favorable net operating assets and liabilities changes of million and a million increase in net income  partially offset by a million decrease in non cash items 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used for investing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following a million increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  and a million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions 
we acquired mypoints in april for million  net of cash acquired  we acquired the names database in march for million  net of cash acquired  and we paid the remaining million due in connection with the acquisition of our photo sharing business in march we have invested significantly in our network infrastructure  software licenses  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment and we will need to make further significant investments in the future 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
we anticipate that our total capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures may fluctuate due to a number of factors including  without limitation  potential future acquisitions and new business initiatives  which are difficult to predict and which could change significantly over time 
additionally  technological advances may require us to make capital expenditures to develop or acquire new equipment or technology in order to replace aging or technologically obsolete equipment 
net cash used for financing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in january  we paid  in full  the outstanding balance on our term loan of million 
the decrease in net cash used for financing activities was partially offset by a million increase in the payment of dividends and a million increase in repurchases of common stock in connection with shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units to pay applicable employee withholding taxes 
in february  april  july  and october  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividends were paid on february   may   august   and november  and totaled million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in january  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
the record date for the dividend was february  and the dividend will be paid on february  the payment of future dividends is discretionary and is subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance and other factors 
the payment of dividends will negatively impact cash flows from financing activities 
future cash flows from financing activities may also be affected by our repurchases of our common stock 
our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program the program that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions based on prevailing market conditions and other factors through december  from august through december   we had repurchased a total of million of our common stock under the program 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program in  and at december   the remaining amount available under the program was million 
cash flows from financing activities may also be negatively impacted by the withholding of a portion of shares underlying the restricted stock units we award to employees 
upon vesting  we currently do not collect the applicable employee withholding taxes for restricted stock units from employees 
instead  we automatically withhold  from the restricted stock units that vest  the portion of those shares with a fair market value equal to the amount of the employee withholding taxes due 
we then pay the applicable withholding taxes in cash 
the withholding of these shares  although accounted for as a common stock repurchase  does not reduce the amount available under the program 
similar to repurchases of common stock under the program  the net effect of such withholding will adversely impact our cash flows from financing activities 
the amounts remitted in the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  for which we withheld  shares and  shares of common stock  respectively  that were underlying the restricted stock units 
the amount we pay in future quarters will vary based on our stock price and the number of restricted stock units vesting during the quarter 
on august   classmates and mypoints declared a dividend to us  which was evidenced by unsecured notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of million the notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly in arrears 
no principal is due on the notes until maturity on august   but the notes may be repaid in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity without penalty 
historically  our net cash provided by operating activities has been positively impacted by our classmates and mypoints businesses which have been transferred to cmc 
we attempted to effect an ipo of cmc in the fourth quarter of however  we withdrew cmc s form s registration statement previously filed with the sec for the proposed ipo in december due to then current market conditions 
it remains our strategy to complete an ipo of cmc 
if such an ipo occurs  the notes may be repaid in whole or in part from the proceeds from the offering  although there can be no assurance that the ipo will occur or that the notes will be repaid 
if the ipo were to occur  it is likely that the net cash provided by operating  investing and financing activities associated with cmc will remain with cmc and will not be available for our use 
as such  cash flows available to us may significantly decrease if an ipo of cmc is consummated 
based on our current projections  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations  at least in the near term 
we intend to use our existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund  among other things  dividend payments  if declared by our board of directors  to develop and acquire other services  businesses or technologies  to repurchase shares of our common stock if we believe market conditions to be favorable and it to be in our strategic interests  to repurchase our common stock underlying restricted stock units and pay the employee withholding taxes due on vested restricted stock units  and to fund future capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that our future cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investments balances will be sufficient to fund our operations over the next year  and in the near term we do not anticipate the need for additional financing to fund our operations 
however  we may raise debt or equity capital for a variety of reasons including  without limitation  developing new or enhancing existing services or products  repurchasing our common stock  acquiring other services  businesses or technologies or funding significant capital expenditures 
if we need to raise capital through public or private debt or equity financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements  this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise sufficient capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  and could impair our ability to pay future dividends  if declared by our board of directors 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage of stock owned by the then current stockholders could be reduced 
furthermore  such equity or debt securities that we issue might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to holders of our common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  deferred taxes  tax benefits from equity awards  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the year over year decrease was primarily the result of the following a million increase in other items including a million increase in cash paid for legal settlements and a million increase in net amortization on short term investments  and a million unfavorable operating assets and liabilities change  including a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to decreases in internet access pay accounts  a million decrease in other liabilities  a million increase in accounts receivable  and a million increase in other assets 
the unfavorable operating assets and liabilities change was partially offset by an increase of million in the member redemption liability related to our loyalty marketing service  which we acquired in april the negative impact on working capital from the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances was due to a million year over year reduction in the change in income taxes payable  a million year over year reduction in the change in accrued employee bonuses due to the timing of bonus payments  including the payment of bonuses associated with the mypoints acquisition  a million year over year reduction in the change in sales and marketing accruals primarily due to a reduction in media and other advertising costs associated with our communications segment  and a net year over year reduction in other payables and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors 
net cash used for investing activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following a million increase in cash paid for acquisitions 
we acquired mypoints in april for million  net of cash acquired  we acquired the names database in march for million  net of cash acquired  and we paid the remaining million due in connection with the acquisition of our photo sharing service in march compared to the initial payment of million in march a million net decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments  a million escrow deposit for the settlement of a pre acquisition liability related to our juno online services  inc subsidiary in the september quarter  and a million increase in purchases of property and equipment 
these increases in uses of cash were partially offset by a million decrease in purchases of rights  patents and trademarks  primarily related to the purchase of proprietary rights associated with the netzero trademark for million  million of which was paid in the march quarter 
the remaining million was paid in january we have invested significantly in our network infrastructure  software licenses  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment and we will need to make further significant investments in the future 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
net cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following a million increase in dividend payments  and an million increase in payments on our term loan 
in january  we paid  in full  the outstanding balance of the term loan of million 
the increases in uses of cash were offset by an million decrease in repurchases of common stock  a million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  and a million increase in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  which requires a portion of the tax benefits from stock based compensation to be presented in financing activities versus its historical presentation in operating activities 
in  our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock for a total of million 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands total less than year year to less than years years to less than years more than years capital leases operating leases     telecommunications purchases    media purchases   member redemption liability  long term   total      includes  of imputed interest 
the operating lease obligations shown in the table have not been reduced by minimum non cancelable sublease rentals aggregating million 
we remain secondarily liable under these leases in the event that any sublessee defaults under the sublease terms 
we do not believe that material payments will be required as a result of our secondary responsibilities 
at december   we had gross unrealized tax benefits of approximately million  all of which  if recognized  would have an impact on our effective tax rate 
commitments under standby letters of credit at december  are scheduled to expire as follows in thousands total less than year year to less than years years to less than years more than years standby letters of credit   standby letters of credit are maintained pursuant to certain of our lease arrangements 
the standby letters of credit remain in effect at declining levels through the terms of the related leases 
other commitments in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  business partners  and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of such agreements  services to be provided by us  or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers and employees that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors  officers or employees 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers and employees  and former officers  directors and employees of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business  principally risk associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk as well as market rate risk primarily related to our short term investments portfolio 
as a result  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we maintain a short term investments portfolio consisting  at times  of us commercial paper  us corporate notes  us government or us government agencies obligations  and municipal securities  including auction rate securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our short term investments portfolio 
our primary objective in managing our short term investments is the preservation of principal and liquidity while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
the minimum long term credit rating is a  and if a long term credit rating is not available  we require a minimum short term credit rating of a and p furthermore  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our short term investments  at times in both fixed rate and variable rate interest earning instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal by selling securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our short term investments at december  consisted solely of municipal securities 
as a result of the recent adverse conditions in the us credit markets  we liquidated  without any losses in principal  our investments in auction rate securities and did not hold any auction rate securities in our portfolio as of december  we classify all of our short term investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
as of december   unrealized gains in our short term investments aggregated  we did not have any unrealized losses in our short term investments at december  during the year ended december   our short term investments portfolio yielded an annual effective interest rate of and an annual taxable equivalent yield of 
if interest rates were to decrease basis points throughout the year  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our short term investments and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
foreign currency risk we transact business in different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the indian rupee inr and the euro  which may result in a gain or loss of earnings to us 
the volatilities of the inr and the euro and all other applicable foreign currencies are monitored by us throughout the year 
we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange rates translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
when the functional currencies of our foreign operations are denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact our operating results 
foreign currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in our foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency are included in operating expenses 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december  was not material to our consolidated results of operations 
while we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging  we may in the future use hedging programs  including currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly utilized to reduce financial market risks  if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk
