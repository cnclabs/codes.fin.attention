item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading producer of innovative satellite and other wireless communications and networking systems to government and commercial customers 
our ability to apply technologies between government and commercial customers combined with our diversification of technologies  products and customers  provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced wireless communications and networking technologies 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the networking and global satellite communications equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for our government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications solutions incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
in fiscal year  we announced a change in the composition of our segments to reflect the realignment of the organization with our recent strategic initiatives 
we conduct our business through three segments government systems  commercial networks and satellite services 
prior fiscal year information has been recast to facilitate comparisons to the newly established reportable segments 
government systems our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes data links  including mids terminals  mids jtrs development and unmanned vehicle technologies  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  and government satellite communication systems and products  including uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and innovative broadband solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
commercial networks the commercial networks segment offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs based technology  mobile broadband products and systems for airborne  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise vsat networks products  satellite networking systems design and technology development  and antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers 
with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction  and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating  and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we have developed products addressing five key broadband markets enterprise  consumer  in flight  maritime and ground mobile applications 

table of contents satellite services satellite services segment encompasses three primary areas managed broadband services  mobile broadband services and wholesale bandwidth services 
for everyday enterprise networking or backup protection for primary networks  our managed broadband service provides a combination of terrestrial and satellite connections through an around the clock call center and network management operation to ensure customer network availability and reliable digital satellite communications 
our mobile broadband service includes network management services for our customers who utilize our arclight based mobile communication systems  also through our network management center 
in  we began construction of a high speed ka band satellite in order to provide wholesale broadband services over north america 
we currently plan to launch this satellite in early and introduce service later in sources of revenues to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price  comprised approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year and of revenues during fiscal years and as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop  manufacture and provide services related to satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communication and networking equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support our business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to our industry 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
our annual awards have progressively grown from approximately million to approximately million over the past six years 
the awards growth each of the past five years and the conversion of certain of the awards has contributed to our revenue growth 
during fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of jast  sa jast  a switzerland based  privately held developer of microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and satellite applications  specializing in small  low profile antennas for mobile satellite communications 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of jast from the date of acquisition in our commercial networks segment 
during our fiscal years and  we completed the acquisitions of efficient channel coding  inc ecc  enerdyne technologies  inc enerdyne and intelligent compression technologies  inc ict 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the operating results of ecc  enerdyne and ict have been included from the dates of acquisition in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over time and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
in the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   we recorded losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe that we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future cost on our programs through regular quarterly evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis 
however  a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
for example  a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of march  would change our pre tax income by approximately  we also have contracts and customer purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products in accordance with sab  staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish objective and reliable evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation at march   we had stock based compensation plans described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we grant options to purchase our common stock and award restricted stock units to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment 
effective april   we used the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of stock based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date  which are subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended march  was million  million and  for employee stock options including stock options assumed in business combination  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended march  was million  million and  for employee stock options  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
at march   there was million  million and  in unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested stock options  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  years and less than six months  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas r  we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of all stock based awards was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model as well for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under sfas the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under sfas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our stock based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r  the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  share based payment and sab no 
sab  year end help for expensing employee stock options  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of stock based compensation expense can be significant to our financial statements  but this expense is based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in sfas r  sab and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 

table of contents theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for stock based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 
our expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate 
the estimated volatility for stock options and employee stock purchase rights is based on the historical volatility calculated using the daily stock price of our stock over a recent historical period equal to the expected term 
the risk free interest rate that we use in determining the fair value of our stock based awards is based on the implied yield on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of our stock based awards 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the calculation using the simplified method for plain vanilla options applied consistently to all plain vanilla options  consistent with the guidance in sab in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued sab to amend the sec s views discussed in sab regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with sfas r 
due to significant changes in our option terms in october of and lack of sufficient history  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab  as amended by sab for the expected option life  we have what sab defines as plain vanilla stock options  and therefore use a simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term for options as permitted by sab the weighted average expected life of employee stock options granted during the fiscal year ended march   derived from the simplified method was years 
the expected term or life of employee stock purchase rights issued represents the expected period of time from the date of grant to the estimated date that the stock purchase right under our employee stock purchase plan would be fully exercised 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers comprise a larger part of our revenues 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of march  warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on a majority of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
we classify the amounts we expect to incur within twelve months as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill under sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
the only reporting units which have goodwill assigned to them are the businesses which were acquired and have been included in our commercial segment 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 

table of contents we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 
satellite and other property and equipment satellite and other property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  except for construction in progress projects 
currently  we have one satellite under construction  viasat costs are capitalized as incurred and include construction  launch and insurance 
satellite construction and launch services are generally procured under long term contracts that provide for payments by us over the contract periods 
satellite construction and launch services costs are capitalized to reflect progress toward completion  which typically coincides with contract milestone payment schedules 
insurance premiums related to satellite launches and subsequent in orbit testing are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the satellite 
performance incentives payable in future periods are dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellite in service 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairments 
income taxes management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
on march   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of our business there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision 
we believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
however  if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense would result 

table of contents valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from prior acquisitions are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from eight months to ten years

the expected amortization expense of long lived acquired intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to higher average invested cash balances year over year

dollar percentage years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages segment operating profit percentage of segment revenues the slight decrease in government systems segment operating profit dollars was related to higher ir d expenses of million and higher sg a expenses of million from higher selling and support costs 
additional contribution to decrease in operating profit was due to non cash stock based compensation charges of million in fiscal year and increased cost of revenues as a percent of sales primarily from our mids product group totaling approximately million 
these higher costs were offset by an increase in revenues of million from fiscal year to fiscal year 
table of contents commercial networks segment revenues 
dollar percentage years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages revenues the increase in commercial networks segment revenues reflects higher sales of consumer broadband products of approximately million offset by certain mobile broadband sales decreases of approximately million 
the overall higher sales of commercial networks equipment revenue reflects higher customer awards stemming from greater market acceptance of our products  the conversion of those awards to revenue  more favorable market conditions in the commercial telecommunications market for our products and further development of our consumer satellite broadband systems 
segment operating profit 
dollar percentage years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages segment operating profit loss percentage of segment revenues our operating profit growth of million was primarily driven by improved performance of consumer broadband products which contributed to product cost reduction of approximately million 
this increase was offset by lower margins from our antenna systems products from development cost overruns of approximately million 
additionally  our commercial networks segment had increased ir d expenses of approximately million to support development of next generation vsat equipment and other market opportunities and had increased non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
satellite services segment revenues 
dollar percentage years ended increase increase march  march  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages revenues our emerging satellite services segment experienced slight increase in revenues year over year 
these revenues were primarily derived from service arrangements supporting both the mobile broadband and managed networks services markets

table of contents backlog as reflected in the table below  funded and firm funded plus unfunded backlog decreased during fiscal year primarily due to some large contract awards that shifted from fiscal year into fiscal year new contract awards in the current fiscal year were a record for the company 
march  march  in millions firm backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total funded backlog government systems segment commercial networks segment satellite services segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
over the last year  as more of our products have been placed into market  we have seen a greater percentage of awards from book and ship type orders  resulting in backlog growth rate that is relatively lower than the previous three fiscal years 
total new awards for commercial  defense and satellite services products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing and equity financing 
the general cash needs of our government systems  commercial networks and satellite services segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts ie product or service  development or production  and timing of payments in backlog  the quality of the customer ie ie government or commercial  domestic or international and the duration of the contract 
in addition  for all three of our segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government systems segment tend to be more a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  us government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the contract 
in the commercial networks and satellite services segments  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer will typically affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial networks and satellite services environment tends to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year of million is primarily related to a year over year increase of operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by higher year over year net income of million and an increase in adjustments to net income for non cash add backs of million 
accounts receivable increased by million from prior fiscal year end due to increased shipments in our government systems and commercial networks segments resulting from revenue growth and the achievement of program milestones 
at the end of fiscal year  a customer withheld approximately million in receivables payments until after year end and these payments were received shortly after year end 
had we received those payments  accounts receivable would have increased approximately million and cash provided by operating activities would have been million 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to acquisition activities million in cash paid to certain former ecc stockholders under the terms of the acquisition agreement for ecc   in cash paid to former stockholders of enerdyne under the terms of the enerdyne acquisition agreement and approximately  in cash paid for the acquisition of jast on the closing date under the terms of the jast acquisition agreement 
in addition  approximately million in cash outflow relates to capital expenditures for the fiscal year  of which million relates to the viasat satellite  a million increase compared to fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to million for fiscal year the majority of the activity for both years is due to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options  stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan and cash inflows related to the incremental tax benefit from stock based compensation slightly offset  in fiscal year  by the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement for certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards during the third quarter of fiscal year fiscal year also includes million related to proceeds from a secured borrowing arrangement  we entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal year under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a note receivable from a customer to serve as collateral for the obligation under a borrowing 
the arrangement also included recourse to certain other assets of the company in the event of customer default on the note receivable 
no significant guarantees beyond the recourse provisions exist 
this secured borrowing arrangement does not qualify as a sale of assets under fas no

the additional purchase price consideration of million was recorded as additional goodwill in commercial networks segment in the first quarter of fiscal year as of march   in connection with our enerdyne acquisition and under the terms of the enerdyne acquisition agreement  we owed an additional consideration amount to the former enerdyne stockholders in the amount of million  which was accrued and recorded as additional goodwill in the government systems segment as of march  the million was payable in cash and stock in accordance with certain terms of the arrangement  in may accordingly  on may   we paid million of additional consideration to the former stockholders of enerdyne  which was comprised of  shares of common stock and  in cash 
in january  we entered into several agreements with space systems loral ss l  loral space communications loral and telesat canada telesat related to our anticipated high capacity satellite system 
under the satellite construction contract with ss l  we will purchase viasat  a new broadband satellite designed by us and to be constructed by ss l for approximately million  subject to purchase price adjustments based on satellite performance 
we do not believe the purchase price paid by us to ss l for the viasat satellite will materially change 
in addition  we entered into a beam sharing agreement with loral  whereby loral is responsible for contributing of the total costs estimated at approximately million associated with the viasat satellite project 
as part of this arrangement  loral executed a separate contract with ss l whereby loral is purchasing the canadian beams on the viasat satellite loral beams for approximately million of the total satellite cost of million 
in addition  loral remains responsible under the beam sharing agreement to reimburse us for costs associated with launch  launch and in orbit insurance  and operating the satellite 
the reimbursed costs payable to us from loral for launch and insurance are expected to be approximately million 

table of contents the projected total cost of the viasat project  including the satellite  launch  insurance and related gateway infrastructure  through satellite launch is estimated at million  and will depend on the timing of the gateway infrastructure roll out 
we have a current strategy that would limit our total required investment 
our equity participation will be similar to our current cash and cash equivalents and the remaining amount would be funded by equity contributions from outside parties and or debt collateralized by the satellite 
alternatively  we believe we have adequate sources of funding for the project  which includes our cash on hand  available borrowing capacity and the cash we expect to generate over the next few years 
we believe this provides us flexibility to execute this project in an appropriate manner and obtain outside equity in the range indicated under terms that we consider reasonable 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  principally related to contract performance  leaving borrowing availability under our line of credit of million 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on january   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility the facility which was amended on january   extending the term of the facility to april  and amended again on april   extending the term of the facility to july  borrowings under the facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of million  including up to million of letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at our option  at either the lender s prime rate or at libor london interbank offered rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property assets 
the facility contains financial covenants that set a minimum ebitda limit for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter at million  a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at million and a minimum quick ratio sum of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities  divided by current liabilities as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at to 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants at march  in april  we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of up to an additional million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
additionally  we had available million of these securities  which were previously registered under shelf registration statements we filed in june and september up to an aggregate of million of the securities may now be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of cash required for the viasat satellite project and any future broadband satellite project we may engage in  expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities

the changes to be effected with sfas r from the current guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs will be recognized as expenses separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value  all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as non controlling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january   except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations  which previously were adjusted to goodwill  will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after january   regardless of the date of the original business combination

sab which amends sab no 
sab share based payment which provided a simplified approach for estimating the expected term of a plain vanilla option  which is required for application of the black scholes model and other models for valuing stock options 
at the time  the staff acknowledged that  for companies choosing not to rely on their own historical option exercise data ie  because such data did not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the term  information about exercise patterns with respect to plain vanilla options granted by other companies might not be available in the near term  accordingly  in sab  the staff permitted use of a simplified approach for estimating the term of plain vanilla options granted on or before december  the information concerning exercise behavior that the staff contemplated would be available by such date has not materialized for many companies 
thus  in sab  the staff continues to allow use of the simplified rule for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla options until such time as the relevant data do become widely available 
the simplified method is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each vesting tranche of awards 
the mid point between the vesting date and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method 
sab is effective january  we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to significant changes in our stock option terms in october of we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term obligations including the revolving line of credit 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
as of march   there was no foreign currency exchange contract outstanding 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros
