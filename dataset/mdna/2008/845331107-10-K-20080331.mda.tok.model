item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities for additional information 
environmental and water quality risks our services group is subject to environmental and water quality risks 
we operate facilities on behalf of our clients under contract 
these facilities must be operated in accordance with various federal and state water quality standards 
we also handle certain hazardous materials at these facilities  such as chlorine gas and hydrogen sulfide 
any failures of our operation of the facilities  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous material leaks and spills  and similar events  could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
escalating costs our operating costs  construction costs and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues 
many of our contracts with municipalities include contractual price increases tied to national consumer price indices 
however  our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase significantly higher than a generalized price index 
the largest component of our operating costs is made up of salaries and wages 
these costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor 
other large components of our costs are general liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  employee benefits and health insurance costs 
these costs may increase at rates higher than the applicable general price index based on our actual claims incurred experience and therefore may result in a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
contract cancellations our operations and maintenance contracts may be canceled  reducing our revenues and service backlog 
also  we may not secure new construction and construction management projects on a consistent basis  leading to fluctuations in revenues and backlog 
our service group revenue backlog consists of new and existing contracts 
we include new contracts in the backlog when we have a signed contract 
revenues included in our backlog may be realized over a multi year period 
the contracts signed by our services group typically have durations of three to five years and some are cancelable with to days prior notice 
the uncompleted portion of base revenue for these existing contracts is reflected in the backlog 
although our services group tends to experience high renewal rates  municipalities and cities periodically change operators or terminate outsourcing at the end of a contract 
the inability to renew existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our services group 
in addition  a municipality could cancel a long term contract without notice 
this would result in loss of revenues and operating profits and may result in litigation if a breach of contract occurs 
regulatory environment changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect our results of operations 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by governmental agencies 
in some states  regulators are elected by popular vote  and the results of elections may change the rules and policies of the agency 
changes in rules and policies  including policies allowing our services group to provide operations and maintenance  construction and construction management services to our regulated utilities at fair market value  may adversely impact our operating results 
other risk factors capital resources our capital resources may restrict our ability to operate and expand our business 
we may be unable to renew our credit facilities when they expire 
we may be unable to execute additional financing alternatives at terms that we find acceptable 
if we are unable to renew our existing lines of credit  or if we are unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending would be reduced or delayed and any future acquisitions would also be delayed or eliminated  which could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth and profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities for additional information 
debt covenants we are subject to debt covenants 
we are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under some of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing  and we could face penalties  increased borrowing costs  litigation  acceleration of maturity schedules and cross default issues 
such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
geographic diversity our operations are subject to certain risks due to their location 
we own or operate water and wastewater facilities in numerous locations in numerous states and  consequently  we are subject to widely differing weather  political  water supply  labor supply  utility cost  regulatory  economic and other risks in the areas we service 
we cannot control these risks 
internal control weaknesses internal control weaknesses could have an adverse effect on us 
insufficient internal controls could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements  misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
controls that function effectively today may become inadequate due to changes in conditions 
information technology we rely on a number of complex business systems that could malfunction 
our businesses are dependent on several complex business systems that must function reliably in order for us to operate effectively 
among other things  system malfunctions could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities  billing accurately and timely analyzing financial results 
our profitability and cash flow could be impacted negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively 
we are working on migrating all of the legacy applications to a single integrated software and hardware platform 
we may also experience malfunctions during this migration process 
uninsured risks we retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies 
we evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually 
our evaluation considers the costs  risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage 
retained risks are associated with deductible limits  partial self insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings 
we cannot assure you that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained or that such uninsured losses will not affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations

item legal proceedings new mexico utilities  inc 
new mexico utilities  inc nmui  one of southwest water s wholly owned regulated utilities  has an agreement with the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority  a political subdivision of the state of new mexico the water authority  whereby the water authority treats the effluent from nmui s wastewater collection system for a fee 
the treated effluent is returned to the rio grande underground basin  creating return flow credits 
return flow credits supplement nmui s existing water rights  enabling it to pump additional water from the basin 
in august  the water authority increased the fee charged to nmui  using a different formula than had been used to calculate fee increases in prior years 
the company believes the increase violates the terms of a written agreement between the parties 
subsequently  the water authority also claimed ownership of the return flow credits 
the company filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the second judicial district court  county of bernalillo  state of new mexico  requesting that the court settle these disputes 
in a letter ruling dated may   the court ruled that the water authority could use a new formula to set fees for nmui 
southwest water filed a motion for reconsideration and that motion was denied on october  the matter has now been set for trial in the fall of the court has not ruled on whether the new rate was appropriate  has made no determination as to any amount nmui may owe to the water authority  or ruled on the ownership of the return flow credits 
although we cannot give any assurances as to the ultimate resolution of this matter  we do not believe that it is probable we will be required to pay the disputed fees and related late payment penalties  which totaled million as of december   and have not recognized a reserve for any potential liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  should the court rule against nmui  the new mexico public regulation commission has indicated its support of nmui s proposal that it be permitted to establish a regulatory asset for any amounts paid  including late payment penalties  and recover that asset prospectively through a rate surcharge to its customers 
we are unable to predict the impact the resolution of the return flow credits ownership dispute will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  nmui received a million retroactive billing adjustment from the water authority covering the period from august through april for the volume of wastewater it believes nmui discharged into the treatment system versus the amount reported by nmui 
the amounts reported by nmui were based on a calculation methodology that had been agreed to by both parties and used for approximately years 
nmui is contesting the billing adjustment 
although we cannot give any assurances as to the ultimate resolution of this matter  we do not believe that it is probable we will be required to pay the retroactive billing and therefore have not recognized a reserve for any potential liability for this amount in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on february   we were made aware of a claim of lien filed by the water authority against nmui in the sum of million  allegedly for delinquent sewer charges 
this lien is related to the above described matters currently being litigated in new mexico state court 
in addition  on january   the water authority and the city of rio rancho  a home rule municipal corporation  as petitioners  filed a petition for condemnation against nmui and others  as defendants  in the second judicial district court  county of bernalillo  state of new mexico the petition 
the petition seeks to acquire  by condemnation  all of the assets of nmui  including all real property  through the stated power of eminent domain 
the petition also alleges that the petitioners need to acquire the nmui assets for the public purposes of providing water and wastewater services to nmui customers and that the acquisition of nmui is necessary  appropriate and in the public interest 
southwest water is contesting the petition and the matter is scheduled for trial in the fall of if southwest water does not prevail  the petitioners must pay fair market value for the utility as determined by the court  based on appraisals 
nmui and the petitioners do not agree on the value of the assets which the petitioners seek to condemn 
while it is too early to predict the outcome of this matter  we believe that the fair market value of nmui exceeds its recorded net book value as of december  suburban water systems suburban water systems  one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  and the company were named as defendants in several lawsuits alleging various injuries as a result of water contamination in the san gabriel valley main basin 
the california supreme court ruled in february that the plaintiffs could not challenge the adequacy of the water quality standards established by california department of health services 
in august  the case against southwest water and its subsidiary was dismissed  however  the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the court of appeals for the state of california  first appellate district dca civil no 
b 
oral arguments for the appeal were presented on june  and the company and the other defendants prevailed at the appellate level 
the court ruled that the only time a regulated water utility or public water company can be held liable in tort for water quality issues is when they have violated a numerical standard set by the department of health services or other similar regulatory agency 
liability insurance carriers have absorbed all costs related to the lawsuits and appeals 
the parties have entered into a settlement agreement which provides  in part  that no further appeals will be filed  effectively ending this litigation 
investigations on may   eco resources  inc eco  one of southwest waters operating subsidiaries  received a subpoena to provide records to a grand jury 
the requested records relate to the operations of the san simeon wastewater treatment plant in california for the period january to the date of the subpoena 
eco has operated this facility since september the facility was also served with search warrants executed by the epa 
we cooperated fully with the investigation and the investigation was closed without further action in february southwest water received a letter dated january  from the california state water resources control board office of enforcement the board 
the letter indicates that the board has conducted an investigation of the operations of eco with respect to various california wastewater treatment facilities which are operated  but not owned  by eco 
the board alleges that eco has violated certain provisions of the california water code and may be subject to civil administrative liability in excess of million  and possible administrative action against eco s status as a contract operator in california 
while we believe that the summary allegations cannot be substantiated  we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the board or the effect those actions may have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we intend to aggressively defend against this action 
no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  penalties or other liabilities 
on may   the epa executed a search warrant at southwest water s texas based testing laboratory and on july  the laboratory received a subpoena to provide additional records and information to a grand jury 
we have cooperated fully with the investigation and have provided the records requested 
there have been no further significant developments since july  other matters southwest water and our subsidiaries are also involved in other routine legal and administrative proceedings arising during the ordinary course of business

overview southwest water company provides a broad range of services including water production  treatment and distribution  wastewater collection and treatment  utility billing and collection  utility infrastructure construction management  and public works services 
we own regulated public utilities and also serve cities  utility districts and private companies under contract 
our subsidiaries are segmented into two operating groups our utility group and our services group 
utility group our utility group owns public water and wastewater utilities in alabama  california  new mexico  oklahoma and texas and  beginning in february  mississippi 
except for our california utility  our utilities are operated by companies in our services group  which we describe below 
state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations 
the rates that our regulated utility subsidiaries charge for water and wastewater usage are established by state or local authorities 
utility group revenues reflect fees earned for the production and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of sewage for residential  business  industrial and public authority use 
the group s operating expenses reflect the costs associated with purchasing  producing and distributing water  collecting and treating wastewater  salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
services group our services group operates our contract service businesses in which we operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities owned by cities  public agencies  municipal utility districts  private entities and investor owned utilities  including most of our own utilities 
our services group operates primarily in alabama  california  colorado  georgia  mississippi  new mexico  south dakota and texas 
while state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations  our services group s pricing is not subject to regulation 
services group revenues reflect fees earned for water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services  equipment maintenance and repair  sewer pipeline cleaning  billing and collection services  public works and state certified water and wastewater laboratory analysis 
our services group also facilitates the design  construction  project management and operating aspects of various water and wastewater projects 
the group s operating expenses reflect salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
most work performed by the services group is required to be performed by state licensed and certified technicians 
some companies in our services group provide construction  operations and maintenance services to our utility group and recognize a profit on those services 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  we do not eliminate the services group s profit because management believes the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future utility group revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we do  however  eliminate revenues to the extent of the related costs in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance provided in sfas selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to personnel  facilities  insurance  consulting and professional services  which support our sales  marketing  human resources  finance and administration functions for the entire company 
effects of inflation for our utility group  recovery for the effects of inflation through higher rates is dependent upon receiving adequate and timely rate increases 
for our service group  most of our contacts have provisions for rate increases tied to the rate of inflation 
however  rate increases are not retroactive and often lag increases in costs caused by inflation 
during periods of moderate inflation  as has been experienced in and  the effects of inflation have had an impact on our results of operations 
acquisitions  assets held for sale and dispositions our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been affected by our history of acquisitions and  in  a disposition 
our most recent significant acquisitions  which affect the comparability of the historical financial condition and results of operations described in the md a  are utility group a shelby county  alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system servicing approximately  connections in september  a denton county  texas based water utility serving approximately connections in october  two austin  texas based water utilities serving connections in  a northern mississippi based water and wastewater utility serving approximately water connections and servicing approximately wastewater connections through four collection systems in february  two san antonio  texas based water utilities serving approximately  connections in may  a madison county  alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system servicing approximately connections in november  and services group a birmingham  alabama based contract operations company in march in january  we also acquired another birmingham  alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system that services approximately  residential and commercial connections in a service area directly adjacent to our existing shelby county collection and treatment system 
during  we elected to sell a wholesale water and wastewater operation in texas and believe the sale can be consummated during as a result of this decision  the operation is classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and the discussion below reflects only continuing operations for all periods 
in june we sold master tek international  inc  our submetering business that provided multi family residential utility metering  billing and collection services for residential properties 
the sale of this business  which was part of our services group  has not affected the operations of our remaining businesses in the services group or our utility group 
as a result of the sale  the business we sold is also reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for and the discussion below reflects only continuing operations 
new mexico eminent domain condemnation proceedings in  the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority and the city of rio rancho  new mexico  filed a petition for condemnation the petition against our new mexico regulated utility  new mexico utilities  inc nmui 
the petition seeks to acquire  by condemnation  all of the assets of nmui  including all real property  through the alleged power of eminent domain 
the petition also alleges that the petitioners need to acquire the utility assets for the public purposes of providing water and wastewater services to customers and that the acquisition of nmui is necessary  appropriate and in the public interest 
we believe we have defenses to the action which we intend to vigorously assert 
if we do not prevail  the petitioners must pay fair market value as determined by the court  based on appraisals 
nmui and the petitioners do not agree on the value of the assets which the petitioners seek to condemn 
while it is too early to predict the outcome of this matter  we believe that the fair market value of the nmui utility exceeds its recorded net book value as of december  see item legal proceedings for additional information 
business outlook the water and wastewater industry generates annual revenues in excess of billion in the united states 
both services are primarily owned by government municipalities 
growing regulatory complexity and escalating water quality awareness has led to a dwindling supply of low cost potable water 
the market is characterized by an aging and deteriorating municipal infrastructure and there is minimal state and federal government funding available to upgrade these systems to meet the higher standards 
the epa estimates that an investment of billion to trillion may be needed over the next years to meet the higher standards 
these factors lead us to a very positive outlook for growth in our industry as more government entities look to the private sector to help them meet these challenges 
we intend to grow our market share of this industry by focusing on both increasing the number of utilities we own and on increasing the dollars generated by operating and maintaining government owned utilities 
our long term strategic plan is to increase our profitability through acquisitions and organic growth in both our utility group and our services group 
the utility group growth strategy focuses on strategically located acquisitions  organic customer growth and actively managed rate proceedings 
we look to acquire strategic utilities located within our geographic footprint  thereby expanding our presence in a region and gaining economies of scale 
we also look to acquire utilities in population growth areas 
historically  our utilities in population growth areas experience new development in their service areas which generates organic growth through increased customer connections 
to ensure a reasonable rate of return on investments in our capital assets  we manage rate proceedings through our relationships with public utility commissions 
the services group growth strategy focuses on expanding our client base  making strategic acquisitions and providing peripheral services such as construction of infrastructure  billing and collection services  customer care call centers  meter replacement and laboratory analysis of water and wastewater samples 
by pursuing new operations and maintenance contracts with cities  municipalities and private owners of water and wastewater utilities within our geographic footprint  we expand our presence in a region and gain economies of scale 
we look to expand the scope of our contracts with current clients by adding additional services such as billing and collections and providing capital improvement project management services 
an opportunity unique to our business model is that it includes an integrated strategy in which the services group provides construction and operation and maintenance services to our utility group 
this provides us with economies of scale 
we also continue to pursue acquisitions of small  strategic service companies that expand our geographic presence and give us knowledge of the regions water and wastewater needs 
this local knowledge positions us for growth both in the service as well as the utility side of the business as municipalities look to form public private partnerships or to sell their utility assets 
this was demonstrated in march by our acquisition of novus utilities  a contract operations business in alabama which gave us local knowledge and relationships in the region 
this positioning in turn led to the acquisition of three wastewater utilities  one in september  a second in november and the third in january results of operations change in presentation effective january   we elected to allocate a portion of the services group s operating expense overhead between affiliated and unaffiliated customers for segment reporting purposes 
in prior periods  all operating expense overhead was reflected as operating expenses attributable to unaffiliated customers 
this change in allocation methodology increased the gross profit from sales to unaffiliated customers and decreased the gross profit from sales to affiliated customers by the same amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  we do not eliminate the intersegment profit recognized on sales to affiliated customers because we believe the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future utility group revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we do  however  eliminate the services group s revenues from affiliated customers to the extent of its cost 
consequently  this change resulted in a decrease in the services group s revenues and direct operating expenses reported in and by the same amounts 
consolidated gross profit  operating income and net income are unchanged 
in  we centralized many of our common business functions into a shared services departmental structure and the related expenses were classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
effective january  we concluded that these expenses were more operational in nature and elected to classify these expenses as direct operating expenses 
as a result  amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million for year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
by segment  revenues changed as follows increase percent of revenues in thousands  except percentages decrease utility group services group total utility group 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period during the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the following a million increase at our california utility related to increased consumption and an increase in rates that went into effect on july   and a million increase primarily resulting from a fourth quarter rate increase at one of our texas utilities  a fourth quarter rate increase at one of our other texas utilities  a rate increase at our alabama wastewater treatment facility and an increase in customer connections at our texas and new mexico utilities  and a million increase resulting from utility acquisitions in san antonio  texas and northern mississippi  offset by a million decrease due to lower consumption attributable to the wet weather in the texas region during the year 
services group 
revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the following increase percent of revenues in thousands  except percentages decrease revenues from unaffiliated customers intersegment revenues total revenues intersegment cost eliminations total revenues from unaffiliated customers decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the following a million decrease in contract operations  maintenance  public works and construction work in our southeast region due to contracts not renewed or canceled  and a million decrease related to lower revenues in texas from new housing construction due to a slowdown in housing starts as well as inclement weather compared to the prior year  offset by a million increase related to increased business activity combined with our ongoing efforts to review our contracts and increase prices 
intersegment revenues from our utility group decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
the decrease in revenues resulted from a decrease in construction projects performed for our new mexico and texas utilities due to a slow down in housing construction as well as a reduction in capital expenditures by our texas utilities 
direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year as follows increase percent of revenues in thousands  except percentages decrease utility group services group total utility group and services group direct operating expenses are computed as a percent of their respective revenues 
total direct operating expenses are computed as a percentage of total revenues 
utility group 
direct operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period during the prior year 
the increase in direct operating expenses was primarily due to the following a million increase in expenses resulting from our san antonio  texas and northern mississippi utility acquisitions  and increases at our texas and new mexico utilities in depreciation expense  contract operation fees  and sewage treatment expenses  a million net increase in direct operating expenses at our california utility principally resulting from higher water usage related to increased consumption and higher depreciation rates adopted under the rate case that went into effect on july   and a million increase resulting from the one time recognition of a balancing account receivable in by our california utility pursuant to a cpuc decision which was recognized as a reduction of operating expenses 
direct operating expenses were and of related revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the recognition of a balancing account receivable in as mentioned above

direct operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
the decrease in direct operating expenses was due to the following a million decrease related to contracts not renewed or canceled in our southeast region net of cost increases to correct past performance issues in that region  and a million decrease primarily related to lower revenues from new housing construction related work compared to the prior year due to inclement weather and a slowdown in the housing market in texas  partially offset by a million increase in direct costs associated with increased business activity  and a million charge in in anticipation of a settlement for our share of potential fines and penalties imposed by a water quality control board

services group gross profit on revenues from our utility group decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period during the prior year 
the decrease is related to a slow down in housing construction  wet weather in texas  as well as a reduction in capital expenditures by our texas utilities 
the services group supports three distinctly different customer bases  texas municipal utility districts or mud s  municipal clients through operations and maintenance contracts  and southwest water s own utility group 
we need to accelerate our performance improvements and therefore we refocused this group in early along these business lines to better serve the unique demands of each customer base  to focus our business development efforts for each market and to eliminate structural redundancies that may exist today

the utility group increase is caused primarily by legal costs incurred in connection with the condemnation proceedings against our new mexico utility 
in accordance with new mexico statute  costs incurred aggregating million through december  are expected to be reimbursed to us by the parties seeking condemnation should we prevail in the action 
the services group expense increase resulted primarily from a restructuring charge associated with the workforce realignment 
corporate expenses increased as result of million of costs incurred related to our cornerstone project which commenced in the second quarter of and higher salary  wages and related benefits attributable to upgrades in management and staff positions  partially offset by million of ceo relocation expenses incurred in the cornerstone project is a company wide initiative to reengineer our business processes and integrate our information systems onto a single platform across the entire company utilizing state of the art systems and technology 
our existing systems are standalone legacy systems that were in place when we acquired many of our companies 
these individual standalone systems are costly to operate and maintain and make the consolidation and sharing of data between the various platforms labor intensive and time consuming 
the financial module of the integrated platform became operational on january  and is performing as expected 
we are investing in this new technology to enable us to gather and disseminate information on a more timely basis at reduced costs thereby improving customer service and enhancing operational efficiencies 
although expenditures related to the information technology hardware and software portions of this initiative are capitalized  certain costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect to recover a portion of our cornerstone investment through the rates of our owned utility portfolio due to the customer service enhancements and we also believe the rest of the investment will result in cost savings in the services group  resulting in improved margins 
impairment of goodwill 
during  charges totaling million were recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
as required by sfas  we test goodwill annually for impairment at the reporting unit level  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realization of long lived assets  including goodwill  is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
forecasted revenues and capital expenditures  which include forecasted customer connection growth and the timing and amount of regulated rate increases  are key components of the discounted cash flow projections 
during recent impairment testing  we determined that revenue growth for our texas utilities was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction as well as a slower rate of regulated rate increases 
additionally we determined that higher levels of capital expenditures than previously projected were necessary to bring the systems into regulatory compliance and to continue improving the quality of service for our customers 
these factors resulted in significantly lower discounted cash flow projections than previously forecast 
based on these projections  the entire million of goodwill associated with the texas utilities was found to be impaired and was charged to expense in other income expense

we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for reporting units with goodwill balances 
the realization of the company s long lived assets  including goodwill  is dependent on expected future cash flows from the underlying operations 
during the second quarter of  we reviewed the business strategy for our water and wastewater testing laboratory reporting unit 
this review resulted in our decision to realign the operations by reducing the size and scope of its business activities and focusing on its core operations and customers 
this realignment is intended to create a strong foundation for providing high quality laboratory testing and reporting services to municipal utility districts and targeted commercial customers  enhancing future growth and performance 
the carrying value of the entity was tested for impairment using the revised cash flow projections and it was determined that carrying values were not fully recoverable

effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r required us to change from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered

 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires companies to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an examination by the taxing authority 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant taxing authority 
as of january   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions were not significant and therefore adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements

our services group provides construction  operations and maintenance services to our utilities in alabama  mississippi  new mexico and texas and recognizes a profit on those services 
in accordance with sfas  we do not eliminate the services group s profit recognized on these services because management believes the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future utility group revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we do  however  eliminate revenues to the extent of the related costs in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the guidance provided in sfas since the regulators that govern our utilities have historically approved the services provided and rates charged by our services group to our utilities as a component of rates  we believe we have met the requirements of sfas to recognize profit on such services 
during the years ended december   and  we have recognized profit of million  million and million  respectively 
over the years  the cpuc  the regulator of suburban  our california utility  has had various policies with respect to accounting for the difference between suburban s actual water production costs incurred and cpuc adopted water production costs 
in the water industry  those costs consist of expenditures for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes 
at times  the cpuc has allowed balancing accounts in the financial statements of water utilities whereby the difference between actual and cpuc adopted costs are recorded as either a receivable  for under collections of costs from customers  or as a liability  for over collections of costs from customers  as permitted by sfas under these procedures  the utility would apply for the dispensation of balancing accounts and amounts would either be refunded to or recovered from utility customers through future cpuc authorized rate adjustments  once certain balancing thresholds were achieved 
prior to november   the cpuc allowed the recording of the difference between actual costs incurred and the cpuc adopted volume related costs to balancing accounts 
the cpuc changed their methodology in and required an earnings test to accompany annual submissions of memorandum accounts where these volume related differences would be tracked 
once submitted to the cpuc  the utility would subsequently be directed by the cpuc as to what portion of their memorandum account could be added to or subtracted from its balancing account 
as a result of this change and the uncertainties the earnings test created with respect to the collections of under collections  suburban elected to record in its financial statements only over collections of volume related costs until recovery of under collections was assured 
suburban followed this practice from december until april in april  the cpuc issued a decision which eliminated the required earnings test  removing the uncertainty associated with the recovering balancing account under collections 
as a result  in we recorded million of receivables related to balancing account under collections attributable to and million and million attributable to and  respectively 
in october  the cpuc issued a ruling that our california utility could collect the net amount of its balancing accounts from through over a one year period 
future cpuc policy changes could have an impact on recording under collections in future periods 
revenue recognition water utility revenues are recognized when water is delivered to customers 
at the end of an accounting period  estimated amounts for unbilled revenues are accrued for water usage since the previous billing period 
revenues for contract operations are recognized and billed at the end of the month based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects for unaffiliated third parties are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and income as work progresses on a project based on the expected total project costs and the expected total project revenues 
we estimate the percentage of completion using total contract price  actual costs incurred to date and an estimate of the completion costs for each contract 
revenues for construction projects for utilities within our utility group are recorded using the completed contract method of accounting under which all revenues and costs are recognized upon completion of the project 
if management anticipates we will ultimately suffer a loss on a construction project  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period such a determination is made 
for contracts involving the provision of a single product or service single element contracts  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable 
if services are provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
for contracts involving the provision of multiple products or services elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each service in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
certain non refundable activation fees in our non regulated wholesale water operations are recognized over the expected period of performance 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we assess intangible assets and other long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method in accordance with sfas for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million charge to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets held for sale to estimated realizable value in accordance with sfas net long lived assets and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to million as of december  goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  on october st of each year  or when events or circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for all of our reporting units with goodwill balances  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets 
forecasted revenues and capital expenditures  which include forecasted customer connection growth and the timing and amount of regulated rate increases  are key components of the discounted cash flow projections 
during recent impairment testing  we determined that revenue growth for our texas utilities was likely to be slower than originally projected due to downturns in overall economic conditions and new housing construction as well as a slower rate of regulated rate increases 
additionally we determined that higher levels of capital expenditures than previously projected were necessary to bring the systems into regulatory compliance and to continue improving the quality of service for our customers 
these factors resulted in significantly lower discounted cash flow projections than previously forecast 
based on these projections  the entire million of goodwill associated with our texas utilities was found to be impaired and was charged to expense in goodwill with an aggregate book value of million remains as of december   million of which pertains to our services group and million pertains to our utilities group 
this goodwill will be subject to impairment testing on october   or sooner  if additional events occur or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible further impairment may have occurred 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide an exact measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  using the black scholes option valuation model

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had million of long term variable and fixed rate debt 
we are exposed to market risk based on changes in prevailing interest rates 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
we have million of long term debt that bears interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate or libor rate 
our variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical one percent basis points increase in the average interest rates charged on our variable rate debt would reduce our pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
our fixed rate debt  which has a carrying value of million  has a fair value of million as of december  market risk related to our fixed rate debt is deemed to be the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in prevailing interest rates 
our fixed rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates  from to  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce these risks although we may do so in the future 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
