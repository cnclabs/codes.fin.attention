item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary business of the company is the ownership of the bank 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company also generates noninterest income such as income from real estate development activities and service fees 
noninterest expense consists of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company intends such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended  and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the company  are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar expressions 
the company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  the economic health of the local real estate market  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory provisions  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan and securities portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the company s market area  and accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
average statement of financial condition the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average statement of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years ended december    and the yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from average month end balances 
management does not believe that the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
average balances of loans receivable include loans on which the bank has discontinued accruing interest 
loan yields include fees which are considered adjustments to yields

amount is net of deferred loan origination fees  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts  and allowance for loan losses and includes non performing loans 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the years indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

securities available for sale decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in securities available for sale was due to repayments and calls on securities

these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in premises and equipment  the result of the bank s proposed new branch location on th street in chicago  illinois 
total liabilities at december  were million compared to million at december  deposits decreased million to million at december  from december   this decrease was the result of competition and the bank managing its interest rate risk 
advances from the federal home loan bank and other borrowings decreased million and  respectively at december  from the same period in as less liquidity was required throughout the year 
stockholders equity at december  was million  which is equivalent to of total assets

provision for loan losses management establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  at a level management believes is appropriate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information  and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision  as more information becomes available or as future events change 
the provision for loan losses was  and  in and  respectively 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses as of december  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank maintains a liquidity ratio substantially above the regulatory requirement 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average regulatory liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities 
net cash from operating activities were million   and million in   and  respectively 
net cash from investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities  offset by principal collections on loans  proceeds from maturing securities and paydowns on mortgage backed securities 
net cash from investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts  fhlb borrowings  and securities sold under repurchase agreements in addition to the purchase of treasury stock 
the net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tier core capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the bank has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank may also utilize fhlb advances or the sale of securities available for sale as a source of funds 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans  both of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some quantitative  while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
management is monitoring credit risk trends and the impact on the allowance for loan losses analysis 
real estate owned real estate acquired through foreclosure and similar proceedings is carried at cost fair value at the date of foreclosure or at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
losses on disposition  including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition  are charged to operations 
operating costs after acquisition are expensed 
real estate values are declining in the company s market and management is monitoring the values of its real estate owned properties 
commitments at december   the bank had outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans of  as compared to  in the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan origination commitments 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from december  totaled million 
management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be renewed at the bank 
however  if these deposits are not retained  the bank may utilize fhlb advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new funds  which may result in higher levels of interest expense 
the following tables disclose contractual obligations and commitments of the company as of december  total less than year years years after years securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb advances total contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit loans in process unused lines of credit loan commitments total commitments impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purposes of the risk based capital requirement 
as of december   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would be expected to have a negative impact on the bank s operating results 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors quarterly 
the following tables show the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december  and assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of  and  basis points

the bank and the company do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments in a material amount to control interest rate risk 
in addition  interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank and the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
