item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights sales increased in fiscal over the prior year 
product costs increased an estimated during fiscal over the prior year 
operating income increased to  and of sales  a increase over the prior year 
net earnings and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
fiscal provided a challenging economic environment 
our industry is experiencing various macro economic pressures  including high fuel costs  rising food prices and general economic conditions which are pressuring consumer disposable income 
these factors restricted growth in fiscal and are continuing into fiscal high food cost inflation  which we began to experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal  prevailed throughout fiscal in spite of these conditions  our operating companies managed margins and expenses effectively 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal  while operating expenses grew only over the prior year 
operating income was negatively impacted by additional expenses from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values as compared to gains in fiscal and increased provisions related to multi employer pension plans 
the negative impact of these additional expenses was partially offset by lower share based compensation expense and lower company sponsored pension expenses 
in addition  fuel costs increased in fiscal  driven by higher fuel prices 
we partially offset the impact of the higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures as well as fuel surcharges 
we expect fuel costs in fiscal to be greater than in fiscal overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  hotel supply operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 
we estimate that we serve about of an approximately billion annual market 
this market includes i the foodservice market in the united states and canada and ii the hotel amenity and hotel furniture and textile market in the united states  canada  europe and asia 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food prepared away from home  market represents approximately one half of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level 
this share grew from about in to about in and has not changed materially since that time 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 
we intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth  margin management  productivity gains and supply chain management 
strategic business initiatives sysco maintains strategic focus areas which aim to help us achieve our long term vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient  multi temperature food product value chain 
the following areas generally comprise the initiatives that are currently serving as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future 
sourcing and national supply chain focuses on lowering our cost of goods sold by leveraging sysco s purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our supply chain 
our national supply chain initiative is focused on lowering inventory  inbound freight  product costs  operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
integrated delivery focuses on standardized processes to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers 
demand explores and implements practices to better understand and more profitably sell to and service sysco s customers  including better tools and processes for selling 
organizational capabilities works to align management reporting  information technology systems and performance measures with the business initiatives 
a major component of our national supply chain is the use of redistribution centers rdcs 
the first rdc  the northeast rdc located in front royal  virginia  opened during the third quarter of fiscal construction of our second rdc in alachua  florida was completed in fiscal  and 
table of contents operations to service our five broadline operating companies in florida began in april in fiscal  we intend to service additional broadline companies from our existing rdcs 
we will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy  handle and market products for our customers 
our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america  however we will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities 
as a part of our on going strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 
accounting changes fin adoption as of july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the application of sfas by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
as a result of this adoption  we recognized  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  a  decrease in our beginning retained earnings on our july  balance sheet 
pension measurement date change and sfas adoption as of june   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
the recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plan s funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plan s funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of june  was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of  a decrease in other assets of  an increase in accrued expenses of  a decrease in long term deferred taxes of  an increase in other long term liabilities of  and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of  the adoption of sfas s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  the adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for any period presented  and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 
sfas also has a measurement date provision  which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position  effective for fiscal years ending after december  in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed the measurement date for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal year end to may st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates 
as a result of this change  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
with the issuance of sfas  we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time 
as a result  beginning with fiscal  the measurement date again corresponded with our fiscal year end 
we performed measurements as of may  and june  of our plan assets and benefit obligations 
we recorded a charge to beginning retained earnings on july  of  net of tax  for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates 
we also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income loss on july  of  net of tax  for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates 
eitf adoption in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting pronouncement eitf accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  eitf 
the accounting standard requires certain transactions  where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined  to be presented in the income statement on a net basis 
this situation primarily arises for sysco when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced  but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations 
the application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard 
we adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively 
prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated 
therefore  the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins  operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the non comparable periods is affected 
the impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  and  for the first weeks of fiscal  without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods 
beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period

table of contents sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal the impact of eitf reduced sales growth by  or  for fiscal  compared to a  reduction for fiscal sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of eitf product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices was a significant contributor to sales growth in fiscal and to a lesser extent in fiscal estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were approximately during fiscal  as compared to during fiscal the rate of sales growth declined throughout fiscal from in the first quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe the current general economic conditions  which are placing pressure on consumer disposable income  are contributing to a decline in real volume growth in the foodservice market and in turn  have contributed to a slow down in our sales growth 
to the extent that these conditions persist  we believe that sales growth in fiscal will be lower than what was achieved in fiscal we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities  investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthen customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers 
operating income cost of sales primarily includes product costs  net of vendor consideration  as well as in bound freight 
operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
operating income increased in fiscal over fiscal  increasing to of sales 
gross margin dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal operating income increased in fiscal over fiscal  increasing to of sales 
gross margin dollars increased in fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sysco began experiencing product cost increases in numerous product categories 
these increases have persisted throughout fiscal at levels approximating 
generally  sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers  however  because of contractual and competitive reasons  we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately 
sysco s goal is to obtain the lowest total procurement cost for our customers 
we believe that we have managed the inflationary environment well  as evidenced by gross margin dollars increasing in both fiscal and at rates greater than expense increases 
the high rate of product cost inflation has continued into fiscal we believe that prolonged periods of high inflation  such as the current rate  have a negative impact on our customers as rising food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the food prepared away from home market 
as a result  these factors may negatively impact our sales  gross margins and earnings 
fiscal operating expenses were negatively impacted by a net  in additional expenses as compared to fiscal from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multi employer pension plans  partially offset by lower share based compensation expense and lower company sponsored pension expenses 
in addition  fuel costs increased during fiscal we increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs  thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income 
in fiscal  the positive impact on operating expenses from decreases in company sponsored pension expenses  share based compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies  was largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives 
the carrying value of our corporate owned life insurance policies is adjusted to their cash surrender values 
this resulted in a loss of  in fiscal  a gain of  in fiscal and a gain of  in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a provision of  related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multi employer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision of  related to our withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations 
share based compensation cost in fiscal was  less than fiscal share based compensation expense decreased  in fiscal over fiscal these decreases were primarily due to lower levels of stock option grants in recent years as compared to previous years 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were  less than fiscal  due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the qualified pension plan 
net company sponsored pension costs decreased  in fiscal over the prior year  due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal pension costs 

table of contents also affecting the comparison of fiscal and fiscal were increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives 
due primarily to improved operating results  the non stock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers 
investments in strategic business initiatives increased  in fiscal over the prior year 
in addition  sysco s fuel costs increased by  in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased diesel prices 
our fuel costs increased by  in fiscal over fiscal due to increased diesel prices and increased volume usage 
sysco s costs per gallon have increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal during fiscal  and  fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
sysco s activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds  entering into forward fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges 
we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in july and august  we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately  through july  which will lock in the price on approximately of our fuel purchases through the first weeks of fiscal and approximately of our fuel purchases needs for the last weeks of fiscal in fiscal  due to sustained  increased diesel prices  sysco increased its use of fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately  higher in fiscal than in fiscal the change in fuel surcharges in fiscal over fiscal was not significant 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins 
if fuel prices continue at current levels  fuel costs in the first weeks of fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately  to  as compared to the first weeks of fiscal our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid august  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset this increase in fuel expense in fiscal  including the continued use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
if fuel surcharges continue in fiscal at the same levels as the end of fiscal  we estimate that we can recover about half of the anticipated increase in fuel costs noted above through increased fuel surcharges  which is less than the approximate we were able to recover in fiscal customer accounts written off  net of recoveries  were  or of sales   or of sales  and  or of sales  for fiscal  and  respectively 
we continue to monitor our customer account balances and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in write offs in fiscal however  if the challenging economic environment persists  we could experience increased levels of write offs and a higher provision for losses on receivables in fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal are expected to increase by approximately  due primarily to lower returns on assets of the qualified pension plan during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in expense due to amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan 
share based compensation expense in fiscal is expected to decrease  to  the expected decrease is due primarily to two factors 
first  option grants in prior years were at greater levels than recent years  resulting in reduced compensation expense being recognized 
secondly  the management incentive plan annual bonus awards have been modified beginning with fiscal  to exclude the previous stock award component 
as a result  the share based compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years will not be incurred in fiscal  and as a result fiscal will reflect reduced overall share based based compensation expenses 
beginning in fiscal  we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary restricted stock grants subject to time based vesting which may result in increased share based compensation expense in fiscal net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal over fiscal net earnings increased in fiscal over fiscal the changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above  as well as the impact of changes in interest expense  other income and income taxes discussed below 
additionally  fiscal over fiscal was impacted by a fiscal accounting change 
in the first quarter of fiscal  sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits plans  which increased net earnings for fiscal by  net of tax 
the increase in interest expense of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased borrowing levels partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt 
the decrease in interest expense of  in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels 
other income  net increased  in fiscal over fiscal and  in fiscal over fiscal changes between the years resulted from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to gains from the sale of land and facilities as well as the sale of a minority interest in a business 
the increase in fiscal over the prior year is primarily due to a gain on the sale of land 

table of contents the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately  resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change   related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and  related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions  share based compensation expense and the recognition of losses to adjust the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to lower share based compensation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance policies 
earnings per share basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these increases were primarily the result of factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases 
the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and  with regard to fiscal  an increase in the number of anti dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 
segment results we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments  of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments 
these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 
prior to fiscal  sysco s management evaluated performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective earnings before income taxes 
this measure included an allocation of certain corporate expenses to each operating segment in addition to the centrally incurred costs for shared services that were charged to our segments 
during fiscal  sysco s management increased its focus on the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which excludes the allocation of additional corporate expenses 
as a result  the segment reporting for fiscal and has been revised to conform to the fiscal presentation 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins  expenses  or a combination thereof  each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth

broadline segment broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represent approximately of sysco s overall sales and greater than of sysco s overall operating income prior to corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment s earnings 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal non comparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal fiscal growth was realized both from increased sales to multi unit customers and marketing associate served customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and efforts of our marketing associates 
product cost inflation and the resulting increases in selling prices was the primary contributor to sales growth 
sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the impact of eitf reduced sales growth by  or  for fiscal compared to a  reduction for fiscal sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of eitf non comparable acquisitions did not have an impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal fiscal growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associate served customers and multi unit customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers  increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates 
operating income the increases in operating income in fiscal over fiscal were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses 
we were able to manage our business effectively in the current inflationary environment by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies 
gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal the high cost of fuel also impacted our results 
fuel costs in fiscal were  higher than fiscal we attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven  improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds  entering into fixed price fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges 
in fiscal  due to sustained increased diesel prices  our use of fuel surcharges increased 
fuel surcharges were approximately  higher in fiscal over fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a provision of  related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multi employer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision of  related to our withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan 
the increases in operating income in fiscal over fiscal were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses 
gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal 
table of contents sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal fiscal growth was generally due to product cost increases and sales to new customers 
these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to non renewed customer agreements and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma s customer base 
sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the impact of eitf reduced sales growth by  or  for fiscal compared to a  reduction for fiscal sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is the one year anniversary of the adoption of eitf non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal the remaining fiscal growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma s existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers 
in addition  certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations  contributing to the sales increase 
operating income operating income in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal in fiscal  sygma expensed  related to the write off of software development costs 
in addition  some of sygma s customers have experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop 
sygma also experienced increased fuel costs of  although it was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers including fuel surcharges and reducing expenses 
fuel surcharges were approximately  higher in fiscal over fiscal expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices  reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts 
the increase in operating income in fiscal was due to several factors  including sales growth  increased margins and improved operating efficiencies  partially offset by costs of labor increases and auto liability related expenses 
in addition  the transfer of customers from broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in operating income 
other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce  custom cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under sfas no 
on an aggregate basis  our other segments have a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry 
these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately and of sysco s overall sales and operating income in fiscal  respectively 
operating income increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the custom cut meat segment 
operating income increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase in operating income was generated by improved results in each of the other segments and acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada 
we intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
we also strive to increase the effectiveness of our operations through the use of technology and our supply chain and other strategic initiatives 
these objectives require continuing investment 
our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet and other equipment  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt 
our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization 
historically  our long term debt to total capitalization ratio has generally been in the 
table of contents range of and 
this ratio was and as of june  and june   respectively 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  long term debt includes both the current maturities and long term portion 
we continue to assess and review the most appropriate capital structure as well as the appropriate leverage ratios with which to measure that capital structure 
as a part of our on going strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
these transactions may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future  including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 
operating activities we generated  in cash flow from operations in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to net income in these years  reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth 
the accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in accrued expenses of  during fiscal  and was positively impacted by increases in accrued expenses of  during fiscal and  during fiscal the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below 
this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixed rate debt issued in fiscal and an increase to a provision related to a multi employer pension plan 
see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations 
the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was related to various miscellaneous accruals 
in fiscal  we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of  and the corresponding insurance receivable of  included within prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in fiscal  these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible 
see further discussion of the product liability claim under note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  increased  during fiscal  decreased  in fiscal and increased  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred compensation from incentive compensation deferrals of prior year annual incentive bonuses and the accrual of interest on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
these increases were partially offset by the recording of net company sponsored pension costs and the timing of pension contributions to our company sponsored plans 
in fiscal and  the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net company sponsored pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our company sponsored plans 
in fiscal  our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow 
in fiscal  the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow 
we recorded net company sponsored pension costs of   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit plans were   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect to contribute approximately  to our company sponsored defined benefit plans in fiscal investing activities fiscal capital expenditures included construction of fold out facilities in knoxville  tennessee and longview  texas  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in atlanta  georgia  chicago  illinois  peterborough  ontario and houston  texas  completion of the southeast rdc in alachua  florida  and completion of work on the corporate headquarters expansion

there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of june  or august  fixed rate debt in july  we repaid the senior notes totaling  at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in september  we issued senior notes totaling  due on september   under the april shelf registration 
these notes  which were priced at of par  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption 
proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of september in september  in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes described above  we settled a  notional amount forward starting interest rate swap we had entered into in march upon termination  we paid cash of  which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination 
this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the year term of the debt  and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss  net of tax  in other comprehensive income loss 
in may  we repaid at maturity the senior notes totaling  utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in april  we repaid at maturity the senior notes totaling  utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

table of contents in january  the sec granted our request to terminate our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in april for the issuance of debt securities 
in february  we filed an automatically effective well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to  in debt securities with the sec

certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders  including provisions to maintain our long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of june  other as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
as of june  and june   letters of credit outstanding were  and  respectively 
other considerations multi employer pension plans as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
based on the information available from plan administrators  we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi employer plans we participate in  some of which appear to be underfunded  could be as much as  based on a voluntary withdrawal 
required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  the pension protection act  enacted in august  requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
of the plans in which sysco participates  one plan is more critically underfunded than the others 
during fiscal  we obtained information that this plan failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and believe it is probable that additional funding will be required as well as the payment of excise tax 
as a result  we recorded a liability of approximately  related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods 
currently  we believe that a majority of this amount will be paid in fiscal and are continuing to explore our alternatives as it relates to this plan 
as of june   we have approximately  in liabilities recorded in total related to certain underfunded multi employer defined benefit plans 
bscc cooperative structure our affiliate  bscc  is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code 
we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws 
however  if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal  state or local tax authority  we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise have deferred until future periods 
in that event  we would be liable for interest on such amounts 
as of june   sysco has recorded deferred income tax liabilities of  net of federal benefit  related to the bscc supply chain distributions 
if the irs and any other relevant taxing authorities determine that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred  and the determination is upheld  we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred  as discussed above  we may be required to pay interest on the cumulative deferred balances 
these interest amounts could range from  to  prior to federal and state income tax benefit  as of june  sysco calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions interest rates in effect in each period 
the irs  in connection with its audit of our and federal income tax returns  proposed adjustments related to the taxability of the cooperative structure 
we are vigorously protesting these adjustments 
we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs  and while management believes it is probable we will prevail  we concluded the measurement model of fin required us to provide an accrual for a portion of the interest exposure 
if a taxing authority requires us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest  
table of contents if any  we may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or we may have to forego share repurchases or defer planned capital expenditures or a combination of these items 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans multi employer pension plans unrecognized tax benefits including interest unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to debt long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under fin  which we adopted as of july  as of june   we had a liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and  for related interest that could result in cash payment 
as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
for further discussion of the impact of adopting fin  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed  including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june  included  in cash 
this amount is not included in the table above 
no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of june   we do not have a minimum funding requirement under erisa guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions 
however  we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling  during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
table of contents receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  accounting for business combinations and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated  the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated  a increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by  while a decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by  the impact of a increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a decrease in discount rates because a decrease in discount rates would require additional amounts of amortization from net actuarial losses which would not be required with a increase in this rate 
as of june   our net actuarial losses from our company sponsored pension plans were  an increase of  we estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal pension expense by approximately  as compared to fiscal we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of june  and june  as of june   the serp assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal depending upon the participant s position with the company and a salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal and thereafter 
as of june   the serp assumed salary rate increases of through fiscal and thereafter 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and for fiscal the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately  
table of contents the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas as of june  resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june  after adoption of sfas was a charge  net of tax  of  which represented the net actuarial losses  prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of sfas as of that date 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of  changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  decreased net company sponsored pension costs by  in fiscal and are expected to increase net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by approximately  however  a change in the serp design is expected to decrease net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by  for a net increase of approximately  we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  as in the previous years  contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of  which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other post retirement plans together are approximately income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
prior to fiscal  in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  we established an accrual when  despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable  we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable 
when facts and circumstances changed  these accruals were adjusted 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted fin  which changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
see discussion under note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
in certain of these latter instances  the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco 
in these cases  we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill 
table of contents impairment are our six operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units 
we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated average sales and earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry  average sales and earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
our past estimates of fair value for fiscal  and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in fiscal  the reporting units fair values would have had to have been lower by compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units 
the other specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products and international distribution operations operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma segments 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline segment 
as such  these other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal and later years includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted through july   but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for periods prior to fiscal have not been restated 
as of june   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a discount for post vesting restrictions 
the discount for post vesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

table of contents in addition  certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july   we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
new accounting standards sfas in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we have decided not to adopt sfas for our existing financial assets and liabilities at the date of option 
thus  there will be no one time impact from adoption of this standard to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination 
this statement also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we will apply this statement primarily on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal earlier application of the standard is prohibited 
fsp in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a common definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which partially defers the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
consequently  sfas will be effective for sysco in fiscal for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
as a result of the deferral  sfas will be effective in fiscal for non recurring  non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
we believe the adoption of sfas in fiscal for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas in fiscal for non recurring  non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 
sfas in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting 
this statement will be effective for sysco s financial statements beginning with the third quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas may have on its financial statement disclosures 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings  the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business  expense trends  anticipated multi employer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multi employer pension plans  the outcome of ongoing tax audits  the impact of ongoing legal proceedings  the loss of sysco s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole  compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  long term debt to capitalization ratios  anticipated capital expenditures and the sources of financing for those capital expenditures  continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic business initiatives  anticipated company sponsored pension 
table of contents plan liabilities  the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities  the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements  predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses  the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a above and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic business initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
the ability to meet long term debt to capitalization ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent  and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect  our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect  as well 
the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions

table of contents in the following table as of june   commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as long term based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our us and canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a long term basis

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within shareholders equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars 
our canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars  which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 
fuel price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco increased by approximately  in fiscal over fiscal and  in fiscal over fiscal from time to time  we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of june   we had no outstanding forward diesel fuel purchase commitments 
in july and august  we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately  through july  which will lock in the price on approximately of our fuel purchases through the first weeks of fiscal and approximately of our fuel purchases needs for the last weeks of fiscal if fuel prices continue at current levels  fuel costs in the first weeks of fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately  to  as compared to the first weeks of fiscal our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel mid august  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable or favorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to  to
