item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
note to the financial statements contains segment information 
overview results of operations during the first three quarters of  the company managed and reported through two business segments engineering and systems 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the past and anticipated growth in certain areas of our business and change in leadership during  we reevaluated our reportable segments under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
as a result  we have elected to realign both management and reporting into four business segments engineering  construction  automation and land 
the engineering segment provides consulting services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services 
services provided by the engineering segment include feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement  and construction management 
the construction segment provides construction management personnel and services in the areas of inspection  mechanical integrity  vendor and turnaround surveillance  field support  construction  quality assurance and plant asset management 
the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication  and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  and information technology projects 
the land segment provides land management  right of way  and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to the pipeline  utility and telecom companies and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states and canada 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  procurement and construction service revenue and engineered systems sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through cost plus contracts whereas a majority of the company s engineered system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials  and equipment and may provide construction services on a direct hire or subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing costs  as well as costs related to the executive  governance investor relations  finance  accounting  safety  human resources  project controls and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects 
corporate sg a expense may vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives

of these expenses  million relates to the management incentive plan 
since the company experienced losses in  we incurred no management incentive plan expense during that year 
the remainder is attributable to a general increase in corporate overhead positions to support company growth 
there was also an increase in professional services for items such as sarbanes oxley sox compliance and audits totaling million and an increase of amortization and depreciation expense of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
as a percent of revenue  corporate sg a decreased from in to in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in of the million increase  million is attributable to stock compensation expense and million is attributable to professional services 
the company did not record stock compensation expense during  as the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  see note 
professional services included increases for sox compliance and audits 
also  salaries and employee related expenses increased million as a result of the addition of corporate overhead positions in the business development  accounting  and it departments 
facilities and office expenses increased million 
as a percent of revenue  sg a increased from in to in operating profit operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  increasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in this increase was primarily the result of the company s performance in on two fixed price contracts that did not recur in however  the operating profit of was reduced by a million charge taken in relation to the sle project 
operating profit decreased million to million in as compared to million in  decreasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in other income expense other income decreased from  in to  in other income was  in other income in was derived mainly from the sale of the building in baton rouge offset by a loss on the sale of assets for the closing of our dallas office 
other income in was primarily derived from insurance proceeds received by pei investments relating to our hurricane rita losses 
pei s portion  prior to the may  purchase of two thirds of the partnership interest by ecs  was  from that time to december   almost  more in insurance was received 
this is offset by approximately  in government penalties and the remainder in the write off of software licenses

refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
capital spending in the pipeline area is also trending higher  with numerous projects in north america currently underway to deliver crude oil  natural gas  petrochemicals and refined products 
renewable energy appears to be an emerging area of activity and potential growth  with the company currently performing a variety of services for ethanol  biodiesel  coal to liquids  petroleum coke to ammonia  and other biomass processes 
the engineering segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
our detail design services proved strong with revenues increasing  or million  from million in to million in in  these services increased  or million  from million in as a percent of total engineering revenue  detail design revenue increased to in from in and increased in from in our field services revenues remained relatively stable with an increase of  or million  from million in to million in in  field services revenue increased  or million  from million in this was due to an increased demand from our existing customers for in plant resources 
as a percent of total engineering revenue  field services revenue increased to in from in and increased in from in revenue from procurement services decreased  or million  from million in to million in in  these services decreased  or million  from million in this significant decrease is primarily related to three projects  two of which began in and one of which began in and all of which were materially completed in as a percent of total engineering revenue  procurement services revenue decreased to in from in and decreased a significant from in the level of procurement services varies over time depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services 
fixed price revenues decreased  or million  from million in to million in there was an increase in of  or million  from million in as a percent of total engineering revenue  fixed price revenue decreased to in from in  but in it increased from in in  the company was awarded two significant fixed price engineering  procurement and construction epc projects in the refining industry that included procurement and subcontractor activities within our scope of work 
this accounts for the higher level of procurement revenue in that year 
together  these two fixed price epc projects accounted for approximately million of the engineering segment revenues during  compared to approximately million during the current combined contract value of these two projects is approximately million and both have been completed 
as a result of revised estimates of the percentage of completion of these projects  the company suffered reversals of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of due to losses incurred in connection with these contracts  we anticipate entering into this type of contract in the future only on a very limited basis 
gross profit our engineering segment s total gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of total gross profit  the engineering segment s gross profit increased from to during the same period 
due to losses on two epc fixed price contracts in our engineering segment  as discussed above  total gross profit in decreased million  or  from million in the increase in was primarily due to the lack of similar loss activities in while the two epc contracts did contribute approximately million to revenue  increasing revenues for  the cost and loss recognition for the same time period was million 
the net result was a negative impact of approximately million to gross profit 
both of the significant fixed price epc projects were completed in in  the company shifted a portion of its services to developer type work for customers that are typically smaller than its historical customer base  including sle 
the viability of these projects and the creditworthiness of these types of customers must be carefully analyzed to assure profitable results 
in the future  the company intends to analyze these projects on a more comprehensive basis before accepting them 
the company has also engaged in a number of entrepreneurial ventures over the past several years  not all of which have been profitable 
in the future  the company intends to scrutinize these projects much more carefully before engaging in them and exit them more quickly if they are not successful 
during  one of those ventures was discontinued in march with the closing of our dallas office as the location did not provide the intended benefits 
we earn a lower margin on procurement services than we earn on our core engineering services 
for example  procurement services for produced a gross profit margin  whereas core engineering services produced a gross profit margin of 
if the company s business shifts away from predominantly engineering projects to epc projects which include material procurement and construction responsibility  engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue will be negatively impacted 
this shift would precipitate lower gross profit because higher cost plus margins on engineering labor  recognized during the period in which it was earned  would now be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the duration of the projects 
operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses our engineering segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  the engineering segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  sg a increased from in to in  and it increased in from in the engineering segment s sg a expenses increased million in over as a result of increases for bad debt expense 
of this increase  was related to creation of the reserve against the sle notes receivable  while the remainder comprised general increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
to offset these increases  facilities and office expenses decreased by million due to the closing of the dallas office in march also  salaries and employee expenses decreased by million as a result of the reclassification of some employees from overhead to direct expense positions 
additional savings were recognized in stock compensation expense and professional services 
the engineering segment s sg a expenses increased million in over  primarily as a result of increases of million in facilities and office expense 
these increases resulted from expansions in the tulsa  houston and beaumont offices to meet both current and projected growth requirements 
salaries and burden expenses increased million and stock compensation expense increased million 
the company did not record stock compensation expense during  as the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  see note 
operating profit operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  which decreased million from million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating profit increased to in from in  but decreased from in this increase was primarily the result of the company s performance in on two fixed price contracts that did not recur in construction segment twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands gross revenue    less intercompany revenue  total revenue pipeline    non pipeline    total revenue    gross profit    operating sg a expense    operating income    revenue the construction segment contributed of our total revenue for  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in the revenue in for this segment increased  or million  from million in additional growth is expected as the demand for pipeline and osha plant inspection  as well as plant turnaround and construction management support projects and high tech maintenance services  continues to be sourced 
the construction segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
a general increase in the construction markets along with increased capital spending in the pipeline area  particularly in inspection services  has contributed to the increases in revenue in the construction segment 
also contributing to the increase in revenue was the acquisition of certain assets  including ongoing projects  of watco management in the fourth quarter of the revenue from this segment comes entirely from field services that are not typically limited to one project 
the company s past experience with this activity is that the term of these assignments on average spans multiple projects and multiple years 
gross profit the construction segment s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in in  this segment s gross profit increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue gross profit increased by  from in to in  but it decreased in from in there has been a significant increase in activity for this segment resulting in higher gross profits 
gross profit as a percent of revenue has also increased due to higher margin services  such as turnaround support and high tech maintenance  provided as a result of the acquisition of certain assets of watco management in the fourth quarter of operating selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the construction segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in  but it increased in from in the construction segment s sg a expenses increased million in over mainly due to increases in salaries and related employee expenses of  overhead positions were added to accommodate the internal and acquisition related growth of this segment 
additionally  facilities expense increased  as a result of additional office space leased to house acquired operations 
the million increase in our construction segment s sg a expenses in over was mainly attributable to salaries and related employee expenses of  facilities and office expenses increased  and stock compensation expense increased  the company did not record stock compensation expense during  as the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  see note 
operating profit this segment s operating profit increased million to million in from million in  and it increased  in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating profit increased to in from in  but it decreased in from in automation segment twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands gross revenue    less intercompany revenue    total revenue fabrication    non fabrication    total revenue    gross profit    operating sg a expense    operating income revenue the automation segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in this segment s revenue also increased in  or million  from million in the company began to focus more on automation services beginning in and began marketing them more aggressively at that time 
refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates 
this  together with the acquisition of analyzer technology international  inc ati in january  has increased the demand for automation services 
another factor positively affecting the automation business is that the computer based distributed control systems equipment used for facility plant automation becomes technologically obsolete over time  supporting ongoing replacement 
the automation segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
gross profit the automation segment s gross profit decreased million  or  from million in to million in in  it increased million  or  from million in also  as a percent of revenue  gross profit decreased by from in to in  and it increased in from in during  the automation segment expanded into several new regions  resulting in higher increased costs in relation to revenues 
also during  an unanticipated shortage of available experienced labor caused an increase in labor hourly rates of approximately 
during that same period  most material costs unexpectedly increased approximately to  and the price of copper wire increased 
these increases in labor and material costs adversely affected project margins on fixed price projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the automation segment s sg a expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in in  sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in  and it decreased in from in this segment s sg a expenses decreased  in over  mainly due to decreases in salaries and related employee expenses of  salaries and expenses for business development personnel were moved to corporate overhead in july to be consistent with the reporting of these costs throughout the company 
the reduction of overhead personnel and the transfer of automation segment overhead personnel expense to direct expense also contributed to this decrease 
we also recognized professional services savings of  and  less in bad debt expense 
offsetting these savings  amortization costs increased by  of these additional costs   was goodwill impairment 
the automation segment s sg a expenses increased million in over as a result of increased salaries and related employee expenses of  facilities and office expenses increased  for expansion of office and warehouse space 
amortization and depreciation increased  mainly due to a non compete agreement that was entered into with the acquisition of ati in january professional services increased  and stock compensation expense increased  the company did not record stock compensation expense during  as the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  see note 
operating profit this segment s operating profit decreased  to a loss of  in as compared to  in operating profit in increased  from a loss of  in as a percentage of total revenue  operating profit decreased to in from in  but it increased in from in land segment twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands gross revenue   less intercompany revenue total revenue   gross profit   operating sg a expense   operating income  the land segment was created through an acquisition of wrc corporation in may therefore  financial information for only includes seven months of activity compared to a complete year in and there was no activity for for this segment 
revenue the land segment contributed of our total revenues for  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in the wrc corporation acquisition in may was the foundation for this segment 
therefore  financial information only includes seven months of activity 
this acquisition has given englobal additional cross selling capabilities and allows us to offer our clients a turkey solution for a pipeline project from right of way acquisition through the land group to detail design through the engineering group 
a general increase in capital spending by our clients has contributed to this increase in land segment revenue 
we have also been able to increase our client base 
the land segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
gross profit gross profit for our land segment increased million  or  from million in to million in also  as a percent of revenue  gross profit increased by from in to in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the land segment s sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased from in to in the increase is primarily due to the extended months reported for however  in reviewing sg a as a percentage of revenue  there were decreases in facilities  marketing  and salaries and related employee expenses 
in  the houston operations of the former wrc corporation moved into the existing englobal facilities and the engineering segment took over some of the former wrc corporation s facilities in denver 
operating profit the land segment s operating profit increased million to million in from million in  increasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund the business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
our primary source of liquidity during the year ended december  was borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility with comerica bank  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below the comerica credit facility 
cash on hand at december  totaled million and availability under the comerica credit facility totaled million resulting in total liquidity of million 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed price contracts during significant periods of growth  the company loses one or more of its major customers  the company experiences further cost overruns on fixed price contracts  our client mix shifts from our historical owner operator client base to more developer based clients  acquisitions are not integrated timely  or we not able to meet the covenants of the comerica credit facility 
if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities required the use of million  million  and million in net cash in  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash generated from operations was offset by the increase in working capital and the reclassification of accounts and unbilled receivables to a long term note receivable 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to increased trade receivables of million  increased costs in excess of billings of million  and increased notes receivable of million 
the increase in receivables was due to higher revenues and the increase in costs in excess of billings was primarily related to contractual billing milestones on fixed price projects in our automation segment 
the decrease in accounts payable primarily related to sub contractor payments of approximately million related to the epc projects 
the note receivable re classification on the sle project was related to the client s obligation in the principle amount of million 
additional sub contractor and vendor payments of million related to the suspended ethanol project are scheduled for payment through the second quarter of cash flows from operating activities were significantly lower in than in and primarily due to the million in operating losses recorded during on two fixed price epc contracts 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and technical software applications 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software  and equipment  such as upgrades to computers 
our new credit agreement with comerica bank the new credit agreement  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below  limits annual capital expenditures to million 
the investing activity in  which was significantly higher than in and  was primarily a result of the investments made in acquiring wrc corporation  and certain assets of both ati and watco 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities provided cash totaling million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
our primary financing mechanism is our revolving line of credit 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance accounts receivable 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
cash flow from financing activity in  which was significantly higher than in and  was primarily a result of borrowings related to the acquisition activities related to wrc corporation  ati  and watco plus the losses related to the two fixed price contracts 
we anticipate that future cash flows from financing activities will be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
we estimate that payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  will be million 
senior revolving credit facility historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
effective august   the company entered into the new credit agreement with comerica bank  which provides a three year  million senior secured revolving credit facility revolver 
the new credit agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of company s subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  and positions comerica as senior to all other debt 
it replaced a million senior revolving credit facility that would have expired in july the outstanding balance on the new credit agreement as of december  was million 
the remaining borrowings available under the new credit agreement as of december  were million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the new credit agreement will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the fed funds effective rate  plus 
the additional margin ranges from on the alternate base rate loans and to on the libor based loans 
upon maturity  the libor debt will automatically roll into the revolver unless the company elects to renew  at which time a new maturity date and interest rate will be set 
the new credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as of the end of each calendar month  including the following o leverage ratio not to exceed to  o asset coverage ratio to be less than to  and o net worth must be greater than the sum of million plus of positive net income earned in each fiscal quarter after january  plus of the net proceeds of any offering  sale or other transfer of any capital stock or any equity securities 
the new credit agreement also contains covenants that place certain limitations on the company including limits on new debt  mergers  asset sales  investments  fixed price contracts  and restrictions on certain distributions 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the new credit agreement as of december  due to significant losses incurred on two fixed price projects during the third and fourth quarters of  the company requested and was successful in obtaining a waiver and subsequent amendment to the new credit agreement with comerica bank in order to meet the monthly fixed charge ratio 
if we had not been able to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  we may have been unable to make further borrowings and may have been required to repay all loans then outstanding under the comerica credit facility 
letters of credit as of december   the company had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of  to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
the letter of credit was issued in november and covers the policy period from september  through september  long term debt our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note  an increase from million as of december  as of december   the company had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of  to cover self insured deductibles under both our general liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
the letter of credit was issued in november and covers our policy period september  through september  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period and thereafter total in thousands long term debt     contractual interest and discount on certain notes     subtotal long term debt     insurance note payable operating leases       total contractual cash obligations future interest consists primarily of interest on the line of credit under the new credit agreement 
the rate applicable to debt outstanding at december   was and fluctuates with the prime rate 
interest and discount rates on the remainder of the company s notes payable vary from to  with the weighted average being at december  non cash transactions in  non cash transaction included  note receivable issued upon the sale of a building the company owned in baton rouge  louisiana and a note receivable in the principal amount of million issued to south louisiana ethanol sle and evidenced by a hand note filed as exhibits  and 
in  non cash transactions included  notes receivable issued for sale of assets and million notes payable issued for acquisitions 
also in  million of stock was issued associated with the acquisition of wrc corporation 
there were no significant non cash transactions in we also acquired insurance with notes payable of million  million  and  in   and  respectively 
derivative financial instruments we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
long term note receivable in the first quarter of  englobal engineering  inc eei and south louisiana ethanol  llc sle executed an agreement for epc services relating to the retro fit of an ethanol plant in southern louisiana 
the history of the sle project the project is described in note to the company s financial statements included in its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  the third quarter q 
after funding certain initial stages of the project with cash  temporary financing was obtained from sle s bridge lending bank in the amount of million until permanent financing for the project could be obtained 
the parties anticipated that permanent financing would be obtained from other lenders no later than august  sle had engaged a major commercial bank to assist with finding permanent financing 
further  sle informed eei that this commercial del 
bank had obtained permanent financing for numerous other ethanol facilities 
based on this  as well as on conversations between the company s chief executive officer and representatives of this commercial bank  eei expected the financing for the project to be consummated on a timely basis 
given this expectation  together with the favorable prices for corn and for ethanol  and the robust credit markets  eei believed that the project would be successful and commenced work in the fourth quarter of in the late summer of  although sle was current in its payments  it had not obtained permanent financing  corn prices began to increase and ethanol prices began to decline 
accordingly the company decided that it was advisable to obtain security for the amount due 
on august   sle executed a collateral mortgage  a collateral note  and a promissory note in the amount of up to million  securing payment of the amount due  and the company re classed the amounts receivable from sle to a note receivable 
in connection with this promissory note  and as provided for under louisiana law  sle executed another promissory note the hand note on or about october  the hand note had a principle balance of approximately million  constituting all amounts then due 
sle was current on all invoices through september  however  on september   sle requested that eei immediately demobilize its activity and instruct its subcontractors to do the same 
eei complied with this request 
because collectability was not assured  the company reserved the amounts which were in excess of the hand note 
although work has not recommenced on the project and sle has not obtained permanent financing  the company continues to believe that  due to the value of the collateral  the note receivable is fully collectible 
specifically  an updated appraisal from the bridge lending bank s appraiser indicates a fair market value of million  an orderly liquidation value of million  and a forced liquidation value of million 
moreover  sle may seek equity financing for the project in lieu of or in addition to debt financing 
while the company believes that in the event the collateral is liquidated  sle s obligations to the company would be paid in full pursuant to the collateral mortgage in favor of the company  collectability is not assured at this time 
as a result  in the fourth quarter the company recorded a valuation reserve and subsequent charge against bad debt expense in the amount of million to reduce the note receivable to the amount of the hand note 
the company will continue to evaluate the sle situation and  if required in the future  make adjustments to the reserve as necessary to remain in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
contingent liabilities and commitments to our knowledge  the company is not involved in any environmental clean up issues 
the company does not have any product liability issues 
lease commitments are included in footnote of the financial statements 
the company leases all of its office space 
there are no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
income tax provision on july   the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and related implementation issues  which provides guidance on the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under fin  financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
this interpretation also revises the disclosure requirements and was adopted by the company effective as of january  there are currently no material tax positions identified as uncertain for the company or its subsidiaries 
we recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties 
as of december   we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax audits from time to time that could result in proposed assessments 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of such audits  how these audits would be resolved and whether the company would be required to make additional tax payments  which may or may not include penalties and interest 
the company was subject to a federal tax audit for the years and that examination has been closed 
during  the company s subsidiary  wrc corporation was subject to an audit for the pre acquisition fiscal year ending september  there was no material adjustment as a result of this audit  and it has been closed 
the company does not have any other examination on going by the internal revenue service  and the open years subject to audit are currently tax years for most states where the company conducts business  the company is subject to examination for the preceding three to six years 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable decreased from days at december   to days at december  our actual bad debt expense has been approximately 
and 
of revenue for the years ended december  and we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from  to million or of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters may be less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company s revenue is recognized under cost plus contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition 
during the fourth quarter  the collectability of revenue for the sle project became questionable 
therefore  we did not recognize any revenue on this projects during the fourth quarter of most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections has resulted in a serious impact in the company s liquidity 
also  the company is engaging in more development contracts with smaller companies 
we anticipate that collection risk will be greater on these projects 
however  as a result of the sle project collection issues  we have instituted new policies relating to ascertaining the creditworthiness of new customers 
our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts typically smaller contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with a maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
during and  pass through transactions totaled million and million  respectively profits and losses on fixed price contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are components one level below our reportable operating segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates which are based on our internal operating budgets 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could results in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied value fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it negatively impacts our results of operations and financial position 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis for the year ended december  indicated impairment to the recorded value of a goodwill asset within our automation segment  specifically of englobal systems  inc esi 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of  in our automation segment in the quarter ended december  the impairment stemmed primarily from a continuing decline in operating results and reduced cash flows from esi 
the  charge was a full impairment of the goodwill asset previously allocated and recorded to esi as a result of the merger between industrial data systems corporation and petrocon engineering  inc in december the company did not have any impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
as of december   or december  impairment and restructuring except as described above  there was no additional impairment recognized as of december  recognition of goodwill impairment for the systems component did not cause impairment of any other goodwill in the automation segment 
the restructuring of the segments was not a result of goodwill impairment recognition nor did the restructuring of the segments create the goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  there were no restructuring charges incurred for the year ended december  the closure of the company s dallas office in march  as disclosed in the k  did not result in any restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges incurred for the years ended december   and december  deferred tax the company had net deferred tax assets of million and million on its balance sheet for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are primarily related to timing differences and are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work  and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and the terms of change orders are agreed upon with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders

inflation and changing prices the company is planning to implement certain provisions in its fixed price contracts  which would allow the company to recover a portion of certain unforeseen price changes in materials and labor that are not in the range of normally expected inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no
