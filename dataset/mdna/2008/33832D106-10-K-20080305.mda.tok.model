item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of this decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the us population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
however  it appears to us that some investors may be assuming that the improvements in financial results realized at these types of communities during the past few years may continue indefinitely 
the reported sales prices being paid today for some independent and assisted living communities seem to exceed replacement cost  including fill up losses 
we are concerned that new development activity may occur in the near future  and it is currently unclear whether this activity will result in excess or moderate new supply which can be absorbed without adversely affecting existing market conditions in this industry 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many nursing homes to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new nursing homes by most states  has caused nursing care to be delivered in many older facilities 
we believe that many nursing homes currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that eventually political pressures from an aging population will cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in skilled nursing facilities 
we believe that if we are successful in our operation of our rehabilitation hospitals  our reputation in the rehabilitation business including providing outpatient rehabilitation services will be enhanced 
a reputation for providing high quality rehabilitation services may help create opportunities to acquire additional irfs or to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
we believe the mpdima will also increase the demand for pharmacy products and services by medicare beneficiaries but may reduce profitability  as the government implements various cost control procedures 
we cannot predict the net impact of the mpdima at this time 
we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses were wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 
pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 
rent expense we lease of our senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing and four senior living communities from hcpi 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities  hospitals and pharmacies 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own  and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business that we began to operate in october in the senior living community segment  we operate independent living and congregate care communities  assisted living communities and nursing homes 
our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient health rehabilitation services at our two hospital locations and three satellite locations and outpatient health rehabilitation services at outpatient clinics 
we did not report our rehabilitation hospital business as a separate segment in since we only began to operate these hospitals in october we do not consider our pharmacy operations to be a significant  separately reportable segment of our business but we report our pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states 
we use segment operating profit as an important measure to evaluate our performance and for business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit excludes interest and other income  interest expense and certain corporate expenses

management fees to sls were eliminated after our termination of the last of our management agreements with sls in the rent expense increase in over is due to the communities that we began to lease in  percentage rent payment in and our payment of additional rent for senior living community capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our communities as well as the one community we acquired in april our interest and other expense decreased by because in february we prepaid six hud insured mortgages that were secured by five of our communities 
we recognized a net gain of million on extinguishments of these mortgages that consisted of the elimination of million of debt premium offset by  in prepayment penalties 
in april  we prepaid an additional hud insured mortgage that was secured by one of our communities 
we recognized a net gain of  on extinguishment of this mortgage that consisted of the elimination of million of debt premium offset by  in prepayment penalties 
this decrease was partially offset by interest we incurred on a million hud insured mortgage that we assumed in connection with the community we acquired in april rehabilitation hospitals the increase in hospital revenues  hospital expenses  rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense from our hospitals in over is a result of our beginning operations at our hospitals in october we are currently experiencing losses from our operation of these rehabilitation hospitals  and we may be unable to operate these hospitals profitably 
the percentage of patients at one of our hospitals who are required to meet certain medicare criteria increased to on july  and this percentage requirement was scheduled to increase to at the other hospital on january   and to at both of our hospitals in the future 
however  this medicare requirement has recently been rolled back to for both hospitals for fiscal years starting on and after july  we believe that we are in compliance with these current medicare requirements 
effective for payment units on and after april   medicare rate increases for these hospitals are set at zero percent for federal fiscal years and we believe the recent roll back may allow us to operate these hospitals profitably  but expect this profit if it occurs to be modest  because of zero medicare rate increases scheduled for and corporate and other the and in increase in revenues and expenses  respectively from our pharmacies is primarily the result of our acquiring one pharmacy in each of may and november the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  over the same period in results from our acquisition of communities in the third and fourth quarters of  from the communities we began to operate in that were previously managed for us by sls and from the rehabilitation hospitals we began to operate in october the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  over the same period in is primarily attributable to increases in assets associated with our pharmacy acquisitions 
our interest and other income decreased by  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a million payment from healthsouth in to settle numerous transition matters and claims related to our assumption of the operations of the two rehabilitation hospitals  offset by interest income on higher levels of investable cash in resulting from our notes offering

the increase in senior living revenue at the communities that we have operated continuously since january  is due primarily to higher per diem charges to residents 
our increase in senior living wages and benefits costs is primarily due to wages and benefits at the six communities we acquired in june  the communities we acquired in the third and fourth quarter of and wage increases 
the increase in other senior living operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  primarily results from the other operating expenses at the six communities we acquired in june  the communities we acquired in the third and fourth quarters of and increased charges from third parties 
the senior living community expenses for the senior living communities that we have operated continuously since january  have increased by  principally due to wage and benefit increases 
management fees to sls decreased due to our termination of management agreements in november  one agreement in february  agreements in june and seven agreements in december the rent expense increase is primarily due to the communities that we began to lease in and and our payment of additional rent for senior living community capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  in april  we sent notices to sls to terminate management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls then managed for us 
on june   we paid sls termination fees totaling million and terminated the sls management agreements for these communities 
in december  we terminated the last seven agreements under which sls managed senior living communities for us and paid sls termination fees totaling million 
we no longer pay management fees to sls 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  over the same period in is primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our communities 
our interest and other expense increased in by primarily due to the mortgages we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions 
rehabilitation hospitals the increase in hospital revenues  hospital expenses  rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense from our hospitals in over is a result of our beginning operations at our hospitals in october corporate and other the and increase in revenues and expenses  respectively from our pharmacies is primarily the result of our acquiring one pharmacy in each june  december  may and november the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  over the same period in results from the six communities we acquired in june  the communities in the third and fourth quarters of  from the communities we began to operate in that were previously managed for us by sls and from the rehabilitation hospitals we began to operate in october the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to increases in assets associated with our pharmacy acquisitions 
our interest and other income increased by million or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as a result of a payment from healthsouth to settle numerous transition matters and claims related to our assumption of the operations of the two rehabilitation hospitals 
the amount of this settlement was approximately million 
interest and other income also increased as a result of higher levels of investable cash and increased yields on our cash and investments 
our interest and other expense increased by  due to the issuance of the notes in october we did not recognize any federal taxes for the year ended december  discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two communities in each of and liquidity and capital resources we believe that a combination of our cash on hand  our efforts to increase revenues and contain costs  our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility and our ability to sell to senior housing certain capital improvements made to communities that we lease from senior housing will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
recent developments investments at december   we had million invested in ars  which we classified as current assets and  in ars included in our self insurance reserves classified as restricted investments on our balance sheet 
as of february   we have million and  of ars in these accounts  respectively 
after successful auctions in january  starting in february  as a result of recent changes in the capital markets  auctions affecting approximately million of our ars failed to close on their settlement dates 
we do not know if auctions affecting the balance of our ars  or future auctions for the ars securities which have failed  will successfully close on future auction settlement dates 
our ars consists primarily of bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the federal family education loan program 
the maturities of our ars range from to however  historically we have had the option to liquidate our investments in the ars whenever the interest rates are reset at auctions  usually every days 
all of our ars were rated aaa by at least one nationally recognized debt rating agency when we made these investments  and  to our knowledge  none of these ratings have been reduced 
pursuant to the terms of our ars  whenever reset auctions fail to close  the interest payable to us on these ars increases 
we are presently monitoring developments in the ars markets together with the broker dealer who has marketed the ars which we own  but based upon our analysis of impairment factors  we have determined that our ars are not impaired at this time and that the value of these investments is approximately equal to their carrying value 
the funds which we invested in ars were funds we were holding to invest in potential acquisitions which we have not yet identified or to satisfy longer term self insurance obligations 
accordingly  these funds are not needed to fund our current operations and we do not expect that the failure of auctions affecting our ars holdings to have a material adverse impact upon us  unless the ars market remains illiquid for an extended period  our ars ratings are reduced and or the value of these securities declines 
nonetheless  the current illiquidity of these investments may mean we are unable to take advantage of other investment opportunities which would grow our operating businesses 
assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
our current liabilities were million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in both current assets and current liabilities is primarily the result of our prepayment of seven mortgages in our leases with senior housing as of december   we leased senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing under six leases 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay minimum rent of million annually and percentage rent for most of senior living communities but not our rehabilitation hospitals 
we paid approximately million and million in percentage rent to senior housing for the years ended december  and  respectively 
upon our request  senior housing reimburses our capital expenditures made at the communities we lease from senior housing and increases our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
senior housing reimbursed us million during the year ended december  for capital expenditures made at these leased communities and increased our annual rent by million 
the terms of our leases with senior housing contain provisions whereby senior housing may cancel our rights under these agreements upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change of control events 
these leases also limit our ability to create  incur  assume or guarantee indebtedness 
as of march   we believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases with senior housing 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
at some of our communities  operating revenues for nursing home services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues from senior living services were earned primarily at our nursing homes 
we derived and of our senior living revenues from these programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october and  our senior living community medicare rates increased by approximately and  respectively  over the prior period 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the bush administration and certain members of the senate and the house of representatives have proposed medicare and medicaid policy changes and rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or are expected to reduce medicaid funding 
the magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid rate reductions and the impact on us of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses  as well as the impact on us of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  cannot currently be estimated  but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
we began to operate two rehabilitation hospitals in october approximately and of our revenues from these hospitals came from the medicare and medicaid programs for the year ended december  and three months ended december   respectively 
in october  our rehabilitation hospital medicare rates increased by approximately over the prior period 
however  for payment units on and after april   medicare rate increases for these hospitals are set at zero per cent for federal fiscal years and in may  cms issued a rule establishing revised medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program 
as recently amended  the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility s inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of the cms s designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with the cms requirements to remain an irf 
however  the actual percentage of patients at these hospitals who meet these medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or  anticipate or may decline 
our failure to remain in compliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our hospitals 
termination of sls management agreements to better understand the results of our ongoing operating business for the years ended december  and and to enable investors to more readily compare our operating results from those years to prior periods  as well as future years  we believe it may be useful to consider what our results of operations would have been in and  excluding our termination payments to sls 
the information in the following chart should not be considered as an alternative to income loss from continuing operations or income loss from continuing operations per share or any other operating or performance measure established by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations exclude termination expense for certain sunrise management agreements income from continuing operations excluding termination charges insurance recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts 
these increased costs may continue in the future 
acquisitions and related financings between september and december  we agreed to lease from senior housing senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
three of these communities are assisted living communities  three are assisted living communities which offer some skilled nursing services  three are only independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after we added these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with renewal options thereafter 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
in april  we acquired a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million we financed the acquisition by assuming a million non recourse united states department of housing  or hud  insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the interest rate on the assumed hud insured mortgage is 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at this community from their private resources 
in january and february  we leased nine senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
eight of these communities are assisted living communities one of which offers some skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services and one is a continuing care retirement community which offers independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these nine communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases for all of these communities after we added these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with renewal options thereafter 
residents pay a majority of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
we currently intend to lease from senior housing additional senior living communities with a total of units which senior housing has agreed to purchase from three unrelated parties 
all of these communities are assisted living communities 
we expect our rent to senior housing for these communities to be million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after we intend to add these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with renewal options thereafter 
residents pay a majority of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
senior housing s purchase and our lease of these properties are contingent upon further diligence  consent from mortgage lenders and other customary closing conditions 
we can provide no assurance that we will lease these properties 
pharmacies between september and november  we acquired six institutional pharmacies and one mail order pharmacy located in wisconsin  nebraska  california  south carolina and virginia 
our total purchase price for these pharmacies was million  including million in rehabilitation hospitals we commenced operations at our two hospitals on october  our lease with senior housing for these two hospitals expires on june   with one renewal option for an additional years 
our rent payable to senior housing for these hospitals is million per year 
discontinued operations during  we agreed with senior housing that it should sell two assisted living communities in pennsylvania  which we currently lease 
we and senior housing are in the process of selling these assisted living communities and  upon their sale  our annual rent payable to senior housing will decrease by of the net proceeds of the sale to senior housing 
as of december   we have disposed of substantially all of our assets and settled all liabilities related to two senior living communities in pennsylvania 
in december  we decided to sell our institutional pharmacy located in california and our mail order pharmacy located in nebraska 
the assets and liabilities related to these two pharmacies that we expect to sell are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
we have reclassified the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented to show the results of operations of the communities and pharmacies which have been sold or are expected to be sold as discontinued 
a summary of the operating results of these discontinued operations included in the financial statements for the years ended december  and is for the years ended december  revenues expenses net loss equity and debt financings in august and september  we issued  common shares in an underwritten public offering raising net proceeds of million

in april  we issued  common shares in an underwritten public offering raising net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of the proceeds raised in this offering to pay million in termination fees for sls management agreements we terminated in june  and we added the remainder to available cash balances

in april  we financed the acquisition of a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million by assuming a million non recourse hud insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the coupon interest rate on the assumed hud insured mortgage is and its effective market rate is 
contractual obligations table as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands contractual obligations payment due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet total debt obligations are the amounts due under several hud insured mortgages as well as our outstanding notes 
operating lease obligations are the minimum lease payments to senior housing and hcpi through the lease terms ending between and these amounts do not include percentage rent that may become payable under these leases 
other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are primarily insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance 
debt instruments and covenants in june  we amended our revolving line of credit 
the amendment increased the line from million to million  extended the termination date to may  and reduced the annual interest charged by basis points 
our revolving line of credit is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the amount we are able to borrow at any time is subject to limitation based upon qualifying collateral 
we are the borrower under this revolving credit facility and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the facility  which is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries accounts receivable  deposit accounts and related assets 
the facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our properties and has other customary provisions 
in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals  the maximum amount which we may draw under this credit facility may be increased to million 
the termination date may be extended twice  in each case by twelve months  subject to lender approval  our payment of extension fees and other conditions 
as of december  and march   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit facility 
in  we prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities 
we paid million to retire these seven mortgages  which consisted of approximately million in principal and interest and  in prepayment penalties 
because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their face value  we recognized a net gain of million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 
at december   four of our communities remained encumbered by five hud insured mortgages totaling the weighted average interest rate on these mortgages is 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly until maturities at varying dates ranging from january to may these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
as of december  and march   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these mortgages 
in october  we issued million principal amount of notes 
our net proceeds from this issuance were approximately million 
these notes are convertible into our common shares at any time 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  is common shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  starting on april  the notes mature on october  on or after october   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes we redeem  plus any accrued and unpaid interest

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  third party guarantees  material joint ventures or partnerships 
related person transactions we were a owned subsidiary of senior housing before december  on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing and others pursuant to which it was agreed  among other things  that so long as senior housing remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without the consent of senior housing  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will not permit nor take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing as a reit  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events affecting us  as defined  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we have a shared services agreement with rmr we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invests 
at the time of our spin off from senior housing  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
one of our managing directors  mr 
portnoy  is currently a managing trustee of senior housing 
of the senior living communities we operated on december   are leased from senior housing for total annual rent of million 
in addition  we also lease our two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing for a total minimum rent of million 
since january   we have entered into several transactions with senior housing  including in march  we agreed with senior housing that it should sell two assisted living communities in pennsylvania  which we lease from senior housing 
we and senior housing are in the process of selling these assisted living communities and  upon their sale  our annual rent payable to senior housing will decrease by of the net proceeds of the sale to senior housing in accordance with the terms of the lease 
during  as permitted by our leases with senior housing  we sold to senior housing  at cost  approximately million of improvements made to properties leased from senior housing  and  as a result  our annual rent payable to senior housing increased by approximately million 
in january and february  we leased nine senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
eight of these communities are assisted living communities one of which offers some skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services and one is a continuing care retirement community which offers independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these nine communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases for all of these communities after we added these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with renewal options thereafter 
residents pay a majority of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
we currently intend to lease from senior housing additional senior living communities with a total of units which senior housing has agreed to purchase from three unrelated parties 
all of these communities are assisted living communities 
we expect our rent to senior housing for these communities to be million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after we intend to add these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with renewal options thereafter 
residents pay a majority of our charges at these communities from their private resources 
senior housing s purchase and our lease of these properties are contingent upon further diligence  consent from mortgage lenders and other customary closing conditions 
we can provide no assurance that we will lease these properties 
rmr provides certain management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit  and our compensation committee approves his salary 
our compensation committee also approves the costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function 
our share of rmr s costs in providing that function for the years ended  and was   and  respectively 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our most significant landlord  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  our shared services agreement with rmr allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
rmr is beneficially owned by messrs 
barry m 
portnoy  one of our managing directors  and his son  adam d 
portnoy  who is president and chief executive officer and a director of rmr and a managing trustee of senior housing 
messrs 
barry portnoy and gerard martin  our managing directors  are directors of rmr 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we paid to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
rmr is the owner of the buildings in which our corporate headquarters is located 
this lease expires in we recorded rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during  and of million   and  respectively 
this lease has been amended at various times to take into account our needs for increasing space and all amendments to this lease have been approved by our independent directors 
one of our hospitals outpatient clinics leases space from hrpt properties trust  or hrpt  a reit managed by rmr 
we recorded rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during and of  and  respectively 
in december  we began leasing space for a regional office in atlanta  georgia from hrpt 
this lease expires in we recorded rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during and of  and  respectively 
we believe that all our transactions with related parties are on reasonable commercial terms 
we also believe that our relationship with senior housing and rmr benefits us and  in fact  provide us competitive advantages in operating and growing our businesses 
moreover  all transactions between us and related parties  including senior housing and rmr  are approved by our independent directors 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizable value of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations  our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs and our evaluation of impairment factors affecting our ars 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment  and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payors or other obligors  the residents or payors stated intent to pay  the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate impairment in the value of our long lived assets 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected discounted cash flows of properties using standard industry valuation techniques 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at one of our communities  we offer continuing care contracts under which residents may pay admission fees in exchange for reduced charges during their occupancy 
these fees may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record these fees as obligations on our balance sheet and amortize the non refundable amounts into revenue over the actuarially determined remaining lives of the individual residents which are the expected periods of occupancy 
actuarially determined remaining lives are estimates based upon general demographic samplings and averages 
our decision to amortize the non refundable fees over actuarially determined lives is based upon our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for that period 
the actual remaining lives and the actual period of occupancy of the individual residents who pay the non refundable fees may differ materially from these estimates 
in the future  if we find that such differences are material  we may change the actuarial tables which we use and we may change our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for these periods  and these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements 
each of our acquisitions has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party appraisals 
determining reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involves significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves  however  these reserves may prove to be materially inaccurate 
we recently evaluated our ars to determine if they have been impaired and we expect to do so regularly hereafter 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of our ars is less than its estimated fair value  we would record a loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the estimated fair value of our ars by reviewing the ratings of the securities we hold 
we also review any guarantors of our ars  if applicable 
some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals and any errors in our estimates or judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards fair value measurements  or sfas sfas replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective beginning with the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment to fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas allows companies to choose to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings 
fair value treatment for eligible assets and liabilities may be elected either prospectively upon initial recognition  or when an event triggers a new basis of accounting for an existing asset or liability 
sfas will be effective beginning with the first quarter of we do not expect at this time to elect to re measure any of our existing financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of sfas inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the us has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to affect rate increases paid by the medicare and medicaid programs will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our minimum rental obligations to senior housing and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt and notes outstanding on december  would decline by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt and notes outstanding on december   would increase by about million our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in may as of december  and march   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility requires annual interest at libor plus basis points 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term  interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates decreased or increased by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  based on currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
