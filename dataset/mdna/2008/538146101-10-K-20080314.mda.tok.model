we were incorporated in the state of delaware in november and the liveperson service was introduced initially in november on july   we acquired proficient systems  inc  a provider of hosted proactive chat solutions that help companies generate revenue on their websites 
the acquisition added several uk based financial services clients and provided an innovative product marketing team 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of proficient in exchange for million shares of our common stock  valued at million  paid at closing  and up to an additional million shares based on the achievement of certain revenue targets as of march  based on these targets  we issued approximately million additional shares valued at million 
at march   the value of these shares has been allocated to goodwill and we have included these shares in the weighted average shares outstanding used in basic and diluted net income per share 
the net intangibles of and million are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  and december  balance sheets  respectively 
on october   we acquired kasamba inc  a facilitator of online transactions between service providers experts  who provide expert online advice to consumers users for total consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition accelerated our expansion into the business to consumer market  and is expected to extend the value we deliver to our growing base of business customers through a community that will connect consumers with experts in a range of categories

the net intangibles of million are included in assets intangibles  net on our december  balance sheet 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition liveperson provides online engagement solutions that facilitate real time assistance and trusted expert advice 
our hosted software platform creates more relevant  compelling and personalized online experiences 
our primary revenue source is from the sale of the liveperson services under the brand names timpani and liveperson 
with the acquisition of kasamba inc kasamba  on october   we also facilitate online transactions between service providers experts who provide expert online advice to consumers users 
the majority of our revenue is generated from two sources monthly service revenues and related professional services 
because we provide our application as a service  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
the majority of our larger clients also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
we may also charge professional service fees related to additional training  business consulting and analysis in support of the liveperson services 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for small and mid sized businesses smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
we recognize monthly service revenue based upon the fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
when professional service fees provide added value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable  we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance of key milestones within each of the professional services engagements 
if a professional services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the fees  and the related labor costs  ratably over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the client relationship 
for revenue recognized from online transactions between experts and users  we apply emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principle versus net as an agent due to the fact that we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection 
we collect a fee from the user and retain a portion of the fee  and then remit the balance to the expert 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the years december  and includes compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to  but not fully vested as of january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
as well as compensation expense for share based awards granted subsequent to january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine grant date fair value 
as of december  and  there was approximately and million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements  respectively 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to our large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and no single customer accounted for or exceeded of accounts receivable at december  or accounts receivable at december  increased by approximately  net of the proficient acquisition  compared to december   due primarily to an increase in the proportion of receivables due from larger corporate clients that typically have longer payment practices 
this increase and the acquisition of proficient resulted in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of  in the year ended december  goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we will obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we will perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates

revenue the majority of our revenue is generated from two sources monthly service revenues and related professional services 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
the majority of our larger clients also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
the proportion of our new clients that are large corporations is increasing 
these companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards 
as a result  our professional services revenue has begun to increase 
such clients also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements  and are more likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis 
as a result  it is likely that a greater proportion of our future revenue will be generated from such ongoing professional services work 
revenue attributable to our monthly service fee accounted for  and of total liveperson services revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
given the time required to schedule training for our clients operators and our clients resource constraints  we have historically experienced a lag between signing a client contract and recognizing revenue from that client 
this lag has recently ranged from to days
