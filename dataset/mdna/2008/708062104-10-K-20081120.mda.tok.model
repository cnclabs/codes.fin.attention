the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview pennantpark was organized under the maryland general corporation law in january we are an externally managed  closed end  non diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a business 
table of contents development company under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of us private or thinly traded public companies with a market capitalization of less than million  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
our investment activities are managed by pennantpark investment advisers and supervised by our board of directors  a majority of whom are independent of us and pennantpark investment advisers 
under our investment management agreement  we have agreed to pay our investment adviser an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross total assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance 
we have also entered into an administration agreement with pennantpark investment administration 
under our administration agreement  we have agreed to reimburse the administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
our investment objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments primarily in us middle market private companies in the form of mezzanine debt  senior secured loans and equity investments 
we consider our core assets  by value and investment focus  to consist of subordinated debt  second lien secured debt and to a lesser extent  equity investments 
in the current credit environment  we also intend invest selectively in senior secured loans  which we believe offer attractive risk adjusted yields and consider them a part of our core holdings at the present time 
the companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged  often as a result of leveraged buy outs or other recapitalization transactions  and  in most cases  are not rated by national rating agencies 
if such companies were rated  we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade between bb and ccc under the standard poor s system from the national rating agencies 
we expect that our investments in mezzanine debt  senior secured loans and other investments will range between million and million each 
we expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base 
we are currently operating in a severely constrained credit market 
our investment activity depends on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
the turmoil in the credit markets is adversely affecting each of these factors and has resulted in broad based reduction in the demand for  and valuation of  high risk debt instruments 
these conditions may present us with attractive investment opportunities  as we believe that there are many middle market companies with strong balance sheets that need senior secured and mezzanine debt financing 
however  these market conditions are also adversely affecting our portfolio valuations and increase the risk of default among our portfolio companies  which could negatively impact our performance 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt investments  we hold and capital gains and distributions  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine debt or senior secured loans  typically have a term of three to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
interest on debt investments  is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or payment in kind pik 
the principal amount of the debt investments  and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees 
loan origination fees  
table of contents original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized  and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and debt investments as interest income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees to our investment adviser  our allocable portion of overhead under our administration agreement and other operating costs as detailed below 
our management fee compensates our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  consummating and monitoring our investments 
additionally  we pay interest expense on the outstanding debt we accrue under our credit facility 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including the cost of calculating our net asset value  including the cost of any third party valuation services  the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities  fees payable to third parties relating to  or associated with  making investments  including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments  expenses incurred by the investment adviser in performing due diligence and reviews of investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts  federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees  federal  state and local taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  brokerage commissions  fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums  direct costs such as printing  mailing  long distance telephone and staff  fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs  costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the act and applicable federal and state securities laws  and all other expenses incurred by either the administrator or us in connection with administering our business  including payments under our administration agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead  and other expenses incurred by the administrator in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs

for the three months ended september   we purchased million  in one new and five existing portfolio companies with an overall average yield of on debt investments 
critical accounting policies our discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity investments of middle market companies 
all of our investments are recorded using broker dealers quotes  or at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available 
we obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the bid prices obtained from at least two broker dealers if available  otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
if the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment  it may independently value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
debt and equity investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates 
investments purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus 
table of contents amortized premium  which approximates value 
with respect to unquoted investments  our board of directors  together with our independent third party valuation firms  values each investment considering  among other measures  discounted cash flow models  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs in connection with one of our portfolio companies  our board uses the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and or assist us in our valuation of our investment in such portfolio company 
because there are not always readily available markets for many of the investments in our portfolio  we value certain of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but believed not to reflect the fair value of an investment  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our investment adviser  our board of directors also engages one or more independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but believed not to reflect the fair value of an investment 
the independent valuation firm reviews management s preliminary valuations and its own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith  based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  which assists in clarifying the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
adoption of sfas generally requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have adopted sfas on october  this adoption does not affect the pennantpark investment s financial position or its results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement applies to all reporting entities  and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities reported at fair value as a consequence of the election 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have adopted sfas on october  and have 
table of contents made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option to our credit facility liability 
upon our adoption our net asset value increased by million  or per share  due to the fair value adjustment related to our credit facility 
after adoption  subsequent changes in the fair value of our credit facility will be recorded in the statement of operations 
we have not elected to apply the fair value option to any other financial assets or liabilities 
revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt investments with contractual pik interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will generally not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized  and we then amortize such amounts as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and debt investments as interest income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  using the specific identification method  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
payment in kind interest we have investments in our portfolio which contain a pik interest provision 
pik interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income 
for pennantpark investment to maintain its status as a ric  this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though pennantpark investment has not collected any cash with respect to pik investments 
federal income taxes we operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code and intend to continue to do so 
accordingly  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income as defined by the code 
because federal income tax regulations differ from gaap  distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes 
differences may be permanent or temporary 
permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character 
temporary differences arise when certain items of income  expense  gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future 
differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes 
results of operations the overall leveraged finance market has continued to experience pressure which has resulted in depreciation on some of our existing assets and improved risk reward environment for new investments 
we did not experience compromised liquidity during the turmoil in the global credit markets because of our ability to sell our senior secured loans and availability under our credit facility 

table of contents set forth below are the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  and for the period from january  inception through september  we did not experience compromised liquidity during the recent turmoil in the global credit markets because of our ability to sell loans from our senior secured portfolio and availability under our credit facility 
if the valuations of our portfolio companies continue to fall significantly from their present values  we may suffer reduced liquidity under our credit facility because of the asset coverage ratio applicable to business development companies  which generally requires our total assets to be at least of our total liabilities  and because of a requirement that our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility not exceed a certain percentage of the values of our portfolio companies 
investment income investment income for the fiscal year ended september   was million 
interest income from senior secured loan investments totaled million  million from second lien secured debt investments  and million from subordinated debt investments for the same period 
the remaining investment income was primarily attributed to interest income from short term investments and to net accretion of discount and amortization of premium 
the increase in investment income from fiscal year to is due to the growth of our portfolio and the transition of the portfolio from temporary to long term investments 
investment income for the period from january  inception through september  was million and was primarily attributed to senior secured loan investments 
expenses net expenses for the fiscal year ended september   totaled million 
net base management fee for the same period totaled million  performance based incentive fee totaled million  credit facility related expense totaled million and general and administrative expenses totaled million 
the increases in expenses from fiscal year to were due to the growth of our portfolio and the incurrence of additional borrowing costs under our credit facility 
net expenses for the period from january  inception through september  were million 
of these totals  million was attributable to credit facility related expenses  and million to general and administrative expenses including approximately  non recurring  primarily legal and corporate tax expenses 
net base management fee for both periods totaled million 
pennantpark investment advisers did not receive a management or incentive fee for its service performed on our behalf prior to completion of our initial public offering on april  net investment income net investment income totaled million or per share  for the fiscal year ended september   and million or per share for the period from january  inception through september  net realized loss sales and repayments of long term investments for the fiscal year ended september  totaled million and net realized losses totaled million due to sale of senior secured loans 
sales and repayments of long term investments for the period from january  inception through september  totaled million and net realized losses totaled approximately  
table of contents net unrealized depreciation on investments and cash equivalents net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled million and million for the fiscal year ended september  and for the period january  inception through september   respectively 
net decrease in net assets from operations net decrease in net assets resulting from operations totaled million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended september   primarily due to the overall decline in market values for investments held in our portfolio 
net decrease in net assets resulting from operations totaled million or per share for the period from january  inception through september  liquidity and capital resources on june   pennantpark investment entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement among us  various lenders and suntrust bank  as administrative agent for the lenders 
suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets acted as the joint lead arranger and book runner  and bear stearns corporate lending inc acted as joint lead arranger and syndication agent 
as of september   pennantpark investment had outstanding borrowings of million including million temporary draw under the credit agreement  with an average interest rate of 
under the credit agreement  the lenders agreed to extend us credit in an initial aggregate principal or face amount not exceeding million at any one time outstanding 
the credit agreement is a five year revolving facility with a stated maturity date of june  and is secured by substantially all of our investment portfolio assets 
pricing is set at basis points over libor 
pennantpark investment s liquidity and capital resources are also generated and available from cash flows from operations  investment sales and repayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments and cash equivalents 
on september   pennantpark investment had million borrowings including million temporary draw under our senior secured revolving credit facility  and million remained unused subject to maintenance of the applicable total assets to debt ratio of  and a requirement that our outstanding borrowing not exceed a certain percentage of the values of our portfolio companies 
in the future  pennantpark investment may raise additional equity or debt capital off a shelf registration or may securitize a portion of its investments among other considerations 
however  we face and expect to continue to face liquidity constraints under current market conditions  and if such conditions worsen substantially  we may be unable to raise capital at all 
equity capital may be difficult to raise because  subject to some limited exceptions  we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share 
in addition  debt capital  to the extent it is available under stressed credit market conditions  may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions 
furthermore  if the valuations of our portfolio companies continue to fall significantly from their present values  we may suffer reduced availability under our credit facility because such availability depends on our asset coverage  which generally requires that the valuation of our total assets be at least equal to of our total liabilities 
the primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness  investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our shareholders or for other general corporate purposes 
our operating activities resulted in a net use of cash of million for the fiscal year ended september   and our financing activities resulted in a net inflow of cash of million for the same period  primarily from borrowings under our credit facility 
our operating activities resulted in a net outflow of cash equal to million for the period from january  inception through september  and our financing activities resulted in a net inflow of cash of million for the same period  primarily from the issuance of our common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our significant contractual payment obligations for the repayment of outstanding borrowing under the multi currency million  five year  revolving credit facility maturing in june is as follows payments due by period millions total less than year years years more than years senior secured revolving credit facility on september   million remained unused under our senior secured revolving credit facility  subject to maintenance of the applicable total assets to debt ratio of  and a requirement that our outstanding borrowing not exceed a certain percentage of the values of our portfolio companies 
including million temporary draw 
we have entered into certain contracts under which we have material future commitments 
on april  we entered into an investment management agreement with the investment adviser in accordance with the act  effective as of the completion of our initial public offering  pursuant to which the investment adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services 
payments under the investment management agreement in each reporting period are equal to a management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets and an incentive fee based on our performance see note to our financial statements for more information 
pursuant to an administration agreement  dated april   the administrator furnishes us with office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day to day operations 
if requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies  the administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided  which amount will not in any case exceed the amount we receive from the portfolio companies for such services 
payment under the administration agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
if any of our contractual obligations discussed above is terminated  our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase 
in addition  we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we engage in no off balance sheet arrangements  including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices 
distributions in order to qualify as a regulated investment company and to avoid corporate level tax on income  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  to our stockholders on an annual basis 
additionally  we must distribute at least of our income both ordinary income and net capital gains to avoid an excise tax 
distributions declared to stockholders for the fiscal year ended september  and for the period from january  inception through september  totaled million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
we intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
our quarterly dividends  if any  are determined by our board of directors 

table of contents we can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and  if we issue senior securities  we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions at a particular level 
we did not experience compromised liquidity during the continued turmoil in the global credit markets because of our ability to liquidate our portfolio of non core senior secured loans  which totaled million as of september   and availability under our credit facility 
recent developments on september   we filed a form n registration statement with the sec that would permit us to offer  from time to time  up to million of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common stock  preferred stock or debt securities and subscription rights 
the sec declared this statement effective september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the period covered by this report  many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on a floating libor and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
assuming that the balance sheet as of the period covered by this report was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates may affect net income by more than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
in periods of declining interest rates  our cost of funds would decrease  which may reduce our net investment income 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates 
during the period covered by this report  we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
