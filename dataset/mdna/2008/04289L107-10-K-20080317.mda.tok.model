item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof 
we develop and market a comprehensive suite of e commerce software products  as well as provide related services in conjunction with our products  including support and maintenance  professional services  managed application hosting services  estara e commerce optimization services solutions for enhancing online sales and support 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale of software products and related services 
our software licenses are priced based on the size of the customer implementation 
services revenue is derived from fees for recurring services  professional services and education services 
our recurring services revenue is comprised of managed application hosting services  estara e commerce optimization service solutions and support and maintenance 
managed application hosting revenue is recognized monthly as the services are provided based on a per transaction  per cpu or percent of customer s revenue basis 
estara e commerce optimization service solutions are priced on a per transaction basis and recognized monthly as the services are provided 
support and maintenance arrangements are priced based on the level of support services provided as a percent of net license fees per annum 
under support and maintenance services  customers are generally entitled to receive software upgrades and updates  maintenance releases and technical support 
professional and educational service revenue includes implementation  custom application development  technical consulting and educational training 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis 
education services are billed as services are provided 
shift to increasing ratably recognized revenue before  most of our revenue from arrangements involving the sale of our software was derived from perpetual software licenses and was recognized at the time the license agreement was executed and delivery of the software occurred provided that the other criteria of revenue recognition was met 
beginning in the first quarter of  a significant number of our perpetual software licenses also included the sale of our estara e commerce optimization services solutions or managed application hosting services 
as a result of applying the requirements of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to our evolving business model  the revenue from an increasing number of our arrangements is being recognized on a ratable basis over the estimated term of the contract or arrangement 
the addition of estara e commerce optimization services and managed application hosting services solution offerings introduced new products in our portfolio for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
as a result  when we sell estara e commerce optimization services solutions and managed application hosting services in conjunction with e commerce software  we defer all fees incurred prior to the delivery of the service solutions and recognize the fees as revenue ratably over either the term of the contract or estimated life of the arrangement depending on the specific facts of the arrangement 
in the longer term  we expect this transition to result in greater stability and predictability in our revenues  and a pattern of growth in our total gaap revenue over any current period that is more reflective of our level of business activity in that period 
in the interim  however  the effect of this shift in our business model has been to adversely affect our near term revenue growth and net income 
key measures that we use to evaluate our performance the change to our business model has required our management to re consider the measures that we use to evaluate our business results 
in addition to the traditional measures of financial performance that are reflected in our results of operations determined in accordance with gaap  we also monitor certain non gaap financial measures of the performance of our business 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a 
table of contents company s historical or future financial performance that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in the gaap statement of operations 
among the gaap and non gaap measures that we believe are most important in evaluating the performance of our business are the following we use net income and gross margins on our recurring services revenue and professional services and education services revenue  to measure our success at meeting cash and non cash cost and expense targets in relation to revenue earned 
we use product license bookings  a non gaap financial measure  as an important measure of growth in demand for our atg e commerce platform and the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
we define product license bookings as product license revenue as reported on our statement of operations plus the contract value of licenses executed in the current period less revenue that was recognized from licenses executed in prior periods 
we believe that this measure provides us with an indication of the amount of new software license business that our direct sales team has added in the period 
product license revenue associated with a particular transaction may be deferred for reasons other than the presence of a managed application hosting or estara e commerce optimization solutions arrangement  such as the presence of credit risk or other contractual terms that  under gaap  require us to defer the recognition of revenue 
the deferred revenue for such a transaction may be recognized in a single future period when the conditions that originally required deferral have been resolved  rather than ratably 
we include all additions to deferred product license revenue in our calculation of product license bookings 
we use cash flow from operations as an indicator of the success of the business 
because a significant portion of our revenue is deferred  in the near term our net income may be significantly different from the cash that we generate from operations 
cash flow from operations is typically higher in the quarters following our seasonally stronger product license bookings quarters  which have historically been the fourth and second quarters 
we use recurring services revenue  as reported on our statement of operations  to evaluate the success of our strategy to deliver site independent online services and the growth of our ratable revenue sources 
we expect that recurring services revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue in future periods 
recurring services revenue includes estara e commerce optimization services solutions  application hosting services and support and maintenance related to atg e commerce platform sales 
we use days sales outstanding dso  calculated by dividing accounts receivable in the period by revenue and multiplying the result by the number of days in the period 
we also use a modified dso that adjusts our revenue by the change in deferred revenue during the period to provide us with a more accurate picture of the strength of our accounts receivables and related collection efforts 
the percentage of accounts receivable that are less than days old is an important factor that our management uses to understand the strength of our accounts receivable portfolio 
this measure is important because a disproportionate percentage of our product license bookings often occurs late in the quarter  which has the effect of increasing our dso and modified dso 
trends in on line sales and our business set forth below is a discussion of recent developments in our industry that we believe offer us significant opportunities  present us with significant challenges  and have the potential to significantly influence our results of operations 
trend in on line sales 
the growth of e commerce as an important sales channel is the principal driver for demand for our products and services 
according to forrester research and gartner  e commerce sales grew to billion in and they are projected to grow to billion by online holiday sales grew in  five times the rate of growth for offline stores 
as online sales continue to outpace store growth and the importance of this channel grows  we believe that retailers require more sophisticated e commerce solutions in order to stay competitive on line and increase conversion rates  order size and revenue 
e commerce replatforming 
enterprises periodically upgrade or replace the network and enterprise applications software and the related hardware systems that they use to run their e commerce operations in order 
table of contents to take advantage of advances in computing power  system architectures and enterprise software functionality that enable them to increase the capabilities of their e commerce systems while simplifying operation and maintenance of these systems and reducing their cost of ownership 
in the e commerce software industry  we refer to these major system upgrades or replacements as replatforming 
we believe that on average  customers in our market replatform or refresh their e commerce software approximately every five years 
in large part due to the increased significance of the on line sales channel  industry analysts believe that e commerce is currently in a period of increased replatforming activity  with increased corporate spending on e commerce solutions across many of our markets 
emergence of the on demand model of software as a service 
an important trend throughout the enterprise software industry in recent years has been the emergence of software as a service  or saas 
saas is a software delivery model whereby a software vendor that has developed a software application hosts and operates it for use by its customers over the internet 
the emergence of saas has been driven by customers desire to reduce the costs of owning and operating critical applications software  while shifting the risks and burdens associated with operating and maintaining the software to the software vendor  enabling the customer to focus its resources on its core business 
rapidly evolving and increasingly complex customer requirements 
the market for e commerce solutions is constantly and rapidly evolving  as we and our competitors introduce new and enhanced products  retire older ones  and react to changes in internet related technology and customer demands  coalescence of product differentiators  product commoditization and evolving industry standards 
to succeed  we need to enhance our current products and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with market needs  satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of customers and leverage strategic alliances with third parties in the e commerce field who have complementary products 
international expansion 
we have seen an increase in sales and pipeline growth in europe and india 
we seek to invest resources into further developing our reach internationally 
in support of this initiative we have entered into partnership agreements abroad that will support our continued growth 
as the international market opportunity continues to develop we will adjust our strategy 
competitive trend 
the market for online sales  marketing and customer service software is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
see item  business  for a more detailed discussion of our competition 
recent events on february   we acquired cleverset for approximately million in cash  before adjustments 
cleverset is a provider of automated personalization engines used to optimize e commerce experiences by presenting visitors with relevant recommendations and information 
cleverset s next generation technology has been shown to significantly lift e commerce revenue by increasing conversion rates and order size 
we will offer these services under our estara brand 
we are currently determining the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
we expect cleverset to be dilutive to our earnings in critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for accounts receivable  research and development costs  the impairment of long lived assets and 
table of contents goodwill  income taxes and assumptions for stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations or that concern the specific manner in which we apply gaap 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition we generate revenue through the sale of product software licenses and related support and maintenance services  estara e commerce optimization services solutions  application hosting services and professional services 
please refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a legally binding contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services rendered software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software 
our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
our estara e commerce optimization services solutions and application hosting services are delivered on a monthly basis 
professional services are generally delivered on a time and material basis 
price is fixed or determinable we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
our standard payment terms are primarily net days 
significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable 
we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment constitutes a concession 
our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract terms without providing concessions on licenses  revenue from licenses would be required to be recognized when cash is received 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
collection is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of the cash payment 
our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any arrangement  revenue from the elements of an arrangement would be recognized upon the receipt of cash payment unless other revenue recognition criteria are not met 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents generally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include sales of software licenses and related support and maintenance services in conjunction with application hosting services  estara e commerce optimization services solutions or professional services 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once the revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that our obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
recording revenue from arrangements that include application hosting services require us to estimate the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
pursuant to the application of relevant gaap literature  eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  our arrangements with application hosting services are accounted for as one unit of accounting 
in such situations  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
based on our historical experience with our customers  we estimate the life of the typical customer arrangement to be approximately four years 
our vsoe of fair value for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance is generally based upon our history of charging our customers stated annual renewal rates 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately 
annually  we evaluate whether or not we have maintained vsoe of fair value for support and maintenance services and professional services 
we have concluded that we have maintained vsoe of fair value for both support and maintenance services and professional services because the majority of our support and maintenance contract renewal rates and professional service rates per personnel level fall in a narrow range of variability within each service offering 
for multiple element arrangements  vsoe of fair value must exist to allocate the total arrangement fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a perpetual license arrangement 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered 
in certain instances  we sell perpetual software licenses with application hosting services and estara e commerce optimization services solutions 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for any of these elements 
in these situations all elements in the arrangement for which we receive up front fees  which typically includes perpetual software fees  support and maintenance fees and set up and implementation fees  are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of providing the application hosting service or estara e commerce optimization services solutions 
we allocate and classify revenue in our statement of operations based on our evaluation of vsoe of fair value  or a proxy of fair value thereof  available for each applicable element of the transaction 
we generally base our proxy of fair value on arms length negotiations for the contracted elements 
this allocation methodology requires judgment and is based on our analysis of our sales transactions 
allowances for accounts receivable we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
generally  we record allowances to revenue based on past credit memo history in the professional services business 

table of contents research and development costs we account for research and development costs for our software products that we license to our customers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop software applications used in our estara e commerce optimization services solutions are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
capitalizable costs consist of a certain external direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and b payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with  and who devote time to  the project 
these costs generally consist of internal labor during configuration  coding and testing activities 
research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities  training  maintenance and general and administrative or overhead costs are expenses as incurred 
costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of  and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to  internal use software are also expensed as incurred 
capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete  management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project  it is probable the project will be completed  the software will be used to perform the functions intended and certain functional and quality standards have been met 
our research and development efforts during related to our estara e commerce optimization services were primarily maintenance and data conversion costs 
we did not capitalize any research and development costs during impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  based upon the pattern in which the expected benefits will be realized  or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually  as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if impairment exists 
no impairment of goodwill resulted from our evaluation of goodwill in any of the fiscal years presented  however these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realizability of these assets 
on january  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which did not result in a material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax contingencies 
the total net liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  if these tax positions were settled in our favor these liabilities would be reversed and lower our effective tax rate in the period recorded 
stock based compensation expense since january   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of our underlying common stock 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted

table of contents years ended december   and revenues years ended december  in thousands total revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for  as a result of the acquisition of estara in october which contributed revenue of million in and to growth in professional and educational services revenue of million 
partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in product license revenue of million that was directly a result of the change in our business model requiring us to defer all revenue recognition for fees received up front when software licenses are sold in conjunction with managed application hosting services and or estara e commerce optimization services 
total revenue increased to million for from million for  due to increases in product license revenue of million  managed application hosting revenue of million and professional service revenue of million 
additionally  the fourth quarter of included million of revenue attributable to the estara acquisition 
revenue generated from international customers increased to million  or of total revenue compared to and of revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no single customer accounted for or more of total revenue for the years ended december   or we expect full year revenues in the range of million to million 
product license revenue years ended december  product license revenue as a percent of total revenue product license revenue decreased  to million  for from million in product license revenue increased to million for from million for the decrease for is due to deferrals of license revenue related to multiple element transactions in which we are hosting the software or providing e commerce optimization service solutions 
this license revenue will be recognized ratably over the term or life of the arrangement 
partially offsetting this impact is the recognition of million in product license revenue which was deferred in prior periods 
product license revenue generated from international customers increased to million for from million in product license revenue increased to million for from million for the increase for is due to increased demand for our e commerce product suite due to an improvement in the overall e commerce market 
product license revenue generated from international customers increased to million in from million for due to the development of several new international customers 
product license revenue as a percentage of our total revenue declined to in from in and in this change in revenue mix is due in part to the introduction in late of new services  such as our estara e commerce optimization services  that are recognized ratably and included in our recurring services revenue 
the change in revenue mix is also a result of the change in our business model described above  that has resulted in an increased percentage of our software license revenue being recognized ratably 
we expect that this percentage will increase over time as deferred product license revenue is recognized in future periods 
we expect that this transition in our revenue mix to continue in the near term 
although the diversity of our customers preferences regarding delivery models and business terms and the broad range of our products and services makes it challenging to predict the rate of this transition from quarter to quarter  we expect the percent of 
table of contents our product license revenue that is recognized ratably to increase throughout to approximately on average for the year 
we expect full year product license revenues to increase approximately from product license bookings product license bookings is a non gaap term that we define as product license revenue as reported in our statement of operations plus the net change in deferred product license revenue during the period 
we believe that this measure provides us with a comparable result of the amount of new business that our direct sales team has added in the period 
the following table summarizes our product license bookings for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands product license revenue increase in product license deferred revenue product license deferred revenue recognized product license bookings we expect full year product license bookings to increase approximately from recurring services revenue years ended december  support and maintenance estara e commerce optimization services on demand total recurring services revenue as a percent of total revenue our recurring services revenue increased to million in from million in  as follows support and maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in the increase is due to growth in our installed base of atg e commerce software attributable to the increase in product license bookings partially offset by approximately million of revenue that was deferred due to arrangements that were sold in conjunction with application hosting services or estara e commerce optimization services 
estara e commerce optimization services revenue increased to million in from million in revenues in included the full year s results of estara  which we acquired in october  and represented of total recurring service revenue for compared with in on demand revenue  which represents revenue from arrangements in which we sold our atg e commerce software as a service on a hosted basis  increased to million for from million for our recurring services revenue increased to million in from million in  as follows support and maintenance revenue increased  to million  in from million in the increase is due to growth in our installed base of atg e commerce software 
estara e commerce optimization services revenue increased to million in from a base of zero in as a result of our acquisition of estara in october  and represented of total recurring revenue in on demand revenue increased to million in from million in due to an increase of customers using our managed application hosting services 

table of contents recurring services revenue as a percent of total revenue increased to in  from in and in  consistent with the change in our business model described above 
we expect our recurring services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase in the future 
we expect full year recurring services revenue to increase approximately from  which includes approximately growth in support and maintenance and approximately growth in estara and atg on demand 
professional and educational services revenue years ended december  professional services education total professional education services revenue as a percent of total revenue professional and education services revenue increased to million in from million in  and increased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in  as follows professional services revenue consists primarily of revenue from consulting and implementation services  which typically are performed in the quarters closely following the execution of a product license transaction 
professional services revenue increased to million in from million in  due to an increase in implementation activity associated with growth in our product license bookings in  partially offset by the deferral of revenue for services related to managed application hosting and e commerce optimization arrangements that will be recognized ratably once the services commence 
education revenue  which consists primarily of training of customer personnel  consultants and strategic partners on the use of our products and services  increased to million in from million in the increase is a result of an increased focus on developing our partner and consultant practices 
professional and educational services revenue increased to million in from million in  and represented of total revenue in both and the increase in professional services revenue was driven by the following professional services revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was a result of growth and product license bookings during education revenue increased to million in from million in international professional and educational service revenue increased to million in from million in and million in based on our strategy to expand our partner ecosystem in order to leverage our partners global reach and resources  we are increasingly focusing on testing and certifying partners rather than continuing to grow our professional services business 
for this reason  we expect minimal growth in professional services revenue for the full year of cost of product license revenues years ended december  cost of product license revenue as a percent of license revenue gross margin on product license revenue as a percent of license revenue cost of product license revenue includes salary  benefits and stock based compensation costs of fulfillment and engineering staff dedicated to maintenance of products that are in general release  the amortization of licenses

cost of product license revenue increased to million in from million for gross margin on product license revenue was  or million  in compared to  or million  in the increase in the cost of product license revenue and decrease in gross margin for was driven by an increase in royalty costs due to the mix of products sold and the decrease in product license revenue due to increased deferrals of product license revenue that will be recognized ratably in future periods 
cost of product license revenue was million in and gross margin on product license revenue was  or million  in compared to  or million in the increase in product license gross margin for is attributable to higher product license revenue  partially offset by an increase in royalties 
we expect full year gross margin on product license revenue to approximately be to of product license revenue

when we perform professional consulting and implementation services in connection with on demand application hosting arrangements  we generally defer the cost of our implementation and set up activities and amortize these to cost of revenue ratably over the estimated life of the arrangement once the hosting services commence 
we deferred an aggregate of million of set up and implementation costs in cost of recurring services revenue increased to million in from million in gross margin on recurring services revenue was  or million  in compared to  or million  in the increase in cost of recurring services and the resulting decline in gross margin on recurring services in was due to direct costs associated with estara e commerce optimization services for a full year and to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of estara in the fourth quarter of cost of recurring services revenue increased to million in from million in gross margin on recurring services revenue was  or million  in and  or million  in we expect full year gross margin on recurring services revenue to be to of recurring services revenue

research and development expenses years ended december  research development expenses as a percent of total revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits  and stock based compensation costs to support product development 
to date  all of our software development costs have been expensed as research and development in the period incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from

the increase was due to an increase in cost of million related to the estara acquisition  a million increase in commission expense related to higher product license bookings and increased spending on marketing programs 
we generally recognize commission expense upon contract execution 
this policy has the effect of increasing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue when revenue is deferred and recognized ratably 
as a 
table of contents result  another consequence of our change in business model is that in the near term our sales and marketing expenses are likely to grow at a rate that exceeds the rate of growth in our product license revenue 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  and decreased as a percentage of total revenue to from 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was due to the inclusion of estara expenses of million  including amortization of acquired intangibles for customer relationships and stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r in the decrease as a percentage of total revenue was due to faster growth in revenue than in sales and marketing expenses driven by a million decline in outside marketing services

restructuring in and prior years  we implemented restructuring actions to realign our operating expenses and facilities with the requirements of our business and current market conditions and recorded adjustments to prior restructuring charges 
these actions have included closure and consolidation of excess facilities  reductions in the number of our employees  abandonment or disposal of tangible assets and settlement of contractual obligations 
in connection with these actions we have recorded restructuring charges  based in part upon our estimates of the costs ultimately to be paid for the actions we took 
when circumstances result in changes in our estimates relating to our accrued restructuring costs  we reflect these changes as additional charges or benefits in the period in which the change of estimate occurs 
as of december   we had restructuring accruals of million 
we recorded net restructuring benefits of million in each of and and net restructuring charges of million in for detailed information about our restructuring activities and related costs and accruals  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from our higher average cash and investment balances and foreign currency exchange gains due to continuing weakness in the us dollar versus the us pound sterling and the euro 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million in to million at december  interest and other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to foreign exchange gains in compared to losses in  together with higher interest income in compared to provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million

the primary differences between book and tax income for are the amortization of capitalized research and development expenses and payments on lease restructuring reserves  partially offset by sfas r stock compensation expenses 
we adopted

estara acquisition in october  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of estara  inc estara 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which consisted of million of our common stock  million of transaction costs  which primarily consisted of fees paid for financial advisory  legal and accounting services and a transaction bonus to estara employees of million  and million in cash paid lieu of issuing atg common stock to non accredited investors 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  the fair value of which was based upon a five day average of the closing price two days before and two days after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and publicly announced 
in addition  we issued million shares of restricted stock  which is being recognized as stock based compensation expense over the vesting term 
in the preliminary allocation of the purchase price the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired resulted in goodwill of million 
as required by the merger agreement  in we recorded contingent consideration of million for earn out payments to estara stockholders and employees as a result of estara generating revenue in excess of million but less than million in the earn out payments were made in cash in march and consisted of million for stockholders and million for employees 
the payments to stockholders were recorded as additional purchase price  and the amounts paid to employees were accounted for as compensation expense as it relates to amounts paid to estara employee stockholders in excess of that paid to non employee stockholders 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements 
our primary sources of liquidity at december  were our cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term marketable securities of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in although we incurred a net loss of million  it included non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of million  and stock based compensation expense of million 
deferred revenue increased million during the year 
most of the invoices related to this deferred revenue were collected in and therefore increased our cash flow from operations 
under applicable revenue recognition rules  a portion of this amount was not recognized as revenue in as discussed earlier  thereby lowering our net income 
accounts receivable increased million  or in the increase in accounts receivable is due to a  or million  increase in revenue and a million increase in product license deferred revenue partially offset by collections of outstanding accounts receivable balances 
accrued expenses increased million in due to higher operating expenses in we will be required to pay cash in future periods for these expenses that were recorded in we deferred million of costs related to the implementation of customer websites during deferring these costs has the effect of a cash outflow in that will be recorded as expense in future periods

on april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program providing for repurchases of our outstanding common stock of up to million  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  at times and prices considered appropriate depending on prevailing market conditions 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  of shares of our common stock at a 
table of contents cost of million 
we have authorization to expend an additional million under this program as of december  we believe that our balance of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   along with other working capital and cash expected to be generated by our operations  will allow us to meet our liquidity requirements over at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may find it necessary or advisable to seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we have made the following disbursements in related to current and prior business acquisitions we paid approximately million in february in connection with the cleverset acquisition and we paid million in march in contingent consideration related to the estara acquisition 
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding and modified days sales outstanding for the fourth quarter ended december  and were as follows quarter ended december  dollar amounts in thousands days sales outstanding revenue accounts receivable  net modified days sales outstanding percent of accounts receivable less than days we evaluate our performance on collections on a quarterly basis 
as of december   our days sales outstanding decreased from december  due to collections on support and maintenance renewals as well as the effect of receiving payments on sales that were made during the current and previous quarter 
credit facility at december   we maintained a million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank the bank  pursuant to an amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement dated as of june   which provides for borrowings of up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible intellectual and personal property and is subject to financial covenants including profitability and liquidity coverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants in the loan agreement  as amended 
while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   the bank had previously issued letters of credit totaling million on our behalf  which were supported by this facility 
the letters of credit were issued in favor of various landlords to secure obligations under facility leases pursuant to leases expiring through december as a result  at december   approximately million was available under the facility 
on january   we allowed the credit facility to expire and accordingly  we cash collateralized the million in letters of credit with certificates of deposit  which will be reflected on subsequent balance sheets as restricted cash

 fair value measurements statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
statement also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp b  which delays the effective date of statement for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
statement and fsp b are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of statement under the provisions of fsp b related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment and valuing liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
the impact of partially adopting statement effective january  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas statement  which permits but does not require us to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has not been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as we have not elected to fair value any of our financial instruments under the provisions of statement  the adoption of this statement will not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  statement r  a replacement of fasb statement no 
statement r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
statement r provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  statement r changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met at the acquisition date  and in process research and development charges will no longer be recorded 
while there is no expected impact to our consolidated financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to december   the adoption of statement r on january  could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to that date

r  share based payment 
the 
table of contents use of the simplified method was scheduled to expire on december  sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants and we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient data to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities at december  and primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of foreign currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries and accounts receivable valued in the united kingdom in us dollars 
our primary foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the british pound and euro  and foreign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured each reporting period with any exchange gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on currency exposures existing at december  and  a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  at december   we had no outstanding derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
