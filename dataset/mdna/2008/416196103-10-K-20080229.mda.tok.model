capital resources are also available from and provided through our unsecured credit facilities  subject to the terms and conditions of those facilities 
the amount of cash on hand and borrowings available under our credit facilities are influenced by a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  revenue growth  accounts receivable collections  capital expenditures  tax payments  share repurchases  acquisitions and dividends 
based on our current operational plans  we believe that our credit facilities  together with cash provided by operating activities  will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures  payments of principal and interest on our borrowings  and dividends on our common stock for at least the next twelve months 
as of december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we did not have any unused borrowing capacity under our term loan facility 
as of february   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our bridge facility that we entered into in january  which matures on july  subject to market conditions  we anticipate entering into an approximately million  longer term credit facility prior to the maturity date of the bridge loan facility  at which time we intend to repay any amounts then owed under the bridge loan facility 
we intend to utilize the availability under this anticipated longer term credit facility primarily to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock and for other general corporate purposes 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that  in our judgment  are most important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results of operations and which require complex or subjective judgments or 
table of contents estimates 
the areas that we believe involve the most significant management estimates and assumptions are detailed below 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv the service has been performed or the product has been delivered 
payments received in advance of the performance of services or delivery of the product are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the services are performed or the product is delivered 
our accounting policy for revenue recognition has an impact on our reported results and relies on certain estimates that require judgments on the part of management 
the portion of our revenue that is most subject to estimates and judgments is revenue recognized using the proportional performance method  as discussed below 
direct marketing revenue is derived from a variety of services and products  and may be billed at hourly rates  monthly rates or a fixed price 
for all sales  we require either a purchase order  a statement of work signed by the client  a written contract  or some other form of written authorization from the client 
revenue from database design and development  market research  agency services  analytical services  and creative are typically billed based on time and materials or at a fixed price 
if billed at a fixed price  revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis as the services specified in the arrangement are performed 
proportional performance is based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred  primarily labor hours and outsourced services  represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures or contract performance 
progress on a contract is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
provision for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
management estimates and judgments are used in connection with determining the revenue recognized in these instances 
should actual costs differ significantly from the original estimated costs  the timing of revenues and overall profitability of the contract could be impacted 
contracts accounted for under the proportional performance method constituted less than of total direct marketing revenue and less than of our total revenue for the years ended december   and revenue from technology database subscriptions is based on a fixed price and is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
revenue from database and website hosting services is recognized ratably over the contractual hosting period  and pricing is typically based on a fixed price per month or price per contract 
revenue from services such as data processing  printing  personalization of communication pieces using laser and inkjet printing  targeted mail  fulfillment  email marketing and transportation logistics are recognized as the work is performed 
revenue from these services is typically based on a fixed price or rate given to the client 
revenue related to e care including online technical support and inbound email management  inbound and outbound telemarketing  and sales lead management is also typically based on a fixed price per transaction or service provided 
revenue from these services is recognized as the service or activity is performed 
revenue from software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair values of the respective elements 
for software sales with multiple elements for example  software licenses with undelivered post contract customer support or pcs  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value 
table of contents of the undelivered elements 
this means we defer revenue from the software sale equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the fair value of pcs is based upon separate sales of renewals to other clients 
the fair value of services  such as training and consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other clients 
the revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenue allocated to professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue allocated to software products  including time based software licenses  is recognized  if collection is probable  upon execution of a licensing agreement and shipment of the software or ratably over the term of the license  depending on the structure and terms of the arrangement 
if the licensing agreement is for a term of one year or less and includes pcs  we recognize the software and the pcs revenue ratably over the term of the license 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our hosted software service transactions 
for certain non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting  provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue from these services is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
as described above  sometimes our customer arrangements have multiple deliverables  including service elements 
generally  our multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of specific accounting standards that provide guidance regarding the separation of elements in multiple deliverable arrangements and the allocation of consideration among those elements eg  aicpa sop software revenue recognition 
if not  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the provisions of eitf require us to unbundle multiple element arrangements into separate units of accounting when the delivered element s has stand alone value and fair value of the undelivered element s exist s 
when we are able to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to each unit 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above to the entire arrangement 
this might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized from the arrangement 
shopper services are considered rendered  and the revenue recognized  when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the mailing material has been received by the united states postal service 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not reflected in our revenues or expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts at a balance adequate to reduce accounts receivable to the amount of cash expected to be realized upon collection 
the methodology used to determine the minimum allowance balance is based on our prior collection experience and is generally related to the accounts receivable balance in various aging categories 
the balance is also influenced by specific clients financial strength and circumstance 
accounts that are determined to be uncollectible are written off in the period in which they are determined to be uncollectible 
periodic changes to the allowance balance are recorded as increases or decreases to bad debt expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line 
table of contents of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded bad debt expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if future bad debt expense exceeds the estimated reserve 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability our deductible for individual healthcare claims is million 
our deductible for workers compensation is million 
we have a million deductible for automobile and general liability claims 
our insurance administrator provides us with estimated loss reserves  based upon its experience dealing with similar types of claims  as well as amounts paid to date against these claims 
management makes various subjective judgments about a number of factors in determining our reserve for healthcare  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance  and the related expense 
if ultimate losses were higher than our estimate at december   net income would be impacted by approximately million  net of taxes 
the amount that earnings would be impacted is dependent on the claim year and our deductible levels for that plan year 
periodic changes to the reserve for workers compensation  automobile and general liability are recorded as increases or decreases to insurance expense  which is included in the advertising  selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statement of operations 
periodic changes to the reserve for healthcare are recorded as increases or decreases to employee benefits expense  which is included in the payroll line of our consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill goodwill is recorded to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are periodically tested for impairment 
we assess the impairment of our goodwill in accordance with sfas  by determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing the fair value to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
we have identified our reporting units as direct marketing and shoppers 
fair value is determined using projected discounted future cash flows and cash flow multiple models  based on historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we must calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities recognized and unrecognized in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and then compare this implied fair value to its carrying amount 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded 
both the direct marketing and shoppers segments were tested for impairment using november as our valuation date 
we have not recorded an impairment loss in any of the three years ended december  significant estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow model include weighted average cost of capital and the long term rate of growth for each of our reporting segments 
these estimates require management s judgment 
any significant changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could have an impact on this annual analysis 
at december  and  our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units as of december  were well in excess of the reporting units carrying values 

table of contents stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
prior to january   we accounted for share based awards under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  prior to january   no compensation expense was recognized for share based awards granted where the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including in some cases estimating expected term  volatility and dividend yield 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from some of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded total stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future 
our adoption of sfas r  business combinations  in will affect the way we account for acquisitions  including acquisition related costs  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration  and may also impact the amount of information we disclose about acquisitions 
the adoption of the remaining new accounting pronouncements discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements have not and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risks related to interest rate variations and to foreign exchange rate variations 
from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments as described below to manage our exposure to such risks 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our credit facilities 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our credit facilities  which bear interest at variable rates based on eurodollar rates effective rate of at december  
the five year million revolving credit facility has a maturity date of august  at december   our debt balance related to the revolving credit facility was million 
the five year million term loan facility has a maturity date of september  at december   our debt balance related to the term loan facility was million 
in september  we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million and a fixed rate of in order to limit a portion of our interest rate exposure by converting a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we are also subject to interest rate risk on our swap if interest rates decrease 
to manage this risk  we may refinance all or a portion of this swap at then existing market interest rates 
assuming the actual level of borrowing throughout  and assuming a one percentage point change in the year s average interest rates  it is estimated that our net income would have changed by approximately million 
due to our interest rate swap  overall debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we currently have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates 

table of contents our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result of our operations in foreign countries  a portion of which are conducted in foreign currencies 
we monitor these risks throughout the normal course of business 
due to the current level of operations conducted in foreign currencies  we do not believe that the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is significant to our overall earnings 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging 
we do not speculate using derivative instruments
