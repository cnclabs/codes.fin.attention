item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  our operating results improved significantly over the prior year due primarily to increased revenues and improved services gross margins 
we achieved these results by successfully executing our strategies to focus on our target customers  increase our services revenues  and align our sales efforts with our manufacturers go to market strategies 
to increase services revenues we expanded our wholesale services offering through by penetrating existing accounts and developing new relationships 
both elements proved successful in fiscal our wholesale service strategy is based on partnering with manufacturers  network service providers  and large integrators wholesale customers to provide services to their end user customers 
typically  we provide field services or specific technical expertise to supplement core services to the end user provided by our wholesale customers 
our ability to support multiple manufacturer platforms is also often a key consideration in this market 
our success in expanding our wholesale services revenues was an important contributor to our revenue growth in fiscal this is discussed more fully below 
in fiscal we also improved our alignment with avaya and nortel  our major business partners 
our business strategy emphasized approaching the market in a manner that best capitalized on each manufacturer s portfolio of products and services 
for avaya  this meant partnering with them to sell equipment to the enterprise market and selling their service capabilities and maintenance contracts 
for nortel  this meant approaching the market with a regional focus and aligning our sales efforts with nortel s regional sales management 
additionally  we assigned senior sales management to each product line to maximize progress on these initiatives 
we plan to build on our successes in fiscal by continuing to focus on the above strategies  particularly our wholesale services strategy 
we are targeting a mix of revenues of approximately services revenues and systems sales 
we expect to achieve this target in the next three to five fiscal years 
traditionally  our revenue mix has been approximately 
by increasing the mix of recurring  higher gross margin services revenues to a greater proportion of total revenues  we will improve the predictability of our results and increase our blended gross margins 
also in fiscal  we expect slower growth in our operating expenses as we increase administrative efficiencies 
we believe our efforts will produce continued improvement in both revenues and profitability in fiscal in november  we announced that we had been awarded a series of orders from miami dade county public schools mdcps to sell and install new communications systems at certain schools in the mdcps district 
based on current installation schedules  we expect to recognize most of this revenue in fiscal as such  these orders should have a material positive impact on our fiscal results see comments regarding the risks associated with these orders under risk factors above 
due to the magnitude of these orders  the proportion of equipment revenues to services revenues  and the relatively compressed installation schedule  the mix of our revenues in fiscal may not reflect our targeted long term mix 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends that affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations fiscal year  compared to fiscal year net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this growth reflects continued success in all three major services revenue streams including our recurring services  implementation services  and our national cabling business 
recurring services  which consists of revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m based charges  increased million or in fiscal compared to last year  primarily reflecting our success in the expansion of our wholesale services initiative 
revenues from our wholesale services programs are in the form of contract maintenance fees and or time charges for services provided 
some accounts provide additional revenues from minimum monthly charges 
a key aspect to our success with these programs has been our flexibility in structuring the service delivery model to meet the unique needs or demands of our customers end users 
we believe that expansion of these revenues represents a critical success factor for us in the future as we seek to increase the mix of these recurring revenues as a percentage of our overall revenues 
our implementation revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
the growth in our implementation revenues was a key factor in our success in fiscal as higher levels of revenues resulted in better absorption of the significant fixed cost structure in this portion of our services organization 
the growth rate is significantly greater than our growth in systems sales  the historical driver of these revenues 
the additional growth came from several large installation and professional services contracts sold separately from systems sales 
additionally  the proportion of installation and professional services fees continues to increase in comparison to the total project price as the complexity of the applications we sell increases 
all of these increased revenues improved our utilization of our resources and contributed to the overall increase in our services gross profits which are discussed below 
our structured cabling revenues grew to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in these revenues is the result of our continued success in establishing a national structured cabling business that markets our cabling services to existing and new customers 
with this product and service offering  we are better able to compete for projects where structured cabling is wrapped into an overall communications infrastructure purchase 
we are also able to compete for stand alone structured cabling business often associated with new construction 
systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal the increase in sales of systems to commercial customers is primarily the result of the success of our strategy to focus on our manufacturers lines of business  particularly the nortel product line 
as discussed above  we have received a series of orders from mdcps to sell and install over million of avaya communications systems to the school district 
about of the value of each of these orders will be recognized as systems sales and if current shipping schedules hold  we expect this revenue to be recognized in fiscal sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  an increase compared to the prior year 
this increase reflects our strong market position in the growing hospitality market and the acceptance of our nortel product line to hospitality customers 
while we expect to continue to have success in this market  we expect our growth rates in fiscal to be lower than this year 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other revenues consist of commissions earned on the sale of avaya maintenance contracts and sales of equipment and or services made outside of our normal provisioning processes 
the increase in other revenues is attributable to an increase in the sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts 
under our dealer agreement with avaya  we are incentivized to market their maintenance contracts to the avaya customer base 
we are paid a commission on these contracts based on the size and length of the contract and the underlying equipment covered under the agreement 
sales of products provisioned outside of our normal processes generally reflects sales of phone sets to hospitality customers in which we earn a small  flat  per phone profit on the transaction 
other revenues also include restocking fees earned on canceled orders 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase reflects improvements in gross margins earned on recurring services and implementation revenues  while gross margins on cabling revenues were relatively flat compared to last year 
the margins on recurring services improved slightly due to better utilization of our care center and field services personnel  lower materials costs and improved utilization of qualified third party service providers 
the profitability of implementation and professional services was the largest contributor to the significant increase in overall services profitability 
as discussed above under services revenues  increased implementation revenues resulted in improved absorption of the fixed costs of this element of our services organization 
the gross margins earned on cabling revenues were consistent with fiscal and with our expectations 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins are consistent with our expectations for systems sales 
we maintain a high focus on systems sales margins through controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews 
we also work closely with both our manufacturers and our product distributors to maximize vendor support through their rebate  promotion  and competitive discount programs 
these programs were relatively unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that despite a highly competitive market  we can maintain our gross margins on systems sales 
however  we can give no assurance regarding possible changes in our vendor support programs that could either increase or lower margins 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues 
these include costs incurred to market and administer the avaya post warranty maintenance contracts we sell  and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
while we earn a commission on the sale of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts which has no direct cost of goods sold  we incur costs in marketing and administration of these contracts before submitting them to avaya 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in operating expenses is due to increased sales expenses to support our wholesale services sales initiative  increased gross profit and net income based incentive payments to employees due to improved profitability  increased fas r compensation expense due to the issuance of stock options in fiscal and  increased amortization expense from the expanded utilization of our enterprise technology platform  and increased marketing expenses related to a major marketing event held around the pga championship during our fourth fiscal quarter 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense decreased in fiscal by approximately  this change primarily reflects lower overall borrowing costs in compared to last year due to less outstanding debt 
during fiscal  we reduced our mortgage debt by  through cash on hand and funds generated from operations and enjoyed lower average amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  in tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this increase reflects improved gross profit margins partially offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above 
our current business model targets an operating margin of to to be reached in the next three to five years 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  continued improvements in total gross margins  and a significantly slower growth rate in operating expenses to meet this target 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal we experienced very weak demand for systems in our first quarter of fiscal which severely impacted our annual results 
however  our average quarterly sales of systems to commercial customers in the second through fourth quarters was higher than our first quarter sales to commercial customers 
the first quarter weakness in systems sales was due primarily to customer driven shipping and installation schedules on some of our larger orders received in the first quarter 
these orders were recorded as revenues upon shipment primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters 
sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to the prior year and were consistent with our expectations for this portion of our business in services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this increase consisted of an increase in recurring revenues partially offset by a decrease in installation revenues 
recurring revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m relationships with commercial customers represented the fastest growing part of our business in fiscal as these revenues grew by compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to the nortel product line and represented our initial success in developing our strategies to sell nortel services 
our recurring revenues earned from hospitality customers grew modestly in fiscal  also reflecting penetration into the nortel market 
we experienced a slight decline in revenues earned from contracts to maintain our proprietary call accounting systems as some customers declined to renew service contracts for this product  reflecting the impact of cell phones and internet communications on the usage of hotel provided phone transmission 
our installation revenues declined substantially in fiscal as these revenues returned to their historical dependence on systems sales 
in fiscal  we received a large installation only contract from the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which positively skewed our installation revenues 
we did not receive a similar contract in fiscal which resulted in a decline in these revenues and a negative impact to the overall gross margins earned on our services revenues 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in other revenues was attributable to declines in sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts and in sales of equipment made outside our normal provisioning processes 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal and were consistent with our expectations for systems sales at that time 
the support payments we received from our relationships with manufacturers and vendors were relatively unchanged in fiscal from fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins consisted of improvements in the gross margins earned on recurring revenues that were more than offset by declines in the margins earned on installation revenues 
the gross margins earned on recurring revenues returned to their historical levels as the revenues earned from our nortel service initiatives grew sufficiently to absorb the investments we made in hiring and training of technical personnel in the nortel product line 
gross margins earned on installation revenues declined dramatically due to the decline in revenues as discussed above 
the gross margins earned on other revenues in fiscal reflected the cost of marketing and administering the program to sell avaya post warranty maintenance contracts and the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this decrease reflected decreases in both sales expenses and general and administrative expenses in over sales expense reductions consisted of decreased personnel costs due to reduced sales management expenses and lower consulting fees 
the reductions in general and administrative expenses were due to a decrease in legal expenses  lower depreciation expense  and increased reimbursements by manufacturers and distributors of market development and marketing costs 
interest and other income 
interest expense increased in fiscal by approximately  reflecting higher interest rates in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  last year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we collected  on a customer receivable that had previously been written off 
there was not a transaction of similar magnitude in fiscal tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this increase reflected reduced operating expenses as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition improved during fiscal as our working capital grew by to million and we generated million in cash flows from operations 
these cash flows included cash from earnings and non cash charges of million  a reduction in inventory of  increases in accounts payable of million  and increases in deferred tax liabilities of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and other changes in working capital items  which netted to an increase in cash of  we used these cash flows to reduce borrowings on our working capital line of credit by  reduce our mortgage balance through scheduled principal payments by  and to fund capital expenditures of million 
of these capital expenditures   was spent on our oracle implementation and approximately  was spent on capital equipment 
non cash charges included depreciation expense of  amortization expense of  stock based compensation expense of  and a provision for obsolete inventory of  at october  we had capitalized million on the oracle project 
we have segregated the cost of this asset into four classifications with estimated useful lives of three  five  seven and ten years 
in fiscal we began amortizing the cost of those portions of the system that were ready for use 
our operating results for fiscal years and include  and  respectively  in amortization expense related to the project 
at october  the balance on our working capital revolver was million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
we believe that this available capacity is sufficient for our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver is scheduled to mature on september   however we expect to renew it for another month period prior to its expiration 
at october   we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements except for a requirement to not exceed  in capital expenditures 
as discussed above  our capital expenditures were million in fiscal our bank has granted a waiver of this technical violation of the credit agreement and we consider our relationship with our bank to be good 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities 
the table below presents our contractual obligations at october  as well as payment obligations over the next five fiscal years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and therefore we adopted the statement in the first quarter of fiscal we have concluded a preliminary review of the impact of fin and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial standards  no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value to improve their financial reporting and mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas  companies may elect to use the fair value option at specified election dates on an instrument by instrument basis 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning on or before november   although early adoption is permitted 
the company expects to adopt the standard on november  and is currently evaluating the potential impact of any election to use the fair value option 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise considerable judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our judgments predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once actual events unfold 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from equipment sales based on shipment of the equipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables that we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal   and we are responsible for reviewing goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we conducted these impairment tests on august  for fiscal year and on november for each of the prior fiscal years 
in fiscal years and  we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
in order to make this assessment each year  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  was then compared to the book value of each of those units 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment  including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
the valuation consultant engaged to assist in this evaluation  also examines additional data regarding competitors and market valuations 
this examination also requires a great amount of subjectivity and assumptions 
based on the work performed  we determined that the fair value was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors  including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  in the past we have been a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate libor at october  plus to depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio or the bank s prime rate at october  less to also depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
