overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of fully human antibody based therapeutic products 
we believe that our ultimab technology platform enables us to rapidly create and develop such product candidates for a wide range of diseases  including cancer  inflammation  autoimmune disorders and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
medarex is committed to building value by developing a diverse pipeline of antibody products to address major unmet healthcare needs in the world 
currently  over antibody product candidates generated from our ultimab technology are in human clinical trials  or have had regulatory applications submitted for such trials 
eight of the most advanced product candidates in which medarex has an economic interest through co promotion profit sharing rights  royalties and or equity ownership are in phase clinical trials or the subject of regulatory applications for marketing authorization 
seven of these late stage product candidates were generated through the use of our ultimab technology 
in addition to the antibody candidates currently in phase trials  multiple product candidates in phase  phase and preclinical testing are being developed by medarex alone  by medarex jointly with our partners  or separately by our partners 
these partners include amgen  inc  bristol myers squibb company  centocor  inc  eli lilly and company  genmab a s  imclone systems incorporated  medimmune  inc and novartis pharma ag 
we believe that through the broad use of our ultimab technology  we are leveraging our efforts and our partners efforts to create  develop and potentially commercialize innovative treatments for a wide range of diseases 
information regarding the clinical status of third party antibody products is based on public information available as of the date hereof 
in addition to our ultimab technology  we have considerable experience in preclinical and clinical development as well as in manufacturing antibodies for clinical trials 
our existing manufacturing facility in annandale  new jersey currently has the capacity to undertake multiple antibody projects concurrently for clinical development purposes  meeting our near term production demands 
we have assembled a team of experienced scientific  production  clinical and regulatory personnel to facilitate the discovery and development of antibody based products for us and for certain of our partners 
a portion of our revenue is derived from licensing our fully human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of these license agreements typically include potential license fees and a series of potential milestone payments commencing upon the initiation of clinical trials and continuing through commercialization 
these payments may total million to million per product if the antibody receives approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  and equivalent foreign agencies 
in general  we are also entitled to receive royalties on product sales 
additional revenue may be earned from the sales to  and in some cases  the manufacturing of antibodies for  our partners  as well as from government grants 
our most significant costs on an annual basis are research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent those costs that support the advancement of our product pipeline and primarily consist of personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research and laboratory supplies  funding of outside research  license and technology access fees  expenses related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
we may be required to add personnel in the future and incur additional costs as we expand our business activities 
we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research  move forward with our product development and prepare to commercialize our product s 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds 
our operating expenses may also increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional potential product candidates are selected for clinical development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our products progress towards commercialization 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or other sources  we will incur substantial operating losses and may be required to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings or sales of stock of partners in which we have an equity ownership or delay  reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we receive payments from our customers and partners for the sale of antibodies  for licenses to our proprietary technology  for product development services and from the achievement of product development milestones 
these payments are generally non refundable and are reported as deferred revenue until they are recognizable as revenue 
we follow the following principles in recognizing revenue we receive research fees from the licensing of our proprietary technologies for research and development performed by our customers and partners 
revenue from these research fees is recognized generally on a straight line basis over the term of the respective license period beginning only after both the license period has begun and the technology has been delivered 
we receive fees for product development services including manufacturing we perform for our customers and partners 
these fees are recognized ratably over the entire period during which the services are performed 
revenue from milestone payments is recognized when each milestone is achieved  when collectibility of such milestone payment is assured and we have no future performance obligations relating to that event 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by the efforts of our partners and include such events as submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  commencement of phase  or clinical trials  submission of a biologic license application  or bla  and regulatory approval of a product 
milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of an agreement 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
revenues derived from reimbursements of costs associated with the development of product candidates are recorded in compliance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf according to the criteria established by eitf  in transactions where we act as a principal  with discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform part of the services required in the transaction  we believe we have met the criteria to record revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursements 
we sell antibodies primarily to partners in the united states and overseas 
revenue from these sales is recognized when the antibodies are shipped and we have no further obligations related to the development of the antibodies 
grant revenues are recognized as we provide the services stipulated in the underlying grant based on the time and materials incurred 
amounts received in advance of services provided are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as revenue when the services are provided 
investments our investment policy calls for investments in fixed income high grade securities such as us corporate debt securities  us treasury obligations and money market funds for which we believe there is not a significant risk of loss 
our primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return consistent with these two objectives 
however  in the course of our business  we have made and may continue to make investments in companies both public and private as part of our strategic collaborations 
investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded other than genmab are classified as marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of investments in our partners whose securities are publicly traded other than genmab represented approximately of total marketable securities as of december  and approximately of total marketable securities as of december  under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
marketable securities will include those securities of debt and publicly traded equity securities accounted for under the fair value method 
these securities trade on listed exchanges  therefore  fair value is readily available 
these securities are also subject to an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
under our accounting policy  a decline in the value of our investments is deemed to be other than temporary and such investments are generally considered to be impaired if their value is less than our cost basis for more than six months  or some other applicable period in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investments 
in addition  in connection with our collaborative partnering business  we sometimes make strategic investments in the securities of companies that are privately held 
investments in our partners whose equity is not publicly traded are classified in a separate line item in our consolidated balance sheet entitled investments in  and advances to  other partners and were million as of december  these securities are carried at original investment cost and adjusted for other than temporary impairment charges  if any 
because these securities are not listed on a financial exchange  the value of these investments is inherently more difficult to estimate than investments in public companies 
we value these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  management of these companies  financial statements  and other external sources 
specifically  our determination of any potential impairment of the value of privately held securities includes an analysis of the following for each company on a periodic basis review of interim and year end financial statements  cash position and overall rate of cash used to support operations  the progress and development of technology and product platform  the per share value of subsequent financings and potential strategic alternatives 
based on the information acquired through these sources  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse changes in financial condition and or operating results of the companies in which we invest that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value may also require an impairment charge in the future 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for our equity incentive plan  or the plan  as amended  under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or statement no 
compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for all stock option grants under the plan that had an exercise price which was less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
however  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for all stock options grants with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  or statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a prospective basis for i all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement no 
 and ii share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
r 
the grant date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the related awards 
under the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing method 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period generally years 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
in order to estimate the grant date fair value  option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to i the expected term of the option  ii the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock  iii the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option and iv pre vesting forfeiture rates 
the expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term  taking into account expected employee exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior 
the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed on the date of grant 
pre vesting forfeiture rates are estimated based on past voluntary termination behavior  as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the following table sets forth the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended december   and expected dividend yield expected volatility weighted average expected volatility risk free interest rates expected life of options years our results of operations for the year ended december  include incremental share based compensation expense of approximately million 
as of december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options was approximately million 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
however  any significant awards granted during any year  required changes in the estimated forfeiture rates or significant changes in the market price of our stock could have an impact on this estimate 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets or of intangible assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
acquired in process technology in process technology expense for significant technology acquisitions is determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by products that may result from in process technologies which have been acquired 
this analysis includes forecasting future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on each in process project prior to the acquisition date 
cash flows are estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusting these revenues to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by us in the ordinary course of business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process technology are based on assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from forecasted net revenues on a product by product basis to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and us as well as product specific risks associated with the acquired in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  type of product candidate under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  a discount rate is used for the valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the valuations used to estimate in process technology require us to use significant estimates and assumptions that if changed  may result in a different valuation for in process technology 
loss contingencies and litigation reserves we assess potential losses in relation to legal proceedings and other pending or threatened legal or tax matters based upon the application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
if a loss is considered possible and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we disclose such loss if material 
litigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss or the amount thereof requires the exercise of considerable judgment  which is applied as of a certain date 
required reserves and estimates may change in the future due to new matters  developments in existing matters or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to any particular matter 
results of operations years ended december   and contract and license revenues contract and license revenues totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract and license revenues for increased by million or as compared to this increase relates principally to million in milestone payments received from our contract and licensing business 
contract and license revenues for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease relates principally to million in milestone payments received from our contract and licensing business in for which no comparable payments were received in because contract and license revenues depend to a large extent on the product development efforts of our partners and licensees  our year to year contract and license revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
contract and license revenues from genmab contract and license revenues from genmab were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract and license revenues from genmab for increased by million or as compared to this increase is primarily the result of an increase in research license extensions granted to genmab in as compared to contract and license revenues from genmab for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in antibody exclusive licenses granted to genmab in as compared to reimbursement of development costs revenues derived from the reimbursement of costs associated with the development of our product candidates are recorded in compliance with eitf issue reimbursement of development costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and related primarily to the development of ipilimumab with bristol myers squibb company  or bms 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to  and research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to historically  we have not accounted for our research and development expenses on a project by project basis and therefore  we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we track our costs in the categories discussed below  namely  research and product development and by the types of costs as outlined below 
our research costs consist of costs associated with the breeding  care and continued development of the humab mouse and km mouse  as well as costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the preclinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research supplies  funding of outside research and license and technology access fees 
our product development costs consist of costs of preclinical development including manufacturing and conducting and administering clinical trials including manufacturing 
such product development costs also include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  supply expense related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
year ended december  research    product development    total    research costs research costs in decreased by million  or as compared to research costs in increased by million  or as compared to the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to approximately million of the increase is the result of the adoption of statement no 
r  effective january  in addition  the increased personnel costs are attributable to staff needed to support higher levels of new product development opportunities  the continued development of our ultimab system  and the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
personnel costs include primarily salary  benefits  payroll taxes  stock option compensation and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we continue to increase our research activities 
license and technology access fees in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to license and technology access fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to increases and decreases in license and technology access fees are primarily the result of the timing of such agreements 
these costs represent fees paid to certain partners and research organizations in connection with certain of our collaboration and license agreements 
included in the costs for  and are payments to certain companies and research and academic institutions and other entities for licenses to certain technologies for which there are no comparable payments 
we expect license fees  including funds paid to certain partners  to increase in the future 
supply costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to supply costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increased supply costs in are primarily attributable to the continued development of our ultimab system  and the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
included in these costs are materials  chemicals and disposables 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our research efforts 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our research facilities in recent years 
as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for  as compared to  and for  as compared to we expect to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements 
product development costs product development costs in increased by million  or as compared to product development costs in increased by million  or as compared to the increases in product development costs primarily relate to the following contract manufacturing costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to contract manufacturing costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to the decrease in third party contract manufacturing costs in and primarily represents a decrease in production and packaging expenses for a phase pivotal trial of ipilimumab in combination with mdx  which began in the third quarter of and was transferred to bms in the second half of we expect costs to third party manufacturers will increase in the future in order to support the advancement of our clinical pipeline 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to approximately million of the increase is the result of the adoption of statement no 
r  effective january  the increased personnel costs are a result of the increased staff needed to support more extensive clinical trial activities primarily for ipilimumab 
personnel costs primarily include salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase as we continue to increase our product development activities and progress our product candidates through clinical trials 
clinical research fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to clinical research fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase resulted primarily from the continuing ipilimumab phase trial 
the increase resulted primarily from the continuing mdx phase trial 
clinical research fees include clinical investigator site fees  external trial monitoring costs and data accumulation costs 
we expect expenses related to clinical trials to increase in the future as we continue to develop our therapeutic product pipeline 
reimbursement of our share of the bms costs for the development of ipilimumab in were million  an increase of million or as compared to reimbursement of our share of the bms costs for the development of ipilimumab were million  an increase of million or as compared to we expect our share of bms s costs related to the development of ipilimumab to increase in the future as bms continues to increase its development activities related to ipilimumab 
we expect product development costs to increase in the future as more of our product candidates enter clinical trials 
in addition  we may be obligated to make milestone payments on certain of our product candidates as they progress through the clinical trial process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and intended use of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient dosing and follow up in light of trial results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
we continue to explore new collaborative arrangements that may affect future spending for research and development 
as part of our partnering strategy  a significant portion of the research and development expenses incurred in connection with products using our technology is expected to be borne by our partners 
we believe this allows us to participate in the research and development of substantially more potential product candidates than we could develop on our own if we bore the entire cost of development 
products using our technology are currently in various stages of development from preclinical to phase the successful development of these product candidates is dependent on many factors  including among other things  the efforts of our partners  unforeseen delays in  or expenditures relating to  preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing or regulatory approval  failure to receive regulatory approval  failure to receive market acceptance  the emergence of competitive products and the inability to produce or market our products due to third party proprietary rights 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting  travel and facilities including depreciation and other expenses related to legal  business development  finance  information systems and investor relations 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million in  or as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to lower legal fees associated with the company s investigation of its prior stock option grant practices 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in  or as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the following  i approximately million in legal fees associated with the company s investigation of its prior stock option grant practices  ii approximately million attributable to the operations of celldex therapeutics  inc  or celldex  iii approximately million is the result of the adoption of statement no 
r  effective january  and iv approximately million in non cash stock based compensation expense associated with one of our officers stepping down in november general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as our product candidates are developed and we expand our business activities 
acquisition of in process technology acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december  represented the final payment due under the original share purchase agreement with the former shareholders of ability biomedical corporation  or ability biomedical 
the million was classified as in process research and development 
the in process research and development was determined not to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future use  and  as a result was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology during acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december  related to acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of lorantis limited  or lorantis  a privately held biotechnology company based in cambridge  uk and the acquisition of substantially all assets of alteris therapeutics  inc  or alteris  a privately held biotechnology company based in philadelphia  pa  in each case by celldex 
these acquisitions were completed in october the total cost of these acquisitions including transaction costs was million  of which approximately million based upon independent third party valuations of in process research and development was determined not to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future uses at the time of the respective acquisitions  and  as a result  was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology during equity in net loss of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents our share of genmab s net loss for the years ended december  and genmab is an affiliated company and during these periods was accounted for using the equity method of accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of our share of genmab s net losses reduces the carrying value  or basis  of our investment in genmab 
equity in net loss of affiliate was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
equity in net loss of affiliate in decreased by million  or as compared to the decrease was primarily related to the suspension of our share of genmab s net losses effective february  on february   genmab completed the private placement of million shares of its stock 
as a result of this private placement  our ownership percentage of genmab was reduced to approximately 
beginning february  we began accounting for its investment in genmab as a marketable security in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in february  we sold  shares of genmab thereby reducing our ownership percentage to approximately 
in february  we sold an additional  shares of genmab further reducing our ownership percentage to approximately 
see further discussion under other liquidity matters 
in august  genmab sold approximately million shares of its stock to a corporate partner in connection with a global development and commercialization agreement 
as a result of this sale of stock  our ownership percentage in genmab was reduced from approximately to approximately 
the difference between our proportionate share of the equity and our carrying value after completion of genmab s sale of stock to the corporate partner was approximately million and was accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investment in common stock and staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for sales of stock by a subsidiary increasing our investment in genmab and capital in excess of par value 
interest  dividend income and realized gains interest  dividend income and realized gains consists primarily of interest earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest  dividend income and realized gains was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest  dividend income and realized gains in increased by million  or as compared to the increase reflects a combination of higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio as well as higher average cash balances reflecting the proceeds received approximately million from our february sale of approximately million shares of genmab stock 
interest  dividend income and realized gains in increased by million  or as compared to the increase primarily reflects higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
in addition  we have higher interest and dividend income in as the result of higher average cash balances reflecting the proceeds received approximately million from our april public offering of million shares of common stock see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
gain on sale of genmab stock in february  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of genmab stock resulting in a realized gain of approximately million as our cost basis for these shares was zero 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
the sale of the approximately million shares of genmab shares reduced our equity ownership in genmab to approximately 
impairment loss on investments in partners we recorded impairment charges of  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to investments in certain of our partners other than genmab whose securities are publicly traded 
the impairment charge was the result of losses on one of our investments which were considered to be other than temporary 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
in addition  we have investments in several partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
because these securities are not publicly traded  the value of these investments is more difficult to estimate than investments in publicly traded companies 
we recorded impairment charges of million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to investments in certain of our partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
approximately million of the impairment charge related to our investment in idm prior to its business combination with epimmune  inc the amount of the idm impairment charge was calculated as the difference between i the estimated per share value expected to be received by idm shareholders upon completion of its merger with epimmune  publicly announced on march   and ii our carrying value 
this transaction closed in the third quarter of and our investment in idm was reclassified to marketable securities 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
interest expense interest expense was primarily related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible senior notes issued in may  or the notes 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million or  as compared to reflects the amortization of additional debt discount associated with an increase in the fair value of the embedded conversion option of the notes which occurred in the fourth quarter of interest expense in increased by million  or  as compared to interest expense in  and relates to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our notes 
the notes are due in may and interest is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
minority interest celldex minority interest in loss of celldex was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
minority interest in loss of celldex represents of celldex s net loss for approximately nine months of  and for the period from october  through december  for the final three months of  minority interest represents of celldex s net loss 
during october  the minority interest in the equity of celldex was reduced to zero and accordingly  we as the majority shareholder are required to record of celldex s losses 
prior to october  we owned of the outstanding capital stock of celldex 
as a result of certain acquisitions by celldex see note to the consolidated financial statements our ownership percentage was reduced from to approximately 
celldex s results of operations for  and have been consolidated for reporting purposes and the million  million and million the portion of celldex s net loss for and the period from october  through december  not attributable to us is recorded as a reduction of our expenses 
non cash gain on investment in genmab non cash gain on investment in genmab for of million was recorded in accordance with fasb staff position apb  accounting by an investor for its proportionate share of accumulated other comprehensive income of an investee accounted for under the equity method in accordance with apb opinion no 
upon a loss of significant influence fsp apb 
as a result of genmab s private placement of million shares of its common stock in february and the corresponding reduction of our ownership percentage below  our accumulated other comprehensive income associated with our investment in genmab was first offset against the remaining carrying value of our investment in genmab million  reducing our investment in genmab to zero  with the remaining balance million recorded as a non cash gain in the consolidated statement of operations for provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes of thousand  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  relates primarily to the new jersey alternative minimum tax assessment 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operations  to make capital expenditures and strategic investments  and to pay debt service on our convertible notes 
since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of our securities in public and private placements  sales of our products for research purposes  development and manufacturing services  technology transfer and license fees and milestone payments 
we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these sources in the future 
in   and  we received combined net proceeds of million from sales of our equity and debt securities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities other than genmab 
approximately million and million of cash and cash equivalents included in the december  and balance sheets relates to celldex and is consolidated for accounting purposes 
we primarily invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities to preserve principal 
in addition  as of december   the fair value of our investment in genmab  which is classified as marketable securities was approximately million 
in february  we completed the sale of  shares of genmab through a block trade 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from such block trade 
as a result of this transaction our ownership percentage in genmab was reduced to approximately 
cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this reflects an increase of million in as compared to and an increase of million in as compared to cash used in operating activities was comparable in and the increase was primarily due to increased research and development expenses million and increased general and administrative expenses million as a result of the factors discussed above 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our products are developed 
we plan to spend significant amounts to progress our current products through clinical trials and the commercialization process as well as to develop additional product candidates on our own or with our partners 
as our products progress through the clinical trial process  we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments on certain of our products 
we also expect to incur future facility costs as a result of our continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements 
to a lesser extent  we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we expand our administrative and business development activities 
furthermore  we expect our investment income to decrease as we fund our future operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves 
we anticipate that our operating expenditures may be partially offset by revenues from partners for license fees  milestone payments  and development and manufacturing services 
cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in and million in net cash used in investing activities was million in cash was provided by and used in investing activities primarily as follows capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures for these periods reflect an investment in laboratory automation as well as the addition of machinery and equipment 
net sales of marketable securities were million in the net sales of marketable securities in were primarily to fund operations and capital expenditures offset in part  by the proceeds received from the bms collaboration million 
net purchases of marketable securities were million and million in and  respectively 
the net purchases were the result of the proceeds received from the february sale of million shares of our genmab stock see further discussion below 
the net purchases were the result of proceeds received from our april public offering see further discussion below 
net cash of approximately million in provided through the acquisition of lorantis by celldex see further explanation in the section entitled other liquidity matters 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million representing the purchase of machinery and scientific equipment and continued investment in lab automation 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of approximately million in net proceeds received from our april public offering see further discussion below 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds received million from the sale of common stock to bms in connection with our collaboration 
in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
in may  the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase an additional million shares of common stock at the public offering price of per share 
the exercise of the option to purchase the additional million shares increased the size of the public offering to a total of million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in january  we completed the provisional redemption of all of our notes which was previously announced in december holders of all of the outstanding notes million converted their notes into a total of  shares of our common stock prior to the redemption date 
in connection with the redemption  we paid approximately million in cash representing the make whole payment of million and accrued interest of million 
other liquidity matters as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
these nol carryforwards will expire in the years as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  if not utilized 
we determined that an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurred during the effect of this ownership change was the imposition of a million annual limitation on the use of nol carryforwards attributable to periods before the change 
this annual limitation will result in the expiration of some nol carryforwards before they become available for utilization 
at december  the amount of nol subject to the limitation was million and the amount not subject to limitation was million 
we have not performed a detailed analysis since to determine whether an additional ownership change under section has occurred 
the effect of an additional ownership change if any would be the imposition of an additional annual limitation on the use of nol carrryforwards attributable to periods before the change 
in august  we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock not already owned by us of ability biomedical 
pursuant to this transaction  we acquired ability biomedical s intellectual property related to ip  a protein believed to be associated with a variety of immune disorders  including multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel disease  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type i diabetes 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement with ability biomedical  we made cash payments totaling approximately thousand and issued a total of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million in exchange for all of ability biomedical s issued and outstanding stock not already owned by us 
in august  we agreed to pay the former shareholders of ability biomedical million  representing the final payment due under the original share purchase agreement 
a payment of million was made to the former shareholders of ability biomedical in august and a final payment of million was made on november  in september  we entered into a series of agreements with pfizer 
the first agreement amended our existing collaborative research and license and royalty agreements with pfizer to provide for the discovery and development of up to antibody products over ten years 
the second and third agreements were a sublicense from us to pfizer and a cross license of certain patents and patent applications  in each case solely relating to our respective anti ctla antibody programs 
the fourth agreement was a stock purchase agreement also related to the anti ctla programs 
pursuant to certain of these agreements  pfizer made a cash payment to us of million and purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in january  we entered into a collaboration and co promotion agreement and a related securities purchase agreement with bms 
under the terms of the collaboration  we and bms each granted the other certain intellectual property licenses and product rights on a worldwide basis in order to enable us to collaborate in research and development of certain therapeutic antibody based products for the treatment of cancer and other diseases  and  in the event that further development work is successful  to commercialize any resulting products 
in particular  the collaboration includes a grant by us to bms of a license to commercialize ipilimumab  a fully human antibody product candidate developed using our ultimab technology 
ipilimumab is currently under investigation for the treatment of a broad range of cancers 
we and bms are pursuing a broad clinical development program with ipilimumab to evaluate its potential use as monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies in multiple registrational phase trials that are ongoing or being planned for melanoma and prostate cancer  and in ongoing phase or earlier trials in lung  pancreatic  bladder  breast  lymphoma and leukemia cancers 
as part of the collaboration  bms is responsible for of all development costs related to clinical trials intended to support regulatory approval in both the us and europe  with the remaining to be paid by us 
we and bms will share equally the costs of any clinical trials of products intended solely for regulatory approval in the us  and bms will be fully responsible for all development costs that relate solely to regulatory approval in europe and other parts of the world 
under the terms of the collaboration  we have the option to co promote any product in the us if we exercise a co promotion option with respect to a product for use in the first cancer indication for which an initial regulatory approval filing is accepted by the fda  we will have the right and obligation to co promote such product for use in all cancer indications  even if such indications are the subject of additional filings or approvals  and even if we opted out of the development of any such indication 
even if we elect to co promote a product for cancer indications  however  we would need to exercise a separate option to co promote that product with respect to any indication other than cancer 
if we do not exercise our co promotion option with respect to a product for use in the first cancer indication for which an initial regulatory approval filing is accepted by the fda  then we will not have the right or obligation to co promote such product for any cancer indications  unless the filing for that first cancer indication is not approved by fda 
under the terms of the collaboration  we could receive up to million from bms if all regulatory milestones are met  plus up to an additional million in sales related milestones 
in addition  if we exercise our co promotion option with respect to ipilimumab for the metastatic melanoma indication  and regulatory approval is obtained  we would receive of any profits from commercial sales of such product in the us in the event we choose not to exercise our co promotion rights with respect to a product  bms will have exclusive commercial rights in the us and will pay us royalties on commercial sales 
regardless of whether or not we exercise our co promotion option outside the us  bms will have exclusive commercial rights for products and will pay us royalties on commercial sales 
pursuant to these agreements  bms made a cash payment to us on january  of million and also purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price equal to per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in october  celldex completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of lorantis and substantially all of the assets of alteris 
the purchase price of lorantis consisted of million shares of celldex class a common stock valued at million 
the purchase price for substantially all of the alteris assets consisted of million shares of celldex common stock valued at million and approximately million in cash 
celldex may be required to pay alteris up to million upon obtaining the first approval for commercial sale of an egfrviii product 
in may  we sold million in aggregate principal amount of our notes to qualified institutional investors 
the notes are initially convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares per each  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
interest is payable on may and november of each year 
the first interest payment was made on november  the notes mature on may  and are redeemable at our option on or after may  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control as defined in the indenture 
we received net proceeds from the offering of the notes of approximately million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses 
the costs of issuance of the notes of approximately million have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
in may  or earlier if we undergo a change in control  we may be required to use a significant portion of our cash to repay the remaining balance million of the notes 
if our cash is not sufficient to meet our obligations under the notes  we would be required to seek additional financing 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations under lease  debt and research funding agreements for the next five years  and thereafter  as of december   are as follows payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands contractual obligations convertible notes     research and development funding  operating leases and other    total contractual cash obligations    this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities  and d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date and  therefore  may not require the use of our capital resources 
research and development funding for less than year includes up to million that we anticipate may be used under our collaboration agreement with bms to fund our share of the expected costs of the development of ipilimumab during this amount represents our costs  net of reimbursement of from our partner bms  as well as our share of the bms development costs during the amounts that we actually spend during for the development of ipilimumab may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including the outcome of our meetings with regulatory authorities  results from current and future clinical trials  the continued analysis of the clinical trial data for ipilimumab  actions taken by our partner bms under the collaboration agreement and technological developments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
financial uncertainties related to potential future milestone payments in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with kirin  which cross licenses certain of each other s technologies for the development and commercialization of human antibody products 
under the collaboration and license agreement  we and kirin developed the km mouse  a unique crossbred mouse that combines the traits of our humab mouse with kirin s tc mouse and exchanged cross licenses with respect to the km mouse and other antibody generating mice 
in addition  certain of the cross licenses granted under the collaboration and license agreement are subject to license  milestone and royalty payments by one party to the other 
through december   we have not made any milestone payments to kirin although approximately million has been paid to kirin as of december  representing a payment due kirin as a result of our collaboration with pfizer 
based on products we are developing which use or  we believe may use  kirin technology that i are currently in clinical trials  or ii we anticipate may enter clinical trials through the end of  we may be required to make milestone payments to kirin aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products 
our future milestone payment obligations to kirin may or may not be triggered  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently unknown  including the following whether or not a decision is made to request a license from kirin  the type of license requested research or commercial  the success and timing of development efforts and clinical trials of product candidates covered by any such licenses  the type of product developed payment obligations differ depending on whether a product is an ex vivo therapeutic  in vivo therapeutic  research reagent or diagnostic  and other financial provisions of the kirin agreement that provide for variations in fee levels and netting of certain payments over specified periods of time that may impact the total amount potentially payable to kirin for any particular license fee or milestone payment 
we have also entered into a number of other agreements that contain licenses of third party technology which may be used together with our own platform technologies for the generation  development and or manufacture of our antibody products 
in addition  we have entered into other third party agreements that contain licenses associated with antibody products that target specific antigens 
many of these agreements contain milestone payments that are due with respect to products using targeting the licensed technology antigen only if and when certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
not all of our products currently under development trigger such milestone payments 
through december   we have made milestone payments of approximately million under these agreements 
in addition  under the agreements we currently have in place other than with kirin  based on a total of products we are developing for which milestones are potentially due and that i are now in clinical trials  or ii which we anticipate may enter clinical trials before the end of  we may be obligated to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products 
in general  potential milestone payments for our antibody products may or may not be triggered under these licenses  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently uncertain 
typically  the events that trigger these payments per product include submission of ind s or foreign equivalents  commencement of phase  phase and or phase clinical trials or foreign equivalents  submission of bla s or foreign equivalents  and receipt of marketing approval s to sell products in a particular country or region 
in addition  the licenses above may trigger royalty payments in connection with the commercialization of certain of our products 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are at least a year away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
future liquidity resources our current sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest and dividends earned on such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  contract and licensing revenue and sales of our products for research 
we believe that such sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operating  debt service  and capital requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent our notes are converted into shares of our common stock on or before their maturity date  we will have use of that portion of the principal amount of the notes to fund our on going operations 
in any event  we may require additional financing within this time frame and may raise funds through public or private financings  sales of stock of partners in which we have an equity ownership  line of credit arrangements  collaborative relationships and or other methods 
the use of cash on hand or other financial alternatives will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the future success of our products in clinical development  the prevailing interest rate environment  and access to the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise such additional funds 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to complete development of any of our product candidates or to continue operations 
as a result  we may face delay  reduction or elimination of research and development programs or preclinical or clinical trials  in which case our business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially harmed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and the terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf  however we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations statement no

 business combinations  and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
statement no 
r also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the non controlling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
statement no 
r makes various other amendments to authoritative literature intended to provide additional guidance or conform the guidance in that literature to that provided in statement no 
r 
statement no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect that the adoption of statement no 
r will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements statement no 
 which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries not held by the parent to be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
statement no 
also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest must be accounted for consistently  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value 
the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non controlling equity investment 
statement no 
also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
statement no 
applies prospectively to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements and applies prospectively for all fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on for after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of statement no 
 however we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
eitf is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf  however we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 

statement no 
permits entities to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in the fair values of those items unrealized gains and losses recognized in the statement of income for each reporting period 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under statement no 
 fair value elections can be made on an instrument by instrument basis  are irrevocable  and can only be made upon specified election date events 
in addition  new disclosure requirements apply with respect to instruments for which fair value measurement is elected 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of statement no will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  statement no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of statement no 
 however  we do not believe that its adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates  however  we may experience reinvestment risk as fixed income securities mature and are reinvested in securities bearing lower interest rates 
the recent and precipitous decline in the market value of certain securities backed by residential mortgage loans has led to a large liquidity crisis affecting the broader u 
s housing market  the financial services industry and global financial markets 
investors holding many of these and related securities have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain secondary market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
as a result  this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or possibly require impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline in value which is determined to be other than temporary 
we currently do not believe that any change in the market value of fixed income investments in our portfolio to be material or warrant a determination that there was an other than temporary impairment 
we may be exposed to exchange conversion differences in translating the value of our investment in genmab to us dollars 
depending upon the relative strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  the conversion difference could be significant
