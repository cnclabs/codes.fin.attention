item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research  analysis  executive education and leadership development  decision support tools and installation support services historically focused across the heath care industry where we serve a membership of more than  organizations  including leading hospitals  health systems  pharmaceutical and biotech companies  health care insurers  medical device companies and universities 
best practice research identifies  analyzes and describes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
members of each program typically are charged a fixed annual fee and have access to an integrated set of services that may include best practice research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs  decision support tools and web based access to the program s content database 
our membership business model allows us to focus on a broad set of issues relevant to our member organizations  while promoting frequent use of our programs and services by our members 
our growth has been driven by strong renewal rates  ongoing addition of new memberships in our existing programs  continued annual price increases and the continued success of our new program launches 
our member institution renewal rate in each of the past three years was  and for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we view this metric as one of the most important in terms of the overall health of our business and it illustrates that our programs are consistently addressing our members most important strategic and operational issues 
our revenue grew in fiscal over fiscal and grew in fiscal over fiscal  and we increased our contract value by at march  over march  and by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
memberships in of our programs are renewable at the end of their membership contract term  which is typically one year 
our other eight best practices programs provide installation support 
these program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
as of march   more than of our contract value was generated from renewable programs 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenue following introduction of the program because revenue associated with the new program is recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are generally expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost for us to serve an additional member is low 
our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the cost of depreciation of our property and equipment and includes amortization of costs associated with the development of decision support software and tools that are offered as part of certain of our membership programs 
included in our operating costs for each year presented are equity related expenses representing additional payroll taxes for compensation expense as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options 
share based compensation expense related to our adoption of fas r is included in our operating costs for fiscal and results of operations the following table shows statements of income data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated and a second table shows the stock based compensation expense included in the statements of income data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increases in net income were primarily due to profitable growth as revenue for the periods increased more than per year allowing us to leverage our existing costs over our expanding membership base and to invest in new program launches 
we successfully introduced four  three and five new membership and installation support programs in fiscal  and  respectively 
because of the company s adoption of fas r on april   stock based compensation expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  but was less than  in fiscal revenue 
total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our contract value increased from million for the fiscal year ended march  to million for the fiscal year ended march   and increased from million for the fiscal year ended march  to million for the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal year  we began entering into more multi year contracts in some of our programs which has the effect of spreading revenue over a longer service period and also reducing contract value 
the increases in revenue and contract value were primarily due to cross selling existing programs to existing members  the introduction and expansion of new programs price increase  and  to a lesser degree  the addition of new member organizations 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march  and as of march  our membership base consisted of  member institutions as of march    member institutions as of march   and  member institutions as of march  our average contract value per member increased from  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal and to  for fiscal cost of services 
cost of services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the total dollar increase in cost of services was primarily due to increased personnel costs from the introduction of new programs during the fiscal year  full year program costs for programs launched during the prior fiscal year  including staffing  travel  deliverable and meetings costs  and costs associated with the delivery of program content and tools to our expanded membership base  including increased staffing  licensing and other costs 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of services was million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of services was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a shift in timing of new product staffing costs between the first quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the earlier launch of new programs 
the increases in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal were due to an increased investment in new programs containing web based decision support tools and applications which require more upfront resources before launch  the strong performance of three of our programs in which we pay a variable licensing fee to a third party  and the adoption of fas r 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of services totaled of revenue in fiscal and of revenue in fiscal we expect cost of services as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate from year to year  depending on the number of members in our largely fixed cost programs  investments in new programs and services and the number of new programs launched as up front costs are expensed when incurred compared to revenue which is spread over the membership period 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  member relations and marketing expense in fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
the total dollar increase in member relations and marketing expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related travel and other associated costs  as we had  and new business development teams as of march   and  respectively  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs required to serve the expanding membership base 
share based compensation expense included in member relations and marketing was million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to stock based compensation expense  the increases in general and administrative expense from fiscal to fiscal were primarily due to increased staffing in our recruiting  benefits and training departments required to support our overall headcount growth 
these expenses did not increase at the same rate as revenue  as we were able to leverage our general and administrative spend over a larger revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenue  in fiscal this increase in depreciation expense is primarily due to the amortization of expenses related to the expansion of additional floors in our headquarters facility under the terms of our lease agreement  as well as increased amortization expense of capitalized internal use software tools developed for some of our newer membership programs that include decision support tools that are accessed via the internet 
interest income 
interest income increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and decreased to million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was principally from a higher rate of return on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to increased utilization of our share repurchase program during fiscal  which resulted in lower cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal includes a non cash income tax charge to earnings of million associated with our change in effective status as a qhtc described below 
our effective tax rate in fiscal  and was  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal due to our certification as a qhtc  and further decreased in due to a reduction in non deductible stock based compensation expense related to incentive stock option exercises and other permanent differences 
in february  we received notification from the office of tax and revenue of the district of columbia that we had been certified  effective january   as a qhtc under the new e conomy transformation act of  as amended 
this certification had the effect of reducing our washington  dc statutory income tax rate to through december  and thereafter  compared to per year without the qualification 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge to write down our washington  dc net operating loss carry forward deferred tax asset 
excluding the non cash charge our income tax rate for fiscal was 
we are also eligible for certain washington  dc income tax credits and other benefits 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognized stock based compensation expense in the following statements of income line items for stock options and restricted stock units issued under our stock incentive plans and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan according to apb for the year ended march  and according to fas r for the years ended march  and as follows in thousands except per share amounts year ended march  stock based compensation expense included in costs and expenses cost of services member relations and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations net income impact on diluted earnings per share in addition  we recognized approximately   and  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
there is no stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of the cost of an asset 
stock based compensation expense by award type is below in thousands year ended march  stock based compensation by award type stock options restricted stock units employee stock purchase rights total stock based compensation as of march   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock based compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows generated from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity and we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and operating cash flows will be sufficient to support operating and capital expenditures  as well as share repurchases and potential acquisitions  during the next months 
we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million and million at march  and  respectively 
we repurchased million and million shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program during the years ended march  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth  profitable operations and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal effective april   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
pursuant to fas r  benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized book compensation expense is reported as a financing cash inflow in the consolidated statement of cash flows in fiscal and prior to the adoption of fas r  we reported these tax benefits as an operating cash flow 
as a result  approximately million and million of excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options were recorded as cash from financing activities in fiscal and  respectively  whereas prior period results have not been restated 
cash flows from investing activities 
the company s cash management and investment strategy and capital expenditure programs affect investing cash flows 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash flows provided by investing activities were million in fiscal investing activities in fiscal used million of cash  primarily from the net purchases of marketable securities of million and the net cash acquisition of quality team associates  inc  which we refer to as optilink  of million 
capital expenditures included million for purchases of property and equipment and million of capitalized software development costs 
in fiscal  investing activities used million of cash  primarily from million of capital expenditures  consisting of million in purchases of property and equipment related primarily to the scheduled expansion of our headquarters facility and million of capitalized development costs related to our newer research programs that include web based decision support tools 
investing activities also included our final payment made for the acquisition of optilink of  these activities were offset by million in net proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities 
in fiscal  investing activities provided million in cash primarily from the net proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities of million as we increased utilization of our share repurchase program compared to prior years  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures included million in purchases of property and equipment related primarily to the scheduled expansion of our headquarters facility and million of capitalized software development costs related to our newer research programs that include web based decision support tools 
cash flows from financing activities 
we used net cash flows in financing activities of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options 
also in fiscal  and  we received approximately   and  respectively  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we repurchased   and  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  pursuant to our share repurchase program 
our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc the facilities accommodate research  delivery  marketing and sales  information technology  administration  graphic services and operations personnel 
we lease our office facilities  and the lease expires in june the terms of the lease contain provisions for rental escalation and we are required to pay our portion of executory costs such as taxes  insurance  and operating expenses 
we also lease small office spaces in portland  oregon and mountain view  california 
the oregon lease expires in june and the california lease expires in april we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and additional facilities are available for lease to meet any future needs 
contractual obligations 
in november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank that can be used for working capital  share repurchases or other general corporate purposes 
borrowings on the credit facility  if any  will be collateralized by certain of our marketable securities and will bear interest at an amount based on the published libor rate 
we are also required to maintain an interest coverage ratio for each of our fiscal years of not less than three to one 
the credit facility renews automatically each year until  and can be increased at our request by up to an additional million per year up to million in the aggregate 
there have been no borrowings under the credit facility 
the following summarizes our known contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations relate primarily to our headquarters office lease  which is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases off balance sheet arrangements at march   we had no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
share repurchase in january  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock  which authorization was increased in amount to million in october  to million in february  to million in january  to million in july   and to million in april all repurchases to date have been made in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions and trade restrictions 
no minimum number of shares has been fixed  and the share repurchase authorization has no expiration date 
the company funds the share repurchases with cash on hand and with cash generated from operations 
at march   the remaining authorized repurchase amount was million  which was subsequently increased to million in april by authorization of our board of directors 
exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan options granted to participants under our stock based incentive compensation plans that were exercised to acquire shares in fiscal  and generated cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in payment of option exercise prices 
in addition  in fiscal  and we generated cash of approximately   and  respectively  in discounted stock purchases from participants under our employee stock purchase plan 
we recognized approximately   and  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also incurred additional compensation deductions for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased the deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions 
these tax deductions will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as the deferred tax asset is utilized 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectability is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees  if earlier 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to the service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
revenue from renewable memberships and best practices installation support memberships is recognized ratably over the term of the related subscription agreement  which is generally months 
certain membership programs incorporate robust hosted decision support tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based decision support tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally one to three years 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a robust decision support tool  all program revenue is deferred until the tool is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 
one of our programs includes delivered software tools together with implementation services  technical support and related membership services 
revenue for these arrangements is recorded pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized as the implementation services are performed 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from its members has an effect on the company s operating performance and cash flows 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on its ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  the company examines its collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific customer collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions and current economic trends 
capitalized internal software development costs hosted software internal use in certain membership agreements  the company utilizes software decision support tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on the company s hardware 
the customers do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the decision support tools during the term of their membership agreement 
in accordance with eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware eitf  the development costs of this software are accounted for in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage  direct consulting costs  payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
delivered software 
one of our membership programs includes delivered software tools 
the associated capitalized software asset is accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize consulting costs  payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s goodwill and other intangible assets have been accounted for under the provisions of fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  upon completion of an acquisition  the purchase price is allocated to the intangibles which are separately identifiable from goodwill based on the asset s fair value 
the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
the company considers expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges direct incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data and software incorporated in specific memberships that include decision support tools and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and other federal and state income tax credits 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  fas does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates  including the estimated effects of the qhtc status on our washington  dc deferred tax assets 
we will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin on april  the impact of adoption was not material 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes 
we do not currently anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase within the next months 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the share based awards based on their fair values  and is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized by us beginning april  included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or after april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but that were unvested as of  april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under the provisions of fas r  the company calculates the grant date estimated fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the estimated fair value of share based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the share based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of the company s shares and forfeiture rates of the awards 
prior to adopting fas r  the company recognized forfeitures only as they occurred 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of rsus is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
in accordance with fas r  we also report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we reported these tax benefits as an operating cash flow 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material
