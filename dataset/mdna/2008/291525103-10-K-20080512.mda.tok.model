item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located primarily in the united states 
we also own and operate a television station in new orleans 
in the quarter ended august   we classified our television assets as held for sale see note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion 
the results of operations of our television division have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
radio stations ratings are measured principally four times a year by arbitron inc because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for each of the past three years 
all revenues generated by our international radio properties are included in the local category 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  political advertising and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national publication sales non traditional other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties domestic radio revenue growth has been anemic for several years 
management believes this is principally the result of four factors the emergence of new media  such as various media content distributed via the internet and cable interconnects  which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media  the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising  lack of confidence in the ratings of radio stations due to dated ratings gathering methods  and a lack of inventory and pricing discipline by radio operators 
the radio industry has begun several initiatives to address these issues  most notable of which is the rollout of hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together to coordinate the programming on secondary channels in each radio market to ensure a more diverse consumer offering and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we recently announced our participation in a joint venture with seven other member broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party will use to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigational devices 
we currently utilize hd radio digital technology on most of our fm stations 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 
arbitron inc  the supplier of ratings data for united states radio markets  has developed technology to passively collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require any active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service is scheduled to begin in new york  los angeles and chicago markets in the fall of it is unclear what impact the introduction of the ppm will have on ratings in the markets in which we operate 
our radio cluster in new york trailed the performance of its peers during the year ended february  for the year ended february   our new york radio stations revenues were down  whereas the independent accounting firm miller  kaplan  arase co  llp miller kaplan reported that net revenues of the new york market in total were down 
we believe we trailed the performance of our peers in new york principally due to deterioration in ratings early in our fiscal at wqht fm and wrxp fm formerly wqcd fm 
ratings for wqht fm improved steadily during fiscal on february   emmis announced the launch of wrxp fm  an adult oriented rock station 
emmis believes it will be able to capitalize on improved ratings at wqht fm and also believes that ratings at wrxp fm will steadily improve 
our radio cluster in los angeles also trailed the performance of its peers during the year ended february  for the year ended february   our los angeles radio stations revenues were down  whereas miller kaplan reported that net revenues of the los angeles market in total were down 
ratings at kpwr fm steadily improved during our fiscal  which allowed for kpwr fm to exceed the performance of its peers during the year 
however  kmvn fm has continued to struggle following its format change in august we invested additional resources in kmvn fm during fiscal  yet ratings for the station showed no material improvements during the year 
the performance at kmvn fm has been the principal factor in our los angeles cluster financial performance lagging the los angeles market 
in august  emmis made a strategic decision to divest all its television stations 
the decision to sell its television stations stemmed from the company s desire to reduce its debt  coupled with the company s view that its television stations needed to be aligned with a company with more significant financial resources and a singular focus on resolving american television challenges  including the growth of digital video recorders and the industry s relationship with cable and satellite providers 
as of february   emmis has sold of its television stations  receiving gross proceeds of approximately billion 
on may   emmis entered into an agreement to sell its remaining television station  wvue tv 
the transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macro economic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under sfas no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  or to the extent that market values decrease 
allocations for purchased assets we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   including amounts we have reclassified as held for sale  we have recorded approximately million in fcc licenses and goodwill  which represents of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense if the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
in fiscal  we recorded a noncash impairment loss of million for radio broadcasting licenses million related to our domestic radio fcc licenses and million related to our international broadcast licenses in belgium 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

these estimates are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize experts in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of our tax expense and related liabilities 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and february  the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation claims  automotive liability losses and media liability 
valuation of stock options the company determines the fair value of its employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different than 
table of contents these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the company relies heavily upon historical data for its stock price when determining expected volatility  but each year the company reassesses whether or not historical data is representative of expected results

whether these mandatory repayment provisions apply depends  in certain instances  on emmis total leverage ratio  as defined under the credit facility 
borrowing under the credit facility depends upon our continued compliance with certain operating covenants and financial ratios  including leverage and fixed charge coverage as specifically defined

no default or event of default has occurred or is continuing 
the credit facility provides that an event of default will occur if there is a change of control of emmis  as defined 
the payment of principal  premium and interest under the credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by ecc and most of its existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
substantially all of emmis assets  including the stock of emmis wholly owned  domestic subsidiaries  are pledged to secure the credit facility 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and cash available through revolving loan borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of capital have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  funding acquisitions and preferred stock dividend requirements 
we also have used  and may continue to use  capital to repurchase our common stock 
since we manage cash on a consolidated basis  any cash needs of a particular segment or operating entity are met by intercompany transactions 
see investing activities below for discussion of specific segment needs 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million 
approximately million and million of our cash and cash equivalents were held at european banking institutions as of february  and february   respectively 
the company has not repatriated these funds to date due to the taxes that would be due upon repatriation 
the decrease in net working capital relates to the sale of an additional television property in fiscal coupled with a decline in operating performance of our radio properties  particularly in new york and los angeles 
on may   emmis entered into an agreement to sell its remaining television station  wvue tv  for million in cash 
the transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar during the year ended february   emmis completed the sale of kgmb tv and kmtv tv for a combined million in cash 
emmis also collected million related to a real estate loan in honolulu 
emmis used a majority of the cash proceeds to repay outstanding debt obligations 

table of contents operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended february   as compared to the same period in the prior year  is principally due to an increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal after excluding the noncash impairment loss of million and the noncash contract termination fee of million  both incurred during the year ended february  in addition to the receipt of million of business interruption insurance proceeds  which is classified as net cash provided by operating activities discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flows provided by operating activities are historically the highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters  as a significant portion of our accounts receivable collections is derived from revenues recognized in our second and third fiscal quarters  which are our highest revenue quarters 
investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended february   compared to million in the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to cash received during the year ended february  from the sale of wkcf tv  kkfr fm and wrda fm  partially offset by our sale of kgmb tv during the year ended february  investing activities include capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
as discussed in results of operations above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have consummated numerous acquisitions and divestitures in the three years ended february  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as ancillary businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
conversely  as evidenced by the sale of our television stations  kkfr fm in phoenix  and wrda fm in st 
louis  we continually evaluate our portfolio and we will monetize assets when others see greater value in selected assets 
in the years ended february  and  we had capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to leasehold improvements to various office and studio facilities  broadcast equipment purchases  tower upgrades and costs associated with our conversion to hd radio technology 
we expect that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended february  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to i lower net debt repayments for the year ended february  as the company had closed on wkcf tv  kkfr fm and wrda fm and made related debt principal repayments in the prior year  ii a million special dividend paid to holders of class a common shares in november partially offset by open market class a common share repurchases totaling million during the year ended february  our debt service requirements over the next month period excluding interest under our credit facility and principal amounts of our senior subordinated notes are expected to be million 
this amount is comprised of million for repayment of term notes under our credit facility and million in preferred stock dividend requirements 
although interest will be paid under the credit facility at least every three months  the amount of interest is not presently determinable given that the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
the terms of emmis preferred stock provide for a quarterly dividend payment of per share on each january  april  july and october at may   we had million available under our credit facility  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
the company expects to continue to use its significant cash flows from operations to primarily repay outstanding debt obligations 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations and publishing properties  as well as ancillary businesses and businesses outside of radio and publishing that leverage our strengths 
if we elect to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities  we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in addition  emmis has the option  but not the obligation  to purchase our partner s entire interest in the austin radio partnership beginning in january based on an multiple of trailing month cash flow 
the option  which does not expire  has not been exercised 

table of contents intangibles including intangible assets classified as noncurrent assets discontinued operations  at february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  subscription lists and similar assets  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations and remaining television station  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
our foreign broadcasting licenses expire during periods ranging from november to may we will need to submit applications to extend our foreign licenses upon their expiration to continue our broadcast operations in these countries

the fsp prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities and requires the use of the direct expensing method  built in overhaul method  or deferral method 
the company adopted the fsp on march   and began using the deferral method to account for major maintenance activities related to its leased airplane 
under this method  actual costs of the major maintenance activities are capitalized as incurred and amortized to corporate expenses until the next overhaul date 
prior to the adoption of this standard  the company accrued for such overhaul costs in advance and recorded the charge to corporate expenses 
as a result of the adoption of the fsp  the company has eliminated the effect of the accrue in advance method on all previous periods

for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since a significant portion of our senior bank debt is comprised of variable rate debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of emmis due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
emmis is exposed to market risk from changes in domestic and international interest rates ie prime and libor and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage interest rate exposure  emmis periodically enters into interest rate derivative agreements 
emmis does not use financial instruments for trading and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
interest rates the credit facility requires emmis to maintain fixed interest rates  for at least a three year period beginning in may  on a minimum of of emmis total outstanding debt  as defined by the credit facility 
on march   emmis entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the underlying three month libor at

the notional amount of the additional interest rate swap agreement totaled million  and the agreement expires on march  the counterparties to these agreements are global financial institutions 
based on amounts outstanding at february   if the interest rate on our variable debt were to increase by  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million 
with the additional interest rate swap agreement discussed above  a increase would result in million of increased interest expense 
foreign currency emmis has subsidiaries in hungary  belgium  slovakia and bulgaria which are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements 
these subsidiaries operations are measured in local currencies forint  euro  koruna and leva  respectively 
emmis has a natural hedge against currency fluctuations between these currencies and the us dollar since most of the subsidiaries long term obligations are denominated in the respective local currency 
emmis management cannot predict the most likely average or end of period forint to dollar  euro to dollar  koruna to dollar  or leva to dollar exchange rates for calendar a devaluation of these foreign currencies could have a material effect on our financial statements taken as a whole 
at february   the hungarian subsidiary had million of us dollar denominated loans outstanding  excluding intercompany loans 
the hungarian subsidiary repaid these loans during the year ended february  the belgium  bulgarian and slovakian operations had no us dollar denominated loans outstanding during the years ended february  or february  
table of contents at february   approximately million of cash held at our foreign entities in hungary and slovakia was denominated in us dollars 
at february   our hungarian entity also held approximately million of cash denominated in euros 
the remainder of our cash balances held at our foreign entities is denominated in their respective local currencies 
emmis currently does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to foreign currency translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
