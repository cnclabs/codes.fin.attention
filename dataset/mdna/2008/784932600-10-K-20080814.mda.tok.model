table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of saba 
the following are included in our md a overview  critical accounting policies  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
overview general we help organizations manage their most important asset their people 
we provide the premier software platform for enterprise learning  collaboration  performance  and talent management  as well as license updates and product support  ondemand  implementation  training  and consulting services 
our people management solutions drive organizational excellence by bringing a disciplined approach to aligning  developing  and managing people across the entire organization 
by using saba to manage their extended workforce  our customers achieve demonstrably higher levels of performance through increased productivity  sales and service effectiveness reduced personnel development and training costs improved organizational agility and execution our solutions help our customers through the implementation of a management system for aligning goals  developing and motivating people and measuring results 
by implementing our solutions  organizations are better equipped to align their workforce around the organization s business objectives  effectively manage growing regulatory requirements  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate the productivity of new people joining the extended enterprise of employees  customers  partners  and suppliers  increase both the speed of customer acquisition and long term customer loyalty  shorten time to market of new products  and improve visibility into organizational performance 
background we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april on may   we completed the acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc thinq  a provider of enterprise learning management solutions which allowed us to expand our customer base and provided greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation and increase stockholder value 
on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc centra  a provider of online learning and training software and services 
we believe our acquisition of centra strengthened our competitive position in the human capital management market and provided us with a broader and deeper product offering 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition our customer base substantially increased 
the centra acquisition included 
table of contents total purchase consideration of million 
we have included the results of operations of centra in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  in connection with the acquisition of centra  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development  or ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
we have expensed this amount in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in australia  canada  france  germany  india  japan  and the united kingdom through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
sources of revenue we generate revenues from the sale of software licenses  ondemand services  annual license updates and product support and professional services 
software licenses we license our software solutions in multi element arrangements that include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
to date  a substantial majority of our software license revenue has been derived from the saba learning product suite 
for the foreseeable future  we expect the saba enterprise suite and saba centra product suite to generate substantially all of our software license revenues 
our license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to twelve months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
ondemand ondemand revenue includes revenue derived from term based managed application services 
these services are provided pursuant to customer agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
the associated ondemand revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we believe that ondemand revenue will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their contracts on expiration and that we will continue to add new ondemand customers 
licenses updates and product support license updates and product support includes the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our license updates and product support revenue depends upon both our sales of additional software licenses and annual renewals of existing license updates and product support agreements 
we believe that license updates and product support revenue will grow steadily for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and the sale of new software licenses will increase the number of customers that purchase license updates and product support 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting  education and strategic services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that license software directly from us 
these consulting 
table of contents and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after licensing the software 
generally  consulting services related to software implementations are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our customers generally engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and on a fixed fee basis 
strategic services are less dependent than consulting and education services on the sale of our licenses 
strategic services present additional opportunities that arise at different times throughout a customer life cycle 
in arrangements that include professional services and ondemand offerings  but not a license of our software  we recognize revenue for professional services as the services are performed if these professional services qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
if the professional services do not qualify as a separate element of the arrangement  the related revenue is combined with the subscription revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription service period 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees  including our ondemand and license update and product support personnel  and the fees of third party subcontractors  who provide professional services to our clients 
additionally  costs of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges on the necessary ondemand infrastructure  third party license royalty costs  and overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses 
the amortization of acquired developed technology  comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in the acquisition of centra software  inc in  is also included in the cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses 
because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses  an increase in services  including ondemand services  as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
additionally  when our professional services revenue is combined with our ondemand subscription revenue  we  also defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable service period 
we categorize deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
as of may   the deferred balance of the professional services revenue related to such ondemand offerings and the related deferred costs was million and  respectively 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription service period  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to ondemand revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of purchased intangible assets and in process research and development  to the research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries including stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate communication  rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenues addressed below in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to certain ondemand offerings  license updates and product support and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
license revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
license updates and product support revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically months 
in arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  we allocate the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual license of similar products 
revenue related to professional services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we provide professional services on a time and materials basis  a portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for services performed on a fixed fee basis  revenues are generally recognized on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality 
table of contents of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method or  if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services  we use the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with sop and relevant guidance of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred and the item has been accepted by the customer 
revenue from our ondemand offerings is recognized as a service arrangement whereby the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
certain of our ondemand offerings are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software  in which case revenue is recognized under the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our ondemand offerings also include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these ondemand offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop in arrangements that include professional services and ondemand offerings  but not a license of our software  we recognize revenue for professional services as the services are performed if these professional services qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
if the professional services do not qualify as a separate element of the arrangement  the related revenue is combined with the subscription revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription service period 
additionally  we defer the direct costs related to the professional services and recognize them ratably over the applicable service period 
we categorize deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription service period  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to ondemand revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on the aging of the accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
past due balances based on purchase order terms and other specific accounts as necessary are reviewed monthly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill balance at may  was million  including million and million recorded as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  respectively 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the recorded amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of and record an expense for an impairment loss 

table of contents restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was  which was for facilities related charges  as part of the purchase accounting for the centra acquisition 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to factors such as changes in property occupancy rates and rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and may be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs or a decrease of the purchase price 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined 
share based compensation 
on june   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas r generally requires share based payments to employees to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to june   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and applied the disclosure provisions of sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under apb  we generally did not recognize any compensation expense for stock options granted to employees or outside directors as the exercise price of our options was equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation prior to june   the estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method 
in addition  we reduced pro forma stock based compensation expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred 
in march  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of sfas r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation 
on december   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides guidance to issuers on the method allowed in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas r 
the staff will continue to accept  under certain circumstances  the use of the simplified method beyond december  sab was effective beginning january  we did not use the simplified method subsequent to december  upon our adoption of sfas r  we were required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
under sfas r  the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
also in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes merton bsm pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the options 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
beginning in our fiscal year  sfas r required the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock based 
table of contents award activity under sfas r to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities  as was prescribed under accounting rules applicable to our fiscal year and prior 
as we do not expect to realize any of these benefits  due to operating losses  no such amounts have been recorded through may  the accounting guidance under sfas r is relatively new and several interpretations have been released since the pronouncement has been issued 
additional interpretations may be released and the application of these principles may be subject to further refinement over time 
in addition  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting periods 
results of operations years ended may   and on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc and have included centra s results of operations from the date of acquisition in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations and the related discussions include centra s operating results for the years ended may  and and for four months of the year ended may  accordingly  the acquisition had a significant impact on our fiscal over fiscal growth rates 
our acquisition of centra did not result in any new reportable segments

license revenue 
license revenue decreased  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift from sales of license to ondemand services 
license revenue increased million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was caused by higher license sales activity  partially offset by delays closing certain contracts and contingencies included in certain contracts in the second half of fiscal and a shift from license sales activity to ondemand bookings relative to license bookings

restructuring charges during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program to consolidate excess facilities as a result of our acquisitions of thinq and centra 
during fiscal  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions

table of contents our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described under the caption item a risk factors

as of may   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily a result of adjusting our net loss of million for non cash expenses related to stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million  as well as an increase in deferred revenue of million 
these increases to our cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of  in fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of our net loss for the fiscal year of million  adjusted for non cash expenses related to stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million  as well as a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million

table of contents revenue  timing of billing of our professional services revenue  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our dso increased during fiscal due in part to each of these factors and primarily impacted by the timing of our billing of our professional services revenues 
cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal was to purchase additional equipment for use in our operations 
cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net cash acquired through the acquisition of centra of million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million

the credit facility provides for i a term loan in a principal amount of  and ii a receivables borrowing base revolving credit line in an aggregate principal amount of up to  which includes a sub limit of up to  for letters of credit  cash management and foreign exchange services 
in november  we amended the credit facility to add an equipment facility up to a principal amount of  both the term loan and the equipment facility are required to be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal  plus interest 
the equipment facility s term begins with the date of each advance under the contract 
we obtained advances on november  and february  the maturity date of the term loan and the revolving credit line is january  the interest rate applicable to the loans under the credit facility is the bank s prime rate plus for the term loan and the bank s prime rate plus for borrowings under the revolving credit line and the equipment facility

we currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit facility  combined with cash flows generated from revenues  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of may   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings and investments 
on january   we entered into a credit facility with a bank 
the credit facility provides for i a term loan in a principal amount of  and ii a receivables borrowing base revolving credit line in an aggregate principal amount of up to  which includes a sub limit of up to  for letters of credit  cash management and foreign exchange services

variable interest rates may produce more expense than expected if interest rates rise 
a change in interest rates would not be significant 
we are required to pay an early termination fee if the credit facility is terminated by the bank due to the occurrence of an event of default or is refinanced by another financial institution  in each case  prior to the second anniversary of the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by all of our personal property other than our intellectual property 
the credit facility includes certain negative covenants restricting or limiting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create liens on its property  make certain investments and acquisitions  merge or consolidate with any other entity  convey  sell  lease  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  change its business  experience a change of control  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates

the credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the credit facility prior to their stated maturity date  our ability to borrow under the revolving credit line may be terminated  and the bank may be able to foreclose on any collateral provided by us

at may   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was invested in accounts bearing variable interest rates of between and 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents is held in non interest bearing accounts at several banks 
variable interest rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
a change in interest rates would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made 
table of contents in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from inter company accounts with our foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  and  when re measured and translated in us dollars  have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during fiscal  our total realized and unrealized gains due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily australian dollars  british pounds  european union euros  japanese yens and indian rupees  was  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
