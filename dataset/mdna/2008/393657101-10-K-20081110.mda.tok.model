item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we currently operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  refurbishment parts and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from four facilities in the united states us  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
the refurbishment parts segment performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities in the united states and mexico as well as wheel  axle and bearing servicing  and production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
segment performance is evaluated based on margins 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
our manufacturing backlog of railcars for sale and lease as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of billion 
this compares to  units valued at million as of august  based on current production plans  approximately  units in backlog are scheduled for delivery in fiscal year the current backlog includes approximately  units that are subject to our fulfillment of certain competitive conditions 
a portion of the orders included in backlog includes an assumed product mix 
under terms of the order  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
in addition  a substantial portion of our backlog consists of orders for tank cars which are a new product type for us in north america 
marine backlog was approximately million as of august   of which approximately million is scheduled for delivery in fiscal year and the balance through subsequent to year end  additional orders were received increasing backlog to approximately million 
prices for steel  a primary component of railcars and barges  have risen significantly and remain volatile 
in addition the price of certain railcar components  which are a product of steel  are adversely affected by steel price increases 
during fiscal year  both steel and railcar component suppliers are imposing surcharges  which have also risen significantly and remain volatile 
subsequent to year end  prices for steel  railcar components and scrap steel have declined but remain volatile 
new railcar and marine backlog generally either includes fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges  or contracts that contain actual pass through of material price increases and surcharges 
on certain fixed price railcar contracts actual price increases and surcharges have caused the total price of the railcar to exceed the amounts originally anticipated  and in some cases  the actual contractual sale price of the railcar 
when the anticipated loss on production of railcars in backlog is both probable and estimable  we accrue a loss contingency 
a loss contingency reserve of million was accrued during fiscal year  of which million was remaining in the reserve as of august  we are aggressively working to mitigate these exposures 
the company s integrated business model has helped offset some of the effects of rising steel scrap prices  as a portion of our other business segments benefit from rising steel scrap prices through enhanced margins 
we are aggressively seeking to reduce our selling and administrative and overhead costs  including reductions in headcount 
as a result  during the year million was expensed for severance at several locations  and we continue to pursue additional cost savings 
our cost reduction efforts have been offset somewhat by costs associated with integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives 
on april  the company purchased substantially all of the operating assets of roller bearing industries  inc rbi for million 
rbi operates a railcar bearings reconditioning business from its facility in elizabethtown  kentucky 
reconditioned bearings are used in the refurbishment of railcar wheelsets 
the financial results since the acquisition are reported in the company s consolidated financial statements as part of the refurbishment parts segment 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents on march  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets of american allied railway equipment company and its affiliates aare for million in cash  plus or minus working capital adjustments 
the purchase price was paid from existing cash balances and credit facilities 
we acquired two wheel facilities in washington  illinois and macon  georgia which supply new and reconditioned wheelsets to freight car maintenance locations and to new railcar manufacturing facilities 
we also acquired aare s parts reconditioning business in peoria  illinois  where we recondition railcar yokes  couplers  side frames and bolsters 
the financial results since the acquisition are reported in the company s condensed consolidated financial statements as part of the refurbishment parts segment 
on march   our canadian railcar manufacturing facility  trentonworks ltd 
trentonworks filed for bankruptcy with the office of the superintendent of bankruptcy canada whereby the assets of trentonworks are being administered and liquidated by an appointed trustee 
beginning on march  the results of trentonworks were de consolidated 
the company has not guaranteed any obligations of trentonworks and does not believe it will be liable for any of trentonworks liabilities 
results of operations overview total revenue was billion  billion and million for the years ended august   and net earnings for  and were million or per diluted common share  million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share 
manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar and marine production 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all facilities 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years  and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were approximately  units in compared to  units in and  units in manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to due to lower railcar deliveries primarily due to the current economic slowdown of the north american market 
manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  from to due to lower railcar deliveries offset somewhat by a change in product mix to railcar types with higher per unit sales prices 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to rising steel prices and surcharges  loss contingencies of million accrued on certain future production  million of severance  lower production levels and start up costs and production inefficiencies at our mexican joint venture facility  partially offset by relief of certain contractual obligations 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a less favorable product mix  million in negative margins on our canadian facility in  start up costs on our new railcar manufacturing joint venture in mexico and production difficulties and inefficiencies realized on certain conventional railcar types 
refurbishment parts segment refurbishment parts revenue was million  million and million for the years  and the million increase in revenue from to was primarily due to a full year of revenue from the meridian rail acquisition which was completed in november  million of additional revenue related to aare and rbi acquisitions  strong wheelset volumes and higher scrap steel prices 
the million increase in revenue from to was primarily due to acquisition related growth of approximately million  increased volume of refurbishment and retrofitting work at repair and refurbishment facilities and favorable scrap pricing 
refurbishment parts margin as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and higher margins in are a result of the growth of our wheel business  which includes a full year of meridian rail the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents and the current year acquisitions of aare and rbi  higher margin wheel reconditioning work and the positive impact of higher scrap steel prices 
this was partially offset by lower volumes of program work at the repair facilities 
the acquisition of meridian in resulted in a greater mix of wheel reconditioning work which combined with increases in volume of railcar maintenance and refurbishment programs  retrofitting work and high scrap prices resulted in the margin increase as compared to leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years  and the million decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a million decrease in gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet  lower interim rents on assets held for sale and decreased interest income from lower cash balances 
the decline was partially offset by higher car hire revenue from additions to the lease fleet and increased maintenance revenue 
the million increase in revenue from to was primarily the result of a million increase in gains on sale of assets from the lease fleet partially offset by a million decrease in interest income resulting from lower cash balances 
during  we realized million in pre tax earnings on the disposition of leased equipment compared to million in and million in assets from our lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 
leasing services margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and in the decrease from to was primarily a result of declines in gains on disposition of assets from the lease fleet  interest income and interim rents on assets held for sale  all of which have no associated cost of revenue 
the decrease from to was primarily a result of declines in interim rent and interest income  decreased utilization on car hire leases  increases in transportation and storage costs on assets held for sale and higher maintenance costs of the railcar fleet  partially offset by gains on dispositions from the lease fleet 
other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and the million increase from to is primarily due to increased employee costs including severance of million related to reductions in work force  integration costs of recent acquisitions and costs associated with our mexican joint venture facility that commenced production in may  partially offset by the closure of our canadian facility 
the million increase from to is primarily due to million associated with operations of businesses acquired in  million in overhead costs associated with our canadian manufacturing facility that was permanently closed during may  professional services and consulting fees for strategic initiatives and integration of acquired companies  costs associated with improvements to our technology infrastructure and increases in compensation expense related to restricted stock grants 
interest and foreign exchange expense was million  million and million in  and interest and foreign exchange expense increased million from to mainly due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
interest expense decreased million 
foreign exchange loss increased million from a million loss in to million loss in interest and foreign exchange expense increased million from to due to higher debt levels and foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign exchange losses of million were recognized in compared to foreign exchange gains of million in in addition  results include a million write off of loan origination costs on our prior revolving credit facility 
in april  the company s board of directors approved the permanent closure of the company s canadian railcar manufacturing facility  trentonworks 
as a result of the facility closure decision  special charges of million were recorded during consisting of severance costs and professional and other fees 
special charges of million were recorded during associated with the impairment and subsequent closure of trentonworks 
these changes consist of million of impairment of property  plant and equipment  million of inventory impairment  million impairment of goodwill and other  million of severance costs and million of professional and other fees

table of contents income tax our effective tax rate was  and for the years ended august   and tax expense for included a million charge associated with deferred tax assets and operating losses without tax benefit incurred by our canadian subsidiary during its closure process 
included a million increase in valuation allowances related to net operating losses generated in poland and mexico 
in addition  a million tax benefit resulted from reversing income tax reserves associated with certain tax positions taken in prior years 
tax expense for included an million tax benefit associated with the write off of our investment in our canadian subsidiary for tax purposes and no tax benefit associated with special charges related to the canadian plant closure costs and losses incurred by the canadian facility 
also included tax benefits of approximately million for mexican asset based tax credits and amended state income tax provisions 
tax expense for included million associated with a settlement with the irs in conjunction with completion of an audit of our tax returns for the years in addition  included a million tax benefit for a reduction in a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards at our mexican subsidiary 
this allowance was reversed based on financial projections that indicated we will more likely than not be able to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
the fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses  minimum tax requirements in certain local jurisdictions and operating losses for certain operations with no related accrual of tax benefit 
minority interest the minority interest of million and million for the years ended august  and represents our joint venture partner s share in the losses of our mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture that began production in liquidity and capital resources we have been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
at august  cash was million  a decrease of million from million at the prior year end 
cash usage was primarily for the acquisitions of aare and rbi and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities for the years ended august   and was million  million and million 
the change was primarily due to timing of working capital needs including purchases and sales of railcars held for sale  timing of inventory purchases and varying customer payment terms 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended august  of million compared to million in and million in cash utilization in was primarily due to the acquisitions of aare and rbi and capital expenditures for the year 
the increased cash utilization for was primarily due to the acquisitions of meridian rail holdings corp 
meridian and rail car america rca 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million and million in  and were attributable to leasing services operations 
our capital expenditures have decreased based on current market conditions and fleet management objectives 
we regularly sell assets from our lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
proceeds from the sale of equipment were approximately million  million and million in  and leasing services capital expenditures for  net of proceeds from sales of equipment  are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for  and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in and primarily relate to increased efficiency  start up of our tank car line at the mexican joint venture  erp implementation and maintenance of existing equipment

table of contents refurbishment parts capital expenditures for  and were million  million and million and are expected to be approximately million in for maintenance of existing facilities  erp implementation and some expansion 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended august  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in during  we received million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings and million in net proceeds under revolving credit lines 
we repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
during  we received million in net proceeds from term loan borrowings  repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
during  we received an aggregate of million in net proceeds from a senior unsecured debt offering and a convertible debt offering  repaid million in term debt and paid dividends of million 
all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
senior secured revolving credit facilities  consisting of two components  aggregated million as of august  a million revolving line of credit is available through november to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment  principally for the us and mexican operations 
advances under this facility bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition  lines of credit totaling million  with various variable rates  are available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
as of august  these european credit facilities have maturities that range from november  through august  approximately of available borrowings for the european credit facilities have maturity dates in the second half of fiscal year european credit facility renewals are continually under negotiation and we currently anticipate million to be repaid rather than renewed 
as of august  outstanding borrowings under these facilities aggregated million in revolving notes and million in letters of credit 
this consists of million in revolving notes and million in letters of credit outstanding under the us credit facility and million in revolving notes under the european credit facilities 
available borrowings under credit facilities are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and interest coverage ratios which as of august  levels would provide for maximum additional borrowing of million 
the revolving and operating lines of credit  along with notes payable  contain covenants with respect to the company and various subsidiaries  the most restrictive of which  among other things  limit the ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  pay dividends or repurchase stock  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  including joint ventures and non us subsidiaries  including but not limited to loans  advances  equity investments and guarantees  enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of substantially all the company s assets  and enter into new lines of business 
the covenants also require certain minimum levels of tangible net worth  maximum ratios of debt to equity or total capitalization and minimum levels of interest coverage 
currently we are seeking a line of credit to support certain of our foreign operations due in part to current limitations in our existing loan covenants 
in accordance with customary business practices in europe  we have million in bank and third party performance  advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities  all of which have been utilized as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these performance  advance payment and warranty guarantees 
we have advanced million in long term advances to an unconsolidated subsidiary which are secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
as of august   this same unconsolidated subsidiary had million in third party debt for which we have guaranteed or approximately million 
we have outstanding letters of credit aggregating million associated with facility leases and payroll 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inability to predict future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when railcars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
loss contingencies on certain fixed price railcar contracts actual price increases and surcharges may cause the total cost to produce the railcar to exceed the amounts originally anticipated  and in some cases  the actual contractual sale price of the railcar 
when the anticipated loss on production of railcars in backlog is both probable and estimable the company will accrue a loss contingency 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the accrual and are adjusted at a later date to reflect actual costs 
new accounting pronouncements initial adoption of accounting policies in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income tax an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income tax provisions 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on september  at the adoption date  the company identified certain tax the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents benefits taken for which a reserve for uncertain tax positions was required under fin the total amount of this reserve  including interest and penalties  is million  of which million is associated with purchase accounting adjustments on the acquisition of meridian rail holdings corp 
these amounts had previously been reserved under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
with the exception of million which was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings in the three months ended november  the company recorded additional interest expense of million relating to reserves for uncertain tax provisions during the fiscal year interest and penalties related to income taxes are not classified as a component of income tax expense 
when unrecognized tax benefits are realized  the benefit related to deductible differences attributable to ordinary operations will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense 
the benefit related to deductible differences attributable to purchase accounting may result in a reduction to goodwill 
within the next months the company reasonably expects a decrease of approximately million in the current fin reserve  with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense of million  goodwill of million and selling and administrative expenses of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
we believe the exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our floating rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at august   the exposure to interest rate risk is reduced since of our debt has fixed rates and has floating rates 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
