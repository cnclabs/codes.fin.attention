item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the caption risk factors in this report 
overview background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in licensing and development of proprietary product candidates for the treatment of diseases and disorders in the fields of psychiatry and neurology 
we recently completed our nda for silenor tm and submitted it to the fda on january  we have also in licensed the product candidate nalmefene for the treatment of impulse control disorders 
we completed a pilot phase clinical trial for nalmefene in smoking cessation with positive results 
we also completed a phase clinical trial for nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling that did not achieve statistical significance for the primary or secondary endpoints 
we are evaluating the results from both of these clinical trials before making determinations regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
we were incorporated in august and are a development stage company 
during  we focused on hiring our executive team and initial operating employees and on in licensing our first product candidate  silenor tm 
during  we initiated two phase clinical trials for silenor tm and entered into in license agreements for nalmefene and acamprosate 
during  we initiated our phase clinical trials for silenor tm  commenced a phase clinical trial on nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling  initiated a pilot phase clinical trial for nalmefene for smoking cessation  and began working on a new formulation for acamprosate 
in december  we completed our initial public offering in which we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of million after deducting issuance costs of million 
in conjunction with the completion of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
during  we completed all of our clinical trials for silenor tm and nalmefene  initiated non clinical studies for silenor tm and continued our formulation development work for acamprosate 
during  we focused on completing our non clinical studies  preparing our nda for silenor tm and seeking a strategic collaboration to optimize the commercial success of silenor tm 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our accumulated deficit to continue to increase for the next several years as we manage the regulatory approval process for our silenor tm nda  prepare for potential commercialization of silenor tm and potentially pursue development of other product candidates 
silenor tm we submitted our nda for silenor tm to the fda on january  our nda includes the data from our completed clinical development program for silenor tm  which included four phase and two phase clinical trials that were randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy and safety of silenor tm for the treatment of insomnia 
all of the clinical trials demonstrated statistically significant differences relative to placebo on their primary endpoints and multiple secondary endpoints 
in addition  our nda submission for silenor tm included data from our non clinical development program  including the genotoxicity  reproductive toxicology and week transgenic mouse carcinogenicity non clinical studies of silenor tm  which were undertaken based on a request from the fda in may we continue to plan to submit the results of our standard two year carcinogenicity study as a post approval commitment 
we initiated that study  which is a two year carcinogenicity study in rats  in august and expect results in the first quarter of 
table of contents we are in discussions with third parties to optimize the commercial success of silenor tm 
we are also conducting market preparation activities to prepare for the launch of silenor tm 
we also intend to prepare to co promote or market silenor tm to specialists and high prescribing physicians of insomnia treatments 
nalmefene and acamprosate in july  we announced the results from our pilot phase clinical trial evaluating the use of nalmefene for smoking cessation 
in this trial  nalmefene demonstrated numerically higher smoking abstinence rates relative to placebo and incidences of adverse events were comparable to those observed in clinical trials previously conducted with nalmefene 
in december  we completed our phase clinical trial evaluating nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling 
nalmefene did not demonstrate statistically significant differences compared to placebo on the primary or any secondary endpoints and the most frequently reported adverse events were insomnia  nausea and dizziness 
elevation in liver enzymes was observed in some nalmefene treated patients 
we are evaluating the results from both of these clinical trials before making determinations regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
in  we in licensed the patents associated with acamprosate s use in movement disorders  obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder 
after receiving and analyzing the results of our phase formulation development work relating to acamprosate  we made the determination not to move forward with further development of acamprosate 
we then terminated our license agreement for acamprosate  effective as of january  revenues as a development stage company  we have not generated any revenues to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales until we enter into a strategic collaboration or are able to commercialize silenor tm ourselves 
license fees our license fees consist of the costs incurred to in license our product candidates 
we charge all license fees and milestone payments for acquired development and commercialization rights to operations as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future use 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our non clinical development program for silenor tm  clinical trials managed by our cros  costs associated with submitting and seeking approval of our nda for silenor tm  regulatory expenses  drug development costs  salaries and related employee benefits  as well as share based compensation expense 
in our most significant costs were associated with our non clinical development program for silenor tm and the preparation and submission of our nda for silenor tm  whereas in and our most significant costs were associated with services provided by cros  investigators and consultants relating to our clinical trials 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain a significant component of our operating expenses in the future as we continue our non clinical studies and seek nda approval for silenor tm and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources are not attributable to specific projects 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
we use external service providers to conduct our non clinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture the product candidates used in our studies 
these external costs are tracked on a project basis and are expensed as incurred 

table of contents at this time  due to the risks inherent in the regulatory approval process of our nda for silenor tm and the non clinical and clinical development process  and given the nature of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of product candidates for potential commercialization 
non clinical and clinical development timelines  the probability of success and the costs of development of product candidates vary widely 
the lengthy process of completing non clinical testing  seeking regulatory approval  and conducting clinical trials requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in obtaining regulatory approval  or completing non clinical testing or clinical trials  would cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or other strategic transactions  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of product candidates or collaboration agreements  if at all 
marketing  general and administrative our marketing  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation expense  advertising  market research costs  insurance and facility costs  and professional fees related to our marketing  administrative  finance  human resources  legal and internal systems support functions 
we anticipate increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  prepare for the commercialization of silenor tm and potentially pursue the development of other product candidates 
remeasurement of series c warrant liability in conjunction with our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in june  we issued a warrant that provided for the sale of additional shares of series c preferred stock at the election either by us or the series c preferred stockholders 
the warrant instrument was treated as a net liability and periodically remeasured to its fair value with corresponding expense or income recognized within operating expenses 
in september  we exercised our right to require the series c preferred stock investors to purchase additional shares of series c preferred stock 
immediately prior to exercise  the value of the warrant was remeasured to its fair value  resulting in the recognition of total expense relating to the warrant of million for the year ended december  no further series c warrant expense will be recognized in future periods 
interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include expenditures relating to our clinical trials  non clinical studies  our nda filing for silenor tm and drug development costs which we expense as they are incurred 
measurement of these expenses requires judgment as we may not have been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs  making it necessary to estimate the efforts completed to date and the related expense 
expenses recorded for our clinical trials  non clinical studies  nda work and drug development expenses are based on estimates of the 
table of contents services received and efforts expended to date pursuant to contracts with research institutions  cros and other vendors that conduct our clinical trials  non clinical studies  assist with our regulatory filings and approval process  and conduct drug development work 
the period over which services are performed  the level of services performed as of a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
our principal vendors operate within terms of contracts which establish program costs and estimated timelines 
we assess the status of our programs through regular discussions between our program management team and the related vendors 
based on these assessments  we determine the progress of our programs in relation to the scope of work outlined in the contracts  and recognize the related amount of expense accordingly 
we adjust our estimates as actual costs become known to us 
changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
license fees costs related to patents and acquisition of intellectual property are expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures is in connection with our development efforts and has no alternative future use 
certain of our in license agreements contain provisions which obligate us to make milestone payments or provide other consideration if specified events occur 
determining whether these events will occur  and the timing of such events  requires judgment on the part of management 
the subjective nature of these estimates can make it difficult to determine the extent to which a milestone obligation may be earned  and the period to which the related expense may apply 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss as if a fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  deferred stock compensation was recognized to the extent the price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant  as determined in our retrospective fair value analysis performed in conjunction with our initial public offering  exceeded the exercise price of the stock options 
sfas no 
r is applicable to our employee and director stock options and restricted stock awards 
measurement and recognition of share based compensation under sfas no 
r involve significant estimates and subjective inputs 
the grant date fair value of share based payment awards is determined using an option valuation model  such as the black scholes model which we use  and the amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by many complex and subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimates of our future volatility  employee exercise behavior  the expected term for our stock options  the number of options expected to ultimately vest  and the timing of vesting for our share based awards which contain performance vesting conditions 
our stock did not have a readily available market prior to our initial public offering in december  creating a short history from which to obtain data to estimate volatility for our stock price 
consequently  we estimate our expected future volatility based on comparable companies and our own stock price volatility to the extent such history is available  when determining the grant date calculated value for stock options 
in estimating the expected term for our options  we applied the guidance in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 which provides a formula driven approach for determining the expected term 
share based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
certain of our share based awards vest upon the achievement of performance conditions 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking 
table of contents estimates  the actual value of our stock options could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we have incurred significant net operating losses to date which have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire years after being generated for federal tax purposes and ten years after being generated for california tax purposes 
we also have research and development credits which begin to expire years after being generated for federal purposes  and do not expire for california purposes 
we have fully reserved our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits until such time that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than occurs within a three year period 
we determined that such an ownership change occurred as of june  due to various stock issuances used to finance our development activities 
this ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes  including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we estimate that million of our california net operating loss carryforwards were effectively eliminated 
additionally  million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards  million of our state net operating loss carryforwards and million of our federal research and development credits were subject to limitation 
a portion of the limited net operating loss carryforwards becomes available for use each year 
we estimate that approximately million of the restricted net operating loss carryforwards become available each year between and  decreasing to approximately million thereafter 
at december   we estimate that million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of our state net operating loss carryforwards remain limited 
net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits generated subsequent to the ownership change are currently not subject to limitations  but could be subject to limitations in the future if additional ownership changes occur

the fair value of this instrument was determined at the time of grant and recorded as a liability with subsequent changes in its fair value recorded through the statement of operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed through the private placement of equity securities and our initial public offering 
through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows from august to january  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  from april to june  we issued and sold  shares of series b preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in june  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in september  the series c warrant was exercised and we issued and sold  shares of series c redeemable preferred stock for net proceeds of million  in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock  and since inception on august  through december   we have issued approximately  shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from which we received aggregate proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash funds in commercial paper  corporate and united states securities agency notes and money market funds placed with reputable financial institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated 
we have established guidelines relating to credit rating  diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a reduction in our net loss as a result of the conclusion of our silenor tm and our nalmefene clinical trial programs 
this was offset in part by increased salaries and overhead costs associated with an increase in employee headcount and an expansion of our facilities 
we cannot be certain if  when  or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of silenor tm or any other product candidate that we may develop 
we expect our operating expenses to be substantial over the next few years as we seek approval of our nda for silenor tm  prepare to potentially commercialize silenor tm and potentially develop other product candidates 
we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive  sub licenseable rights to the patents and know how for certain indications 
we generally are required to make upfront payments as well as additional payments upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory approval milestones 
we are also obligated to pay royalties under the agreements until the later of the expiration of the applicable patent or the applicable last date of market exclusivity following the first commercial sale 

table of contents the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due by period through through after total in thousands operating lease obligations minimum payments under license agreements total all of the minimum payments under license agreements pertain to our nalmefene program 
in addition  under our license agreements we are obligated to make revenue based royalty payments as well as additional milestone payments of up to million upon the occurrence of certain product development events 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
the million of additional milestone payments consists of a million milestone payment related to our silenor tm program and million of milestone payments related to our nalmefene program 
the million silenor tm milestone payment would be payable to procom one upon approval of our nda for silenor tm by the fda 
this milestone payment is not reflected in our financials as it is not considered to be incurred at this time 
we are assessing the results from the nalmefene pathological gambling and smoking cessation clinical trials before making a determination regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
if the nalmefene program is not continued  the million of milestone payments relating to nalmefene would not be paid and the portion of the minimum payments under license agreements disclosed in the table above from the date of termination forward would also not be paid 
minimum license payments are subject to increase based on the timing of various events and the extent to which the licensed technologies are pursued for other indications 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials and non clinical studies  and perform data collection and analysis 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our development programs 
therefore  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and related commercialization activities  the progress of our non clinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  including milestone payments to procom one and biotie therapies  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs of establishing manufacturing  sales or distribution capabilities  the success of the commercialization of silenor tm or any other product candidate that we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  debt financing  assigning receivables or royalty 
table of contents rights  strategic collaborations or other strategic transactions 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement could allow us to obtain additional financing of up to million 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing  entering into collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  or that additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development  or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures 
this statement will first be effective for us for the year beginning january  in december  the fasb released a proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b effective date of fasb statement no 
which was ratified in february and delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are in the process of analyzing the effects of this pronouncement 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  we do not expect to change our method of fair value recognition 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
eitf no 
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities be deferred and recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
we will adopt eitf no 
as of january   and it is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
which  under certain circumstances  extends the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term for employee stock options established in sab no 
sab no 
provides that it is reasonable for a company to continue to use the simplified method of determining the expected option term when a company has insufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected option 
we expect to continue to use the simplified method for determining its expected employee option term because  as a result of our relatively recent initial public offering in december  there is a limited amount of historical exercise data from which to form a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
we estimate our expected term for employee stock options to be years which was calculated using guidance provided by the sec in sab no 
upon adopting sfas no 
r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
it changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning january  and will apply to business combinations completed on or after that date 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be characterized as non controlling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity 
purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  unless we engage in a transaction which results in minority interest  we currently do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  consisted primarily of money market funds  commercial paper and corporate and united states government agency notes 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities including money market funds  commercial paper and government and corporate debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we also generally time the maturities of our investments to correspond with our expected cash needs  allowing us to avoid realizing any potential losses from having to sell securities prior to their maturities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effect on various securities markets 
our cash is invested in accordance with a policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our treasury managers and a review of our holdings 
our money market funds are with institutions that have minimal mortgage backed security exposure  and our commercial paper and corporate notes are with companies and agencies that continue to be highly rated 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value
