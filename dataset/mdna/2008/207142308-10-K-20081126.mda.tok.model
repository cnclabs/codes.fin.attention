our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday closest to september fiscal year was a week year and ended on october  fiscal years and were week years and ended on september  and september   respectively 
business enterprise segments we operate in one reportable segment  broadband communications 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements 
although we had two operating segments at october   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas no 
 we only operate in one reportable segment  broadband communications 
under sfas no 
 two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas no 
 if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 

table of contents we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of semiconductor products is the only material source of revenue for each of our two operating segments  the products sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard manufacturing process  the products marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to similar customers  and all of our products are sold through our internal sales force and common distributors 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth above and each of our operating segments has similar economic characteristics  we aggregate our results of operations in one reportable segment 
in early fiscal  we decided to discontinue our investments in stand alone wireless networking products and technologies 
as a result  we have moved gateway oriented embedded wireless networking products and technologies  which enable and support our dsl gateway solutions  into our broadband access product line beginning in fiscal in august  we completed the sale of our bmp product lines to nxp 
as a result  the revenues generated by sales of bmp products have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
net revenues from continuing operations by product line are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended imaging and pc media broadband access products results of operations net revenues we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times per year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any periods presented 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue with respect to sales to certain distributors was deferred until the products were sold by the distributors to third parties 
at september   deferred revenue related to sales to these distributors was million 
during the three months ended october   we evaluated three distributors for which revenue has historically been recognized when the purchased products are sold by the distributor to a third party due to our inability in prior years to enforce the contractual terms related to any right of return 
our evaluation revealed that we are able to enforce the contractual right of return for the three distributors in an effective manner similar to that experienced with the other distributor customers 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced the recognition of revenue on these three distributors upon shipment which is consistent with the revenue recognition point of other distributor customers 
as a result  in the three month period ended october   we recognized million of revenue on sales to these three distributors related to the change to revenue recognition upon shipment with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold of million 
at october   there is no significant deferred revenue related to sales to our distributors 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at october  and september   deferred revenue 
table of contents related to shipments of products for which we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
our net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline was driven by an decrease in net revenues generated by our imaging and pc media business  which comprises of our total net revenues 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in average selling prices asps which was offset slightly by a increase in unit volume shipments 
in addition  net revenues generated by our bba business unit  which comprises of our total net revenues  decreased by as a result of a decline in unit volume shipments offset slightly by a increase in asps 
these declines were partially offset by approximately million of non recurring revenue from the buyout of a future royalty stream 
our net revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by an decrease in average selling prices asps and an decrease in unit volume shipments 
during fiscal  we experienced revenue decreases in a majority of our product lines 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties for wafer production and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalties  other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead associated with product procurement and non cash stock based compensation charges for procurement personnel 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal our gross margin percentage for fiscal includes a non recurring royalty buyout of million which occurred in the first quarter 
the royalty buyout contributed to our gross margin percentage during fiscal the remaining increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to the continued cost reduction efforts and product mix 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million gain related to the cancellation of a wafer supply and services agreement with jazz semiconductor jazz  which was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales 
excluding this gain  our gross margin percentage for would have remained relatively stable in compared to because of manufacturing cost reductions offsetting the reduction in asps for fiscal we assess the recoverability of our inventories on a quarterly basis through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over the following twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
similarly  in the event that actual demand exceeds original projections  gross margins may be favorably impacted in future periods 
during fiscal  we recorded million of net charges for excess and obsolete e o inventory 
during fiscal  we recorded million of net credits for e o inventory 
activity in our e o inventory reserves for fiscal and was as follows in thousands fiscal year ended e o reserves  beginning of period additions release upon sales of product scrap standards adjustments and other e o reserves  end of period 
table of contents we review our e o inventory balances at the product line level on a quarterly basis and regularly evaluate the disposition of all e o inventory products 
it is possible that some of these reserved products will be sold  which will benefit our gross margin in the period sold 
during fiscal and  we sold million and million  respectively  of reserved products 
our products are used by communications electronics oems that have designed our products into communications equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
moreover  once a customer has designed a particular supplier s components into a product  substituting another supplier s components often requires substantial design changes  which involve significant cost  time  effort and risk 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
on a quarterly basis  we also assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated asp  less costs to sell our inventory  falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
during fiscal and  we recorded credits of million and million  respectively  to adjust certain products to their estimated market values 
increases to the lower of cost or market lcm inventory reserves may be required based upon actual asps and changes to our current estimates  which would impact our gross margin percentage in future periods 
research and development our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs to develop new semiconductor products  allocated indirect costs of the r d function  photo mask and other costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  and design and test tool costs 
our r d expenses also include the costs for design automation advanced package development and non cash stock based compensation charges for r d personnel 
r d expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in r d headcount from september to september other restructuring activities and cost cutting measures also contributed to the reduction in r d expense 
the decrease in r d expense was offset slightly by a correcting adjustment of million  representing the unamortized portion of the capitalized photo mask costs as of september  based upon an evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  and after considering the provisions of apb  paragraph  and sab nos 
and  we believe that this correcting adjustment was not material to our estimated full year results for in addition  we do not believe the correcting adjustment is material to the amounts reported in previous periods 
r d expense decreased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in r d headcount from september to september other restructuring activities and cost cutting measures also contributed to the reduction in r d expense 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  sales representative commissions  advertising and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions including legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  customer service  sales  marketing  field application engineering  allocated indirect costs of the sg a function  and non cash stock based compensation charges for sg a personnel 
sg a expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decline in sg a headcount from september to september as well as restructuring measures and other cost cutting efforts 
sg a expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  a million decrease in 
table of contents legal fees primarily due to the settlement of our litigation with texas instruments in the third quarter of fiscal and a million decrease in payroll expense as a result of our restructuring efforts 
these decreases were partially offset by the impact of million of credits related to property tax settlements that were recorded in fiscal the decrease in stock based compensation expense resulted from declines in the expense related to the stock options assumed in the merger with globespanvirata  inc in reaching the end of their three year vesting period 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in various business combinations 
our intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately two years 
amortization expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in amortization expense is primarily attributable to the impairment of the intangible assets related to our former wireless business unit recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal amortization expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were due to the million impairment charge and write down of certain intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal  the modification of the useful lives of some of the intangible assets acquired in the merger with globespanvirata  inc and some intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal asset impairments asset impairment charges for fiscal of million consisted primarily of goodwill impairment charges of million  intangible impairment charges of million and property  plant and equipment charges of million and electronic design automation tool charges of million  resulting from the current challenges in the competitive dsl market that caused the net book value of certain assets within the bba business unit to be considered not fully recoverable 
asset impairment charges for fiscal of million consisted primarily of goodwill impairment charges of million and intangible impairment charges of million related to declines in the embedded wireless network product lines coupled with our decision to discontinue further investment in stand alone wireless networking product lines 
special charges fiscal year ended in thousands litigation charges restructuring charges voluntary early retirement plan verp settlement charge other special charges special charges for fiscal consisted primarily of restructuring charges of million that were primarily comprised of employee severance and termination benefit costs related to our fiscal restructuring actions 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million related to the settlement of our liability related to the verp via the purchase of a non participating annuity contract 
special charges for fiscal consisted primarily of an million charge for the settlement of our litigation with orckit communications ltd 
and restructuring charges of million that were primarily comprised of employee severance and termination benefit costs related to our fiscal restructuring actions and  to a lesser extent  facilities related charges mainly resulting from the accretion of rent expense related to our fiscal restructuring action 

table of contents special charges for fiscal consisted primarily of a million charge related to the settlement of our patent infringement litigation with texas instruments incorporated in may and million of net restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges were primarily comprised of employee severance and other termination benefit costs and facilities closure costs mainly for our fiscal restructuring action  partially offset by a net reduction of the accrual relating to our fiscal restructuring action due to revised estimates of the remaining employee severance and termination benefit costs to be paid 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of million and million of our senior secured notes in march and september  respectively  debt refinancing activities implemented in fiscal and declines in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
interest expense increased million  or during fiscal compared to fiscal the average interest rate that we paid on our outstanding debt and our average debt balances during fiscal was higher than in fiscal due to the timing of the our debt issuances and retirements during fiscal and other income expense  net fiscal year ended in thousands investment and interest income decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments impairment of equity securities loss on rental property gain on sale of property gains on investments in equity securities other other income expense  net for fiscal was primarily comprised of million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances  a million decrease in the fair value of our warrant to purchase six million shares of mindspeed common stock mainly due to a decline in mindspeed s stock price during fiscal and million of expense related to a rental property 
in addition  the sale of property  primarily related to the sale of a building in noida  india generated a gain of million 
other income  net for fiscal was primarily comprised of million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances  million of gains on investments in equity securities  including primarily the gain of million on the sale of our skyworks shares and investment credits realized on asset disposals 
other expense  net for fiscal was comprised of a million charge for the other than temporary impairment of equity securities including an million charge related to our million shares of skyworks common stock and a million decrease in the fair value of our warrant to purchase six million shares of mindspeed common stock mainly due to a decline in mindspeed s stock price during fiscal  partially offset by million of investment and interest income on invested cash balances and million of gains on investments in equity securities 
provision for income taxes in fiscal  and  we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million  respectively  primarily reflecting income taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries 
the fiscal tax expense includes million of taxes due on the sale of a building 
all of our us federal income taxes and the majority of our state income taxes are offset by fully reserved deferred tax assets 
except to the extent of the federal and state 
table of contents alternative minimum tax amt  we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect our tax provision in future years to decrease slightly due to the contraction of our business activities outside of the us  primarily in india and china  partially offset by the scheduled expiration of certain tax holidays in india in fiscal as of october   we had approximately billion of net deferred income tax assets  which are primarily related to us federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards and capitalized r d expenses and which can be used to offset taxable income in subsequent years 
approximately million of the nol carryforwards were acquired in business combinations  and if we receive a tax benefit from their utilization  the benefit will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
the deferred tax assets acquired in the merger with globespanvirata are subject to limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code 
such limitations are not expected to impair our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets 
as of october   we have a valuation allowance recorded against the majority of our deferred tax assets  resulting in net deferred tax assets of million 
we do not expect to recognize any domestic income tax benefits relating to future operating losses until we believe that such tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
on september   the company adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  a company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
adopting fin had the following impact on the company s financial statements increased long term liabilities by million and retained deficit by million and decreased its long term assets by million and current income taxes payable by million 
as of september   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits of which million  if recognized  would affect its effective tax rate and million  if recognized  would reduce goodwill 
as of october   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits of which million  if recognized  would affect its effective tax rate and million  if recognized  would reduce goodwill 
the company s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes 
as of october  and september   the company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of million  net of income tax benefit on its balance sheet 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions and has also acquired and divested certain businesses for which it has retained certain tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
the company and its acquired and divested businesses are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
based on the results of an audit  a material effect on the company s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
the company files us and state income returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation 
the fiscal years through generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
the company is subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us  none of which are individually material to its financial position  statement of cash flows  or results of operations 
gain loss on equity method investments gain loss on equity method investments includes our share of the earnings or losses of the investments that are recorded under the equity method of accounting  as well as the gains and losses recognized on the sale of our equity method investments 
gain on equity method investments for fiscal was million 

table of contents gain on equity method investments for fiscal primarily consisted of a million gain from the sale of our investment in jazz 
loss on equity method investments for fiscal primarily consisted of a million loss from our investment in jazz including our share of jazz s expense related to the cancellation of the wafer supply and services agreement 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  sales of non core assets and operating cash flow 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased million between september  and october  the decrease was primarily due to the repurchase of million of our senior secured notes  a million reduction in our short term line of credit  the purchase of a multi function printer imaging product business for million  the restriction of million to secure a stand by letter of credit and million used in operating activities 
these decreases were offset by proceeds of million from the sale of the bmp business 
at october   we had a total of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 
these notes are due in march  but the holders may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or part of their notes on march   march  and march  at a price of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
at october   we also had a total of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes outstanding 
these notes are due in november  but we are required to offer to repurchase  for cash  the notes at a price of of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions if such proceeds are not used within days to invest in assets other than current assets related to our business 
the sale of the our investment in jazz semiconductor  inc jazz in february and the sale of two other equity investments in january qualified as asset dispositions requiring us to make offers to repurchase a portion of the notes no later than days following the february asset dispositions 
based on the proceeds received from these asset dispositions and our cash investments in assets other than current assets related to our business made within days following the asset dispositions  we were required to make an offer to repurchase not more than million of the senior secured notes  at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in february as a result of acceptance of the offer by our bondholders  million of the senior secured notes were repurchased during the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a pretax loss on debt repurchase of million during the second quarter of fiscal which included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
following the sale of the bmp business unit  we made an offer to repurchase million of the senior secured notes at of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in september as a result of the acceptance of the offer by our bondholders  million of the senior secured notes were repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a pretax loss on debt repurchase of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal which included the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
the pretax loss on debt repurchase of million has been included in net loss from discontinued operations 
due to the receipt of proceeds in excess of the million repurchase and other cash investments in assets  million of the senior secured notes have been classified as current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of october  we also have an million credit facility with a bank the credit facility  under which we had borrowed million as of october  the term of this credit facility has been extended through november   and the facility remains subject to additional day extensions at the discretion of the bank 
we lowered our borrowing limit on the credit facility to million due to the to overall lower business volumes  primarily driven by the sale of the bmp business during fiscal we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development  anticipated capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  additional operating losses or lower than expected 
table of contents product sales will adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition and could impair our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations as such obligations come due 
in addition  recent unfavorable economic conditions have led to a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in the credit and equity markets 
if the economy or markets in which we operate continue to be subject to adverse economic conditions  our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations will be adversely affected 
if the credit markets remain difficult to access or worsen or our performance is unfavorable due to economic conditions or for any other reasons  we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to repay amounts due under i our credit facility expiring november ii our million floating rate senior secured notes when they become due in november or earlier as a result of a mandatory offer to repurchase  and iii our million convertible subordinated notes when they become due in march or earlier as a result of the mandatory repurchase requirements 
the first mandatory repurchase date for our convertible subordinated notes is march  in the event we are unable to satisfy or refinance our debt obligations as the obligations are required to be paid  we will be required to consider strategic and other alternatives  including  among other things  the negotiation of revised terms of our indebtedness  the exchange of new securities for existing indebtedness obligations and the sale of assets to generate funds 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in completing any of these alternatives 
cash flows are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations and used million for working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
the changes in working capital were primarily driven by a million decrease in accounts payable due to overall lower business volumes  primarily driven by the sale of the bmp business  as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities related to the payment of an million litigation settlement in the first quarter of fiscal these decreases were offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable due to the overall lower business volumes which were primarily attributable to the sale of the bmp business 
cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we used million of cash from operations and made payments totaling million for restructuring related items 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million of net favorable changes in our working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
the net favorable working capital change was mainly caused by a decrease in days sales outstanding dso from days in the september quarter to days in the september quarter as a result of improved collections and sales linearity and decreased inventory levels resulting from reductions in channel inventory and revenue declines 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash provided by investing activities is primarily related to the million in proceeds on the sale of the bmp business  offset by the restriction of million to secure a stand by letter of credit related to one of our suppliers and million used to purchase a multi function printer imaging product business 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is the result of cash proceeds generated on the fiscal sales of our equity investment in jazz of million  our stock ownership interest in jazz of million  our stock ownership in skyworks of million and the liquidation of our marketable security investments of million 

table of contents cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal cash used in financing activities is primarily comprised of senior secured note repurchases of million and a million decrease in our short term line of credit 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal the increased use of cash in financing activities is the net result of our retirement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due february  offset by the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes in november contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations at october  were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year year years years years in thousands long term debt short term debt interest on debt operating leases purchase commitments as discussed above  the holders of the million convertible subordinated notes due march could require us to repurchase all or part of their notes as early as march  as a result  the convertible subordinated notes are presented as being due in years in the table above 
also  as discussed above  we are required to offer to repurchase all or part of the remaining million of our million senior secured notes due november with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions if such proceeds are not used within days to invest in assets other than current assets related to our business 
due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the bmp business in excess of the million repurchase and other cash investments in assets  million of the senior secured notes are presented as being due in less than one year in the table above 
at october   the company had many sublease arrangements on operating leases for terms ranging from near term to approximately eight years 
aggregate scheduled sublease income based on current terms is approximately million and is not reflected in the table above 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of million as of october  off balance sheet arrangements we have made guarantees and indemnities  under which we may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions 
in connection with our spin off from rockwell international corporation rockwell  we assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then current and future litigation including environmental and intellectual property proceedings against rockwell or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of the semiconductor systems business of rockwell 
in connection with our contribution of certain of our manufacturing operations to jazz  we agreed to indemnify jazz for certain environmental matters and other customary divestiture related matters 
in connection with the sales of our products  we provide intellectual property indemnities to our customers 
in connection with certain facility leases  we have indemnified our lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease 
we indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 

table of contents the durations of our guarantees and indemnities vary  and in many cases are indefinite 
the guarantees and indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits based upon the amount of the related product sales 
the majority of other guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in our consolidated balance sheets 
product warranty costs are not significant 
special purpose entities we have one special purpose entity  conexant usa  llc  which was formed in september in anticipation of establishing the credit facility 
this special purpose entity is a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary of ours 
conexant usa  llc is not permitted  nor may its assets be used  to guarantee or satisfy any of our obligations or those of our subsidiaries 
on november   we established an accounts receivable financing facility whereby we will sell  from time to time  certain insured accounts receivable to conexant usa  llc  and conexant usa  llc entered into an million revolving credit agreement with a bank that is secured by the assets of the special purpose entity 
in november  we extended the term of this revolving credit agreement through november  in addition  we lowered our borrowing limit on the revolving credit agreement to million due to overall lower business volumes primarily driven by the sale of the bmp business during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements

sfas is effective for periods beginning on or after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
this change is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r and other gaap 
the requirement for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp on our financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement apb 
apb requires the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the guidance will result in companies recognizing higher interest expense in the statement of operations due to amortization of the discount that results from separating the liability and equity components 
apb will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
based on our initial analysis  we expect that the adoption of apb will result in an increase in the interest expense recognized on our convertible subordinated notes 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf states that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities as defined in eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 and therefore should be included in computing earnings per share using the two class method 
according to fsp eitf  a share based payment award is a participating security when the award includes non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents 
the rights result in a non contingent transfer of value each time an entity declares a dividend or dividend equivalent during the award s vesting period 
however  the award would not be considered a participating security if the holder forfeits the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents in the event that the award does not vest 
fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
when adopted  its requirements are applied by recasting previously reported eps 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of fsp eitf and have not yet determined the impact of adoption 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
table of contents and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to business combinations  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  deferred income taxes  valuation of warrants  valuation of equity securities  stock based compensation and restructuring charges 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
business combinations we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d  we typically engage a third party valuation firm to assist management in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and ipr d entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe that the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected by incurring charges to our statements of operations 
additionally  estimates for purchase price allocations may change as subsequent information becomes available 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price and terms are fixed and determinable  and iv the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these terms are typically met upon shipment of product to the customer 
the majority of our distributors have limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of product in their inventory two times a year 
we recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor  as the stock rotation rights are limited and we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate and establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any periods presented 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue with respect to sales to certain distributors was deferred until the products were sold by the distributors to third parties 
at september   deferred revenue related to sales to these distributors was million 
during the three months ended october   we evaluated three distributors for which revenue has historically been recognized when the purchased products are sold by the distributor to a third party due to our inability in prior years to enforce the contractual terms related to any right of return 
our evaluation revealed that we are able to enforce the contractual right of return for the three distributors in an effective manner similar to that experienced with the other distributor customers 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced the recognition of revenue on these three distributors upon shipment which is consistent with the revenue recognition point of other distributor customers 
as a result  in the three month period ended october   we recognized million of revenue on sales to these three distributors related to the change to revenue recognition upon shipment with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold of million 
at october   there is no significant deferred revenue related to sales to our distributors 
revenue with respect to sales to customers to whom we have significant obligations after delivery is deferred until all significant obligations have been completed 
at october  and september   deferred revenue related to shipments of products for we have on going performance obligations was million and million  respectively 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our operations and the timing of revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions 
revenue 
table of contents results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we use a specific identification method for some items  and a percentage of aged receivables for others 
the percentages are determined based on our past experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
at october  and september   our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  respectively 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand  generally over twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycle information 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand or product pricing is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
further  on a quarterly basis  we assess the net realizable value of our inventories 
when the estimated average selling price of our inventory net of selling expenses falls below our inventory cost  we adjust our inventory to its current estimated market value 
at october  and september   our inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
they are also continually monitored and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using available market data  comparable asset quotes and or discounted cash flow models 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the 
table of contents carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in july the fasb issued interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
we adopted fin effective september  and the provisions of fin have been applied to all income tax positions commencing from that date 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin has been reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of our accumulated deficit as of september  prior to fiscal we determined our tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
deferred income taxes we evaluate our deferred income tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance is based upon our history of operating results  expectations of future taxable income and the ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to us 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would be charged against income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  in the event we were to determine that we will more likely than not be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
to the extent that we realize a benefit from reducing the valuation allowance on acquired deferred income tax assets  the benefit will be credited to goodwill 
valuation of warrants we have a warrant to purchase six million shares of mindspeed common stock 
the fair value of this warrant is determined using a standard black scholes merton valuation model with assumptions consistent with current market conditions and our intent to liquidate the warrant over a specified time period 
the black scholes merton valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions  or in the underlying valuation model  could cause the fair value of the mindspeed warrant to vary significantly from period to period 
valuation of equity securities we have a portfolio of strategic investments in non marketable equity securities and also hold certain marketable equity securities 
we review equity securities periodically for other than temporary impairments  which 
table of contents requires significant judgment 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors  i the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
these reviews may include assessments of each investee s financial condition  its business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or by others 
we have experienced substantial impairments in the value of our equity securities over the past few years 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in our inability to recover the carrying amounts of our investments  which could require additional impairment charges to write down the carrying amounts of such investments 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
this pronouncement revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires that companies account for awards of equity instruments issued to employees under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
r on october  under sfas no 
r  we are required to measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the service period that the awards are expected to vest 
as permitted under sfas no 
r  we elected to recognize compensation cost for all options with graded vesting granted on or after october  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire option 
for options with graded vesting granted prior to october   we will continue to recognize compensation cost over the vesting period following the accelerated recognition method described in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  as if each underlying vesting date represented a separate option grant 
under sfas no 
r  we record in our consolidated statements of operations i compensation cost for options granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after october  under the provisions of sfas no 
r and ii compensation cost for the unvested portion of options granted prior to october  over their remaining vesting periods using the fair value amounts previously measured under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosure purposes 
consistent with the valuation method for the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
r  we use the black scholes merton model to value the compensation expense associated with stock options under sfas no 
r 
in addition  forfeitures are estimated when recognizing compensation expense  and the estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
the black scholes merton model requires certain assumptions to determine an option fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
the expected stock price volatility rates are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or award 
the average expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or awards granted are expected to be outstanding  as calculated using the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission s sab no 
consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  we measure service based awards at the stock price on the grant date  performance based awards at the stock price on the grant date effected for performance conditions which we believe may impact vesting or exercisability and market performance based awards using the monte carlo simulation method giving consideration to the range of various vesting probabilities 
in november the fasb issued staff position no 
sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  or sfas r we have elected to adopt the 
table of contents alternative transition method provided in sfas r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation expense  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that were outstanding at the adoption of sfas r 
in addition  in accordance with sfas r  sfas  and eitf topic d  intraperiod tax allocation of the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations  we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us 
restructuring charges restructuring activities and related charges have related primarily to reductions in our workforce and related impact on the use of facilities 
the estimated charges contain estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time that the assumptions are made for example  the timing and amount of sublease income that will be achieved on vacated property and the operating costs to be paid until lease termination  and the discount rates used in determining the present value fair value of remaining minimum lease payments on vacated properties 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the relevant periods  the actual results may be different  and those differences could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
our policies require us to review the estimates and assumptions periodically and to reflect the effects of any revisions in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
such amounts also contain estimates and assumptions made by management  and are reviewed periodically and adjusted accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  the mindspeed warrant  short term debt and long term debt 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
consequently  we invest with only high credit quality issuers  and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of october   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we hold a warrant to purchase six million shares of mindspeed common stock at an exercise price of per share through june for financial accounting purposes  this is a derivative instrument and the fair value of the warrant is subject to significant risk related to changes in the market price of mindspeed s common stock 
as of october   a decrease in the market price of mindspeed s common stock would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of this warrant 
at october   the market price of mindspeed s common stock was per share 
during fiscal  the market price of mindspeed s common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under a day credit facility 
interest related to our short term debt is at day libor plus  which is reset weekly and was approximately at october  in connection with our extension of the term of this credit facility through november   the interest rate applied to our borrowings under the facility increased from day libor plus to day libor plus 
we do not believe our short term debt is subject to significant market risk 
our long term debt consists of convertible subordinated notes with interest at fixed rates and floating rate senior secured notes 
interest related to our floating rate senior secured notes is at three month libor plus  which is reset quarterly and was approximately at october  at october   we are party to two interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of million to eliminate interest rate risk on million of our floating rate senior secured notes due under the terms of the swaps  we will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate equal to three month libor  which will offset the floating rate paid on the notes 
the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuation due to their convertibility into shares of our common stock 

table of contents the following table shows the fair values of our financial instruments as of october  in thousands carrying value fair value in thousands cash and cash equivalents mindspeed warrant short term debt long term debt senior secured notes long term debt convertible subordinated notes we transact business in various foreign currencies  and we have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  from time to time  we offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign transaction gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at october   we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional amount of million indian rupees  approximately million  maturing at various dates through december based on the fair values of these contracts at october   we recorded a derivative liability of million at october  based on our overall currency rate exposure at october   a change in the currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
