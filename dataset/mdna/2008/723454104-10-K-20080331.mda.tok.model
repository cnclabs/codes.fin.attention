the company produces business from both existing and new programs 
the company continues to focus on its profitable growth strategy and continues to pursue higher value added business with better margin potential 
the decline in gross profit on service sales was caused by an increase in lower margin storage device repair programs in the sales mix  especially in the emea region where the company split its service profits with aspan 
with the acquisition of aspan  which occurred in february  the company will benefit by receiving the entire profit margin on this service business 

table of contents the overall increase in product gross margin was due to the elimination of lower margin sales  as discussed above  cost benefits from the completion of the plan  and new programs at higher profit margins 
the company continues to believe that as sales revenues and gross profit margins increase through the organic growth of existing customers and other additional global business  the results of operations will be positively affected 
gross margins will vary from program to program  and the mix of programs will vary from quarter to quarter causing the gross margin percentages to vary from quarter to quarter 
consequently  it is difficult to predict quarterly gross margin results on future sales

the decrease in value of the deferred tax assets required a charge to income tax expense

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the financial statements contained herein describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts  changes in inventory reserves  and income tax rates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets or liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of amounts reported in the financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies  as applicable 
the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments are set forth below cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued expenses are carried at cost as this approximates fair value due to their short term nature 
line of credit and short term notes have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement  delivery has occurred and title  ownership  and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for product sales  this occurs upon transference of title to the customer 
for repair sales  this occurs upon completion of the repair work and the item is either returned to the customer  or returned to a customer owned inventory location in the company s warehouse in accordance with repair programs

for an inventory and logistics management program  revenue is recognized in the month in which the services are provided 
for non recurring engineering projects  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
for certain end of life product management service programs  we may purchase inventory components no longer in production that are necessary for the program based on the customer s estimated needs  with the agreement that the customer will purchase any remaining items after an agreed upon period 
the company will carry such inventory for a period of time and upon the completion of that period  the company will sell any remaining inventory to the customer and recognize revenue 
certain customers ask that this inventory remain located at our sites for potential future use in small end of life production runs or in repair programs 
we evaluate such bill and hold arrangements for revenue recognition against the criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin these arrangements typically meet the criteria because they are entered into at the customer s request  are required due to their business purpose to secure a supply of component parts that will no longer be manufactured  title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  and we physically segregate such components from company owned inventory

table of contents general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible as determined by a continuous review of the customer s ability to pay 
payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory and respective reserves the carrying values of component parts and finished goods represent average cost or management s estimate of its net realizable value 
such value is based on forecasts of product orders  repair trade in activity in the ensuing years  and management s knowledge of the current market for component parts and finished goods 
the forecasts of product orders and repair trade in activity are based on historical information  known contracts  and management s expertise in computer hardware life cycles

furniture and fixtures  computer equipment and related software  and shop equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from to years
