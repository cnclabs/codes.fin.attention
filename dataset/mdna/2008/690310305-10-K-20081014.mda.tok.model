see the business section in part i  item of this report for more information about our business  products and operations 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial position and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection appliances 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling spare parts  selling maintenance contracts and rendering related services and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
historically  the majority of our sales have been generated through private label arrangements with original equipment manufacturers oems  and the remainder have been made through commercial distributors  direct market resellers dmrs and value added resellers vars in our branded channel 
however  our strategy moving forward is to focus heavily on the delivery of new and expanded products to our branded channel  which historically has produced higher gross margins in comparison to oem business 
declining sales to hp 
in august  our largest oem customer  hewlett packard company hp  notified us that it had selected an alternate supplier for its next generation mid range tape automation products 
hp began purchasing the first product of this new line from the alternate supplier during the first quarter of calendar year although we believe that sales to hp will continue to decline  hp has recently relaunched the tape automation products supplied by us with support for hp s new lto tape drives  which may slow the rate of replacement of our supplied products by the alternate supplier s product 
revenue from hp in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to fiscal impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of its long lived assets  excluding the long lived assets from the recently completed snap server acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements  as of june   due to the our continued operating and cash flow losses in and our forecasts for and beyond 
we concluded that the carrying amount of the primary asset group was not recoverable and an impairment loss should be recognized 
recent setbacks 
during fiscal  we experienced lower than anticipated revenue for a number of reasons including during the first three quarters of fiscal  we were focused on re building our sales team 
this process took longer than anticipated and as a result had a negative impact on sales 
as noted below  although sales and marketing expenses were lower than prior year  this was at the detriment of branded channel revenue 
we experienced a delay in the launch of our reo d product  which was not released until november previous setbacks 
during fiscal  we experienced significant setbacks related to the outsourcing of our manufacturing to sanmina sci corporation sanmina  our supply contract with dell computer dell  and the commercialization of the technology we acquired from zetta systems  inc zetta in september  we announced a plan to outsource all of our manufacturing to sanmina  a us third party manufacturer 
we completed this transfer in august during fiscal  however  we failed to achieve the customer service levels  product quality and cost reductions we expected from the outsourcing 
additionally  we incurred a significant amount of redundant costs to support the outsourcing  which eroded our gross margins during the year 
consequently  we decided to bring manufacturing back to our san diego facility and entered into a transition agreement with sanmina effective september in february  we completed the transfer of all production lines back to san diego  and in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the purchase of the remaining inventory under the transition agreement 
in october  we announced that we would supply dell with our next generation tape library that was under development arcvault 
we spent considerable resources during the ensuing year to complete the development of this tape library and to meet dell s specifications and other requirements 
in october  we were notified by dell of its intent to terminate the supply agreement 
shipments of the tape libraries had not yet commenced at that date but were expected to begin shortly 
in august  after a year of development  we launched our ultamus pro product which incorporated the technology we acquired from zetta 
we had planned to facilitate our entry into the primary protected disk market with ultamus pro  but this product failed to achieve market acceptance 
in october  we discontinued our research and development efforts on the zetta technology  and recorded an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related in large part to the overall decline in hp revenue  we reported net revenue of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decline in net revenue resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal positive trends 
despite the disappointing financial results in recent quarters  we have achieved a number of financial and operational objectives  some of which we believe will assist us in our efforts to regain profitability operating expenses continued to decrease compared to fiscal and fiscal due to the completion of a number of material intensive development projects and continued strict expense control efforts 
operating expenses for the years ended june   and were million including a million charge for software code which we expect to incorporate into a new product currently under development and a million impairment charge on long lived assets  million and million  respectively 
general and administrative g a expense has continued to decrease through continued strict expense control efforts 
g a expense totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
research and development r d expense  including the million charge in the second quarter of fiscal for software code which we expect to incorporate into a new product currently under development  decreased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in r d expense is primarily attributed to completion of labor intensive projects during late fiscal and early fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal and million is fiscal the decrease is primarily attributed to a reduced sales force as we rebuilt our sales force through our third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we increased inventory turns while decreasing inventory levels 
we continue to target reducing inventory levels and push toward higher inventory turns 
having completed the transfer of manufacturing back to our headquarters in san diego in february  our product lead times have been reduced to target levels and we believe that we have regained our reputation for timely delivery of quality products 
we also have resolved the backlog issues that arose during the outsourced period 
in fiscal  we launched three new products the reo c  in late september  the reo c  in october  and the reo d  in november we have additional reo products scheduled for launch through fiscal we expect these new reo products to contribute to an improvement in branded sales in future periods 
in june  we acquired the snap server nas business from adaptec  inc  including the brand and all assets related to the snap server networked and desktop storage appliances 
the purchase price  excluding transaction costs  was million  with approximately million paid in cash upon the closing of the transaction  the remainder to be paid in months 
the snap server product line broadens our capabilities by adding distributed nas while also strengthening central and remote office data protection 
we believe the acquisition will enable us to address the billion smb nas market  which according to idc continues to grow by at least annually 
liquidity and capital resources 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million approximately million of which relates to an impairment of our auction rate securities and approximately million of which relates to the reclassification of our auction rate securities to other assets compared to the balance at june  at june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at june  we have no unused source of liquidity at this time 
cash management and preservation will continue to be a top priority 
however  we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar as we introduce and market our new products  including our snap server appliances 
we are currently exploring funding alternatives to enable us to continue our operations and execute our strategy 
possible funding alternatives we are exploring include bank or asset based financing  equity or equity based financing  including convertible debt  and factoring arrangements 
we are in discussions with funding sources for each of these options  but we currently have no funding commitments 
management projects that our current cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations at current levels only into november if we are unable to obtain additional funding  we will be forced to liquidate certain assets where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain of our planned operations 
any of these actions could harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we anticipate we will need to raise approximately million of cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through fiscal at planned levels 
as a result of our need for additional financing and other factors  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our plans to raise working capital are first to pursue bank and asset based financing options  however  we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  our plans are to pursue an equity or equity based financing  including convertible debt  which also may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted 
the amount of dilution could be increased by the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
as noted above  as of june   our other assets included million of auction rate securities  which securities have a par value of million 
the auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term will bring less than the value of these securities as of june   based upon subsequent indicative bids 
for example  indicative bids ie  one measure of the estimated liquidation value from deutsche bank subsequent to year end for our ars instruments have ranged from a high of approximately million at july   to a low of approximately million at october   the most recent bid as of the date of this report 
industry trends 
historically  magnetic tape has been used for all forms of data backup and recovery  because magnetic tape was  and still is  the only cost effective  removable  high capacity storage media that can be taken off site to ensure that data is safeguarded in case of disaster 
for a number of years now  we have held a market leading position in mid range tape automation with our flagship neo products  and sales of tape automation appliances have represented more than of our revenue for each of the last three fiscal years 
in fiscal  we launched arcvault  our new tape automation platform 
revenue from arcvault products represented and of total net revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although we expect that tape solutions will continue to be the anchor of the data protection strategy at most companies  tape backup is time consuming and often unreliable and inefficient 
the process of recovering data from tape is also time consuming and inefficient 
ultimately  we expect that tape will be relegated to an archival role for less frequently accessed data  and that companies will focus more on disk based solutions moving forward 
recent developments in april  we announced the appointment of ravi pendekanti as our vice president of worldwide marketing  a position that had been vacant since october in august  mr 
pendekanti s role was expanded to include vice president of worldwide sales 
in august  we reduced our employee workforce by worldwide  or by employees  in accordance with our initiatives to reduce costs and restructure our workforce 
severance costs  including cobra  related to the terminated employees are estimated to be  and will be recorded and paid in our first and second quarters of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  available for sale securities  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors and certain oem customers is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
as part of our existing agreements with certain oem customers  we ship products to various distribution hubs around the world and retain ownership of that inventory until it is pulled by these oem customers to fulfill their customer orders  at which time revenue is recognized 
for products in which software is more than incidental  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
when there are multiple elements in an arrangement  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based on relative fair value  provided we have fair value for all elements of the arrangement 
if in an arrangement we have fair value for undelivered elements but not the delivered element  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element s and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered element s 
undelivered elements typically include services 
revenue from extended warranty and product service contracts is initially deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period 
we have various royalty arrangements with independent service providers that sell our product and also sell and provide service on our product 
these independent service providers pay a royalty fee for service contracts in place  on our product 
the royalty fee is calculated by us for the units covered in the quarter  and agreed to by the service provider  based upon the monthly fee for each unit covered by the independent service provider 
in addition  we receive royalties from hp  for licensing of our protection os software 
revenue is recognized based upon quarterly reporting from hp related to the number of units sold 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
as consideration for licensing our vr technology  the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
on a periodic basis  the licensees provide us with reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
in certain instances  the customer has elected to purchase from us the applications specific integrated circuit asic chips embodying vr  which are priced to include the cost of the chip plus an embedded royalty fee  and revenue on asic chip sales is recorded as product revenue when earned  which under our fob origin terms is upon shipment  of the underlying asic chip incorporating the vr technology to the customer 
available for sale securities available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and temporary unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
and fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to i the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  ii the extent to which fair value is less than cost  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and  iv our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
we hold two auction rate securities ars which are collateralized by corporate debt obligations 
these auction rate securities are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  usually every days 
since july  our auction rate securities have experienced failed auctions and are considered to have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the two ars instruments held by us were downgraded by fitch ratings from aaa to a and a  respectively 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of investments when no quoted prices exist 
as allowed by statement of financial standards sfas no 
 we elected to estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis 
taking into consideration the security terms the assumptions used by us included estimates of i when a successful auction would occur or the securities would be redeemed  ii a discount rate commensurate with the implied risk associated with holding the securities  including consideration of the recent ratings downgrades  and iii future expected cash flow streams 
if the auctions continue to fail  or we determine that one or more of the assumptions used in the estimate needs to be revised  we may be required to record an additional impairment on these securities in the future 
as noted above  as of june   our other assets included million of auction rate securities  which securities have a par value of million 
the auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
our estimate of the fair value of the auction rate securities is based on the probability weighted expected future cash flows associated with the investments as indicated 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term will bring less than the value of these securities  as of june   based upon subsequent indicative bids 
for example  indicative bids ie  one measure of the estimated liquidation value from deutsche bank subsequent to year end for our ars have ranged from a high of approximately million at july  to a low of approximately million at october   the most recent bid as of the date of this report 
we do not believe this current estimate of the liquidation value represents the estimated fair value of the instruments as of the end our fiscal year 
the indicative bids are not based on active markets or orderly transactions between market participants 
however  it is possible that we may be required to record additional impairments to these investments in future periods 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
a change in our share based compensation for the year ended june   would have affected net losses by approximately million in fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made this determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
generally  our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification of amounts outstanding greater than days from invoice date 
if we fail to identify an account as doubtful  or if we identify an account as uncollectible that is later collected  our results could vary 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than what we projected  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
business acquisitions and intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in recognition of intangible assets acquired technology  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expenses  and in certain cases non recurring charges associated with in process research and development ipr d 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  while ipr d is recorded as a non recurring charge on the acquisition date 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets may include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales and services  maintenance agreements  and acquired development technologies and patents or trademarks  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value and useful lives are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could also produce significantly different results 
impairment of long lived assets we test for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment loss  for the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  is recognized with an offsetting reduction in the carrying value of the related asset s 
in such circumstances  we may incur material charges relating to the impairment of such asset 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or asset group using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million impairment related to our property and equipment 
see fiscal compared to fiscal impairment of long lived assets under the discussion of results of operations below 
the estimated fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as consideration of the estimated value that could be realized upon sale 
the assumptions used by us included estimates of i projected cash flows for a period approximating the remaining estimated useful life of the asset group  ii a discount rate commensurate with the implied risk in an investment in us and the risk of the underlying cash flows and iii an estimate of enterprise value 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an million impairment charge related to acquired technology 
see fiscal compared to fiscal impairment of long lived assets under the discussion of results of operations below 
if our future results are significantly different than forecasted  we may be required to further evaluate its long lived assets for recoverability and such analysis could result in an impairment charge in a future period 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using management s best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
warranty obligations the company provides for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  and discloses those obligations as required by fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
the impact of theses unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in subsequent periods 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in subsequent periods 
in addition  if we experience a decline in our historical warranty claims  due to lower return rates or repair costs  the impact on gross margin would be favorable 
income tax provision and uncertain tax positions the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that it is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
a decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a d ecrease in income tax benefit as we had in fiscal 
if the valuation allowance is released in a future period  income tax expense will be reduced accordingly 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated income tax provision and evaluating our us and foreign tax positions 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
 which became effective for us beginning july  fin no 
addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution audit 
the impact of our reassessment of tax positions in accordance with fin no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
if we are unable to uphold our position upon audit  it may impact our liquidity  results of operations or financial position 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on the guidance in fin no 
and our estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
restructuring charges in august and over the past several years  we recorded restructuring charges related to the realignment and restructuring of our business operations 
these charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs and acquisition integrations that we have implemented and consist of the cost of involuntary termination benefits  separation benefits and facilities charges 
the charges for severance and exit costs require the use of estimates  primarily related to the amount of severance and related benefits to be paid and the cost of exiting facilities 
we account for restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
restructuring charges we have incurred under sfas no 
in recent years include severance and facilities charges

fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decline was primarily the result of anticipated lower oem revenue  specifically from hp  reflecting the previously announced transition by hp to an alternate supplier 
in our branded channel  the decrease in net revenue was attributable to decreased volumes across all channels 
product revenue net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or net product revenue from oem customers decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is primarily associated with declining sales to hp 
net revenue from hp represented approximately of total net revenue during fiscal compared to of total net revenue during fiscal net product revenue from overland branded products  excluding service revenue  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  was primarily associated with i a decrease of million from neo products and ii a decrease of million due to the discontinuation of our power loader and loaderxpress products 
these decreases were offset by an increase in revenue from arcvault products of million and ultamus products of million 
the sales of our ultamus products have not yet achieved expected sales volumes 
service revenue net service revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is associated with i a million increase associated with an increase in the number of service contracts sold due to increased focus in this area and ii a million increase in of out of warranty services provided  primarily to hp 
royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily associated with lower vr royalties  partially offset by other royalty fees 
vr royalties during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million during fiscal gross profit 
overall gross profit increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or 
product revenue product gross profit increased to million  or  for fiscal compared to million  or  for fiscal the increase in product gross profit is associated primarily with i a million decrease in amortization expense because of the fiscal impairment of the zetta acquired technology and ii decreases in the amount of additional inventory reserves required in fiscal compared to fiscal service revenue service gross profit of million for fiscal increased from million for fiscal the increase in service gross profit of million  or  is primarily associated with an increase in warranty contracts recognized in fiscal compared to fiscal  as noted above 
stock based compensation 
during fiscal  we had share based compensation expense of million compared to a net reversal  or benefit  of  of share based compensation in fiscal the increase of approximately million is primarily due to a one time grant of approximately million share options in august to executive officers and key employees as a retention tool 
these options vest monthly for one year and are expected to result in increased share based compensation expense through the first quarter of fiscal share based compensation was allocated as follows in thousands fiscal year change cost of product revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to i a decrease of approximately million in employee and related expenses including travel and sales commissions related to a decrease in average headcount during the first three quarters of fiscal by employees in connection with our fiscal restructurings and the realignment of our sales force as of year end the average headcount was comparable to the prior year  ii a million reduction in severance primarily associated with the fiscal restructurings  and iii a million reduction in new product sales development expense due to decreased product launch activities in the current year 
these decreases were offset by i an increase of million in share based compensation expense associated with options granted in august compared to a net reversal of share based compensation expense in the second quarter of fiscal which was associated with awards canceled prior to vesting in excess of previous estimates  ii an increase of million in promotion and advertising expense due to the launch of new products  and iii an increase of million in trade show expense

liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at june  we have no unused source of liquidity at this time 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  we have incurred net losses for over the last three fiscal years and negative cash flows for our last two fiscal years 
as of or for the year ended june   we had an accumulated deficit of million  incurred a net loss of million and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million approximately million of which relates to an impairment of our auction rate securities and million of which relates to the reclassification of our auction rate securities as other assets compared to the balance at june  we operate in a highly competitive market characterized by rapidly changing technology 
during fiscal  we expect to continue to incur losses as we introduce and market our new products 
we are currently exploring funding alternatives to enable us to continue our operations and execute our strategy 
possible funding alternatives we are exploring include bank or asset based financing  equity or equity based financing  including convertible debt  and factoring arrangements 
we are in discussions with funding sources for each of these options  but we currently have no funding commitments 
management projects that our current cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to allow us to continue our operations at current levels only into november if we are unable to obtain additional funding  we will be forced to liquidate certain assets where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain of our planned operations 
any of these actions could harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we anticipate we will need to raise approximately million of cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through fiscal at planned levels 
as a result of our need for additional financing and other factors  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our plans to raise working capital are first to pursue bank and asset based financing options  however  we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  our plans are to pursue an equity or equity based financing  including convertible debt  which also may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted 
the amount of dilution could be increased by the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations in fiscal fully  we expect we will be forced to suspend or curtail certain of our operations  which could harm our business  results of operations  and future prospects 
as of june   our other assets included million of auction rate securities  which securities have a par value of million 
the auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term will bring less than the value of these securities  as of june   based upon subsequent indicative bids 
for example  indicative bids ie  one measure of the estimated liquidation value from deutsche bank subsequent to year end for our ars have ranged from a high of approximately million at july  to a low of approximately million at october   the most recent bid as of the date of this report 
during fiscal  we used cash in operating activities of approximately million compared to million in fiscal and cash provided from operating activities of million in fiscal the change from fiscal to of million is primarily attributed to our decreased net loss and decreases in our accounts receivable balance compared to fiscal from fiscal to  there was a change of million in cash used in operating activities

during fiscal and we liquidated some of our investments to support our operations 
in fiscal  we used million to acquire zetta with no other similar acquisitions in fiscal during fiscal  and  capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  such expenditures were primarily associated with tooling to support new product development 
during fiscal  such expenditures were primarily associated with computers  machinery and equipment to support new product development and transitioning manufacturing in house 
during fiscal  capital expenditures were comprised primarily of software and tooling equipment 
during fiscal  we had minimal cash activity in our financing activities compared to cash used in our financing activities of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we used cash of million and million  respectively  to repurchase  shares and million shares of our common stock 
these uses of cash were offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our espp and espp and upon exercise of stock options for proceeds of  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our espp and espp and upon exercise of stock options have decreased due to the decrease in our stock price since fiscal and the discount used in determining the purchase price under our espp 
in october  our board of directors expanded our share repurchase program to allow for the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock on the open market or through negotiated transactions 
in october  our board of directors terminated our share repurchase program and there were no share repurchases after the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  an aggregate of approximately  shares and million shares were repurchased at a cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties that are not fully recorded in our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments at june  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents contractual lease obligations under non cancellable operating leases on our san diego  ca  milpitas  ca  wokingham  england  paris  france  china and singapore facilities represents purchase orders for inventory and non inventory items entered into prior to june   with purchase dates extending beyond july  the obligations are not necessarily non cancellable 
liabilities associated with uncertain tax provisions  currently estimated at  including interest  are not included in the table above as we cannot reasonably estimate when  if ever  an amount would be paid to a government agency 
ultimate settlement of these liabilities is dependent on factors outside of our control  such as examinations by each agency and expiration of statues of limitation for assessment of additional taxes 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods presented 
historically we have been able to pass on to our customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation 
if at any time we cannot pass on such increases  our margins could suffer 
our exposure to the effects of inflation could be magnified by the concentration of oem business  where our margins tend to be lower 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the auction rate securities ars estimated fair value of million was reclassified to other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these securities  although not mortgage backed  have experienced failed auctions primarily as a result of the impact sub prime mortgages have had on liquidity in the credit markets 
ars instruments for fiscal  interest income was million with ars investments yielding an annual average of on a worldwide basis 
the interest rate level was down approximately basis points from in fiscal assuming consistent investment levels  if interest rates were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or basis points  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest income of approximately  during fiscal cash equivalents and short term investments for fiscal  total interest income was million with investments yielding an annual average of on a worldwide basis

foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and essentially all of our products sold in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france and germany incur costs which are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results when translated into us dollars may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results during fiscal was not material
