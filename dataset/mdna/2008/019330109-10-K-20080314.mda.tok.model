today  five companies form the core of allied motion 
the companies  emoteq  computer optical products  motor products  stature electric and premotec offer a wide range of standard motors  encoders and drives for original equipment manufacturers oem and end user applications 
a particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of its customers 
the company has made considerable progress in implementing its new corporate strategy  with the driving force of applied motion technology know how 
the company s commitment to allied s systematic tools  or ast for short  is driving continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost and growth 
ast utilizes a tool kit to effect desired changes through well defined processes such as strategy deployment  target marketing  value stream mapping  material planning  standard work and single minute exchange of dies 
one of the company s major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company s customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
currently  the company is producing some of its motor sub assemblies and finished products at sub contract manufacturing facilities in china and slovakia 
the company has increased efforts in to identify opportunities where production in low cost regions can improve profitability while delivering the same high quality products 
the company s products contain certain metals  and the company has been experiencing significant fluctuations in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are all key materials in our products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing material at lower cost from asian markets and by passing on surcharges and price increases to our customers 
the company continues to pursue aggressive motor and drive development plans for new products that leverage the combined technology base of the allied motion companies 
the company focuses on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher level  value added performance solutions and meet the needs of our served markets 
over the last few years  the company announced several new motor designs targeted at various markets 
it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
the company is realizing improved results from its new products and will continue to realize more improvements in the future 
management believes the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability

revenues revenues were  in compared to  in this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales in industrial  electronics  distribution and aerospace defense markets  partially offset by decreases in the medical mobility and vehicle markets 
the primary reasons for the decrease in sales to customers in the medical mobility market were caused by program changes by one of our large customers and also the reduction in medicare s payment for such products 
the primary reasons for the decline in the motor vehicle market are due to declines in the us construction industry and increased price competition from other low cost region producers 
we are placing an increased emphasis on our low cost region operations to ensure we are globally competitive on a cost basis while maintaining the same high technical and commercial standards we have already established 
sales to us customers accounted for of our sales in  with the balance to customers primarily in europe and canada 
sales to us customers were down for and sales to customers outside the us were up 
the weakness of the us dollar against the euro accounted for of sales increase in over gross margins gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for and this reflects the continued emphasis on sales of the company s industrial and electronics markets which provide a higher gross margin from their sales  the cost reductions realized from products being produced at the company s contract manufacturing facility in china  and the continuous improvement in efficiencies and productivity from implementation of the company s ast tools mostly offset by increases in the material costs of the company s products due to an increase in the cost of copper and the weakness in the value of the us dollar plus the under absorption of overhead costs in two of our divisions that experienced sales declines in selling expenses selling expenses were  and  in and  respectively

the decrease in interest is directly attributed to the decrease in outstanding debt obligations and lower interest rates

the effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was in and non gaap measures ebitda is provided for information purposes only and is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by the company s management to measure the operating performance of the company s business because ebitda excludes charges for depreciation  amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings  as well as our provision for income tax expense 
accordingly  the company believes that ebitda provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business  apart from the expenses associated with its physical assets or capital structure 
ebitda is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the company s industry 
ebitda does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s calculation of ebitda for year ended december  and is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  net income   interest expense provision for income tax  depreciation and amortization   income before interest expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda   liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased  during to a balance of  at december  the decrease compares to a  increase in during  operations provided  in cash compared to  during this significant increase of  is primarily due to improvements in receivables  inventories and accounts payable as a result of increased efforts to collect on sales in a more timely manner  continued implementation of lean accounting measures to limit the amount of inventory that must be kept on hand  and increased business activity  partially offset by an increase in income tax payments

this increased use of  is primarily the result of  additional net payments on debt and capital lease obligations  net of refinancing costs partially offset by an increase of  of cash received from employee stock transactions 
at december   the company had  of debt obligations representing borrowings on the term loan and line of credit 
the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the company s credit facilities 
on may   the company entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na and na morgan europe limited to provide term debt of million and revolving credit of up to million and million 
the new facility was used to pay off the company s existing domestic and european bank debt and will also provide funds for working capital needs and to finance future growth for the company

the new credit facility described above has a five year term 
the term debt is payable in twenty equal quarterly installments of  over the five year term 
no principal payments are required on the revolving credit facilities prior to maturity 
the interest rates on the agreement are variable rates based on one or more interest rate indices 
the interest rates in effect as of december  were on the term loan and on the line of credit

the facility had no outstanding balance as of december  the amount available under the overdraft facility was   at december  exchange rate 
price levels and the impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies  lower costs of materials and surcharges passed on to customers 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees
