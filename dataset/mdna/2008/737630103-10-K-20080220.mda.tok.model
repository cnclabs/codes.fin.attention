risk factors investing in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk 
in addition to the reit related risk factors discussed below  investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties presented under the following captions in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of part ii of this report reit conversion and factors influencing our results of operations and cash flows  all of which are incorporated herein by reference 
potlatch corporation 
table of contents reit related risk factors if we fail to remain qualified as a reit  income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations  including satisfaction of certain asset  income  organizational  distribution  stockholder ownership and other requirements  on a continuing basis 
given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a reit 
in addition  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us department of the treasury 
changes to the tax laws affecting reits  which may have retroactive application  could adversely affect our stockholders or us 
we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
if in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a reit  we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
in addition  we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions 
as a result  net income and the funds available for distribution to our stockholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer  which would have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock 
there are uncertainties relating to the estimate of our special e p distribution  which could result in our disqualification as a reit 
in order to remain qualified as a reit  we were required to distribute to our stockholders all of our accumulated non reit tax earnings and profits  or e p  prior to the end of our first taxable year as a reit  which was the taxable period ended december  in  a special e p distribution in the aggregate amount of approximately million was distributed to our stockholders 
we believe that the amount of our special e p distribution equaled or exceeded the amount required to be distributed in order to satisfy the requirements relating to the distribution of e p 
there are  however  substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of the amount of our pre reit e p  including the possibility that the irs could  in any audits for tax years through  successfully assert that our taxable income should be increased  which would increase our pre reit e p 
thus  we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distributed all of our pre reit e p by the close of our first taxable year as a reit 
moreover  although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our pre reit e p  we cannot now determine whether we would be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact on us of doing so

table of contents certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax on of our net income  which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to make distributions 
reits are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the internal revenue code  which for us generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio  growing timber  and selling standing timber 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale by us of wood products  pulp and paperboard  tissue products  certain types of timberlands sales  and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through potlatch trs because such activities generate non qualifying reit income and could constitute prohibited transactions if such activities were engaged in directly by the reit 
in general  prohibited transactions are defined by the internal revenue code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
by conducting our business in this manner  we believe we will satisfy the reit requirements of the internal revenue code and avoid the tax that could be imposed if a reit were to conduct a prohibited transaction 
we may not always be successful  however  in limiting such activities to potlatch trs 
therefore  we could be subject to the prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur  which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to make quarterly distributions

table of contents item legal proceedings beginning in february  a series of private antitrust lawsuits were filed against us and certain other manufacturers of oriented strand board osb by plaintiffs who claim they purchased osb at artificially high prices 
the cases have been consolidated into two consolidated amended class action complaints in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania under the caption in re osb antitrust litigation  one on behalf of direct purchasers of osb and the other on behalf of indirect purchasers 
the complaints allege that the defendant osb manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws by purportedly conspiring from mid to the present to drive up the price of osb 
the consolidated indirect purchaser complaint also alleges that defendants violated various states unfair competition laws and common law 
each consolidated complaint seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages to be trebled as provided under the antitrust laws and other relief 
the court has ordered that the cases may proceed as class actions 
it certified a nationwide class of direct purchasers who bought osb structural panel products directly from one of the defendants during the period from june  to february  it also certified a nationwide class of indirect purchaser end users who purchased new osb manufactured or sold by one of the defendants during the same time period  this class excludes persons who only bought osb that was incorporated into a house or other structure 
the claims of the nationwide indirect purchaser class are limited to injunctive relief 
however  the court also certified a multistate class of indirect purchasers in states whose members may recover compensation as allowed by state law 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims  and we are defending ourselves accordingly 
we sold our osb manufacturing facilities to ainsworth lumber co 
ltd 
in september on september   ainsworth notified us by letter of its claims under the indemnification provisions of the asset purchase agreement between us and ainsworth whereby ainsworth purchased our osb facilities 
the claims involve alleged breaches of representations and warranties regarding the condition of certain of the assets sold to ainsworth 
in july  ainsworth filed a complaint for breach of contract in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages 
the federal court case was subsequently dismissed voluntarily  and ainsworth refiled its complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of new york on september  we believe we have meritorious defenses to the claim  and we are defending ourselves accordingly 
we believe there is no pending or threatened litigation that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operations or liquidity
