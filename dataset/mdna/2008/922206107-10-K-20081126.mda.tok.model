table of contents airbags  refrigeration components and industrial processing equipment  in high energy physics research and medical devices such as linear accelerators  in various nuclear energy applications in nanotechnology applications such as surface scanning and nanomaterials fabrication  and in the manufacture and test of semiconductors and fabrication of metrology equipment 
marketing and sales we market and sell most of our products through our own direct sales organizations  although in certain countries and for certain products and services  sales are made through various sales representative and distributor arrangements 
to support this marketing and sales structure  we have sales and service offices in numerous locations around the world 
we sell our products on a global basis 
sales outside of north america accounted for  and of sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  our customers increasingly require service and support on a worldwide basis 
we have sales and service offices located throughout north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers worldwide 
demand for our products depends on many factors  including the level of capital expenditures of our customers  the rate of economic growth in applications and geographies where we sell our products and competitive considerations 
no single customer accounted for or more of our sales in fiscal year  or we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  in part because there are fewer working days in the first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems and superconducting magnets 
we believe that we differentiate our products from those of our competitors by our responsiveness to customer requirements  as determined through market research 
although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications  customers generally demand superior performance  ease of use  high quality  high productivity and low cost of ownership 
we have responded to these customer demands by regularly introducing new products focused on these requirements 
backlog our recorded backlog was million at october   million at september  and million at september  the decrease in backlog from september  to october  was primarily due to a net reduction in unfulfilled orders for magnets from third party oems  even though orders for these magnets increased in fiscal year compared to the prior year 
the decrease in backlog from september  to september  was primarily due to a net reduction in unfulfilled orders for mr imaging systems and to a lesser extent for vacuum products 
these decreases were partially offset by strong order volume for analytical instruments and to a lesser extent the impact of the weaker us dollar on orders denominated in other currencies 
we include in backlog purchase orders or production releases under blanket purchase orders that have firm delivery dates 
recorded backlog in us dollars is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  recorded backlog might not result in sales because of cancellations or other factors 
most of our products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
however  other products  in particular certain magnet based products  can have significantly 
table of contents longer lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 
we believe that approximately of orders included in our backlog at october  will result in revenue before the end of fiscal year competition competition in our industries is primarily based upon the performance capabilities of products  technical support and after sales service  the manufacturer s reputation as a technological leader and product pricing 
we believe that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are characterized by the application of advanced technology 
there are numerous companies that specialize in  and a number of larger companies that devote a significant portion of their resources to  the development  manufacture  sale and service of products that compete with those that we manufacture  sell or service 
many of our competitors are well known manufacturers with a high degree of technical proficiency 
in addition  competition is intensified by the ever changing nature of the technologies in the industries in which we are engaged 
the markets for our products are characterized by specialized manufacturers that often have strength in segments or niches of these markets 
while the absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine our relative market position in our industry segments  we are one of the principal manufacturers in our primary fields 
we compete with many companies 
our scientific instruments segment competes primarily with agilent  bruker  jeol  perkinelmer  shimadzu  thermo fisher scientific  waters and other smaller suppliers 
our vacuum technologies segment competes primarily with adixen alcatel  edwards  inficon  oerlikon leybold  pfeiffer  ulvac and other smaller suppliers 
manufacturing our principal manufacturing activities consist of precision assembly  test  calibration and certain specialized machining activities 
for most of our products  we subcontract a portion of the assembly and machining  but perform all other assembly  test and calibration functions 
for some products  we have subcontracted all manufacturing operations 
we believe that the ability to manufacture reliable products in a cost effective manner is critical to meeting the just in time delivery and other demanding requirements of our oem and end user customers 
we monitor and analyze product lead times  warranty data  process yields  supplier performance  field data on mean time between failures  inventory turns  repair response times and other indicators so that we can continuously improve our manufacturing processes 
we are continuously looking for opportunities to outsource manufacturing to third parties who can provide the same quality at lower costs  and to consolidate our own manufacturing into fewer and lower cost locations 
these initiatives raise certain risks and uncertainties  which are discussed in item a risk factors restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities 
as of october   we operated significant manufacturing facilities located throughout the world 
our scientific instruments segment had manufacturing facilities in palo alto  california  walnut creek  california  lake forest  california  ft 
collins  colorado  cary  north carolina  melbourne  australia  grenoble  france  middelburg  netherlands  wroclaw  poland  church stretton  united kingdom  and yarnton  united kingdom 
our vacuum technologies segment had manufacturing facilities in lexington  massachusetts  and turin  italy 
all of our significant manufacturing facilities  other than our facility in wroclaw  poland  have been certified as complying with the international organization for standardization series quality standards iso 
raw materials our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials  electronic and mechanical components  chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies  some of which are occasionally in 
table of contents short supply 
in addition  use of certain of our products requires reliable and cost effective supply of certain raw materials 
for example  end users of our magnet based products require helium to operate those products 
helium can be  and at various times has been  difficult to source and is becoming more expensive 
if we or our customers cannot obtain sufficient quantities of helium  it could prevent us from shipping and installing superconducting magnets  which could result in our inability to recognize revenues on magnet based products 
although we have taken and will continue to take steps to reduce the volume of helium required for the manufacture and use of these products  shortages of helium could result in even higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for magnet based products  which could impact demand for those products as well as our profit margins on those products and related services 
changes in the availability or price of certain other key raw materials such as copper or components could increase our costs or our customers costs to acquire and operate our products  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we manufacture some components used in our products 
other components  including certain consumables materials and electronic components and subassemblies  are purchased from other manufacturers 
most of the raw materials  components and supplies we purchase are available from a number of different suppliers  however  a number of items such as wire used in superconducting magnets  electronic subassemblies and final assemblies used in scientific instruments are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipment of our products or increases in our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
research and development we are actively engaged in basic and applied research  development and engineering programs designed to develop new products and to improve existing products 
during fiscal years  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research  development and related engineering activities 
over this period  the focus of our research and development activities has been shifting more toward ird and consumable products 
we intend to continue to conduct extensive research and development activities  with a continued emphasis on ird products such as magnet based products  mass spectrometers including vacuum products for use in our mass spectrometers and those of other oems and certain consumable products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market new products on a cost effective and timely basis  that such products will compete favorably with products developed by others or that our existing technology will not be superseded by new discoveries or developments 
customer service and support we believe that our customer service and support are an integral part of our competitive strategy 
as part of our support services  our applications and technical support staff provides individual assistance in supporting customers specific applications needs  solving analysis problems and integrating vacuum components 
we offer training courses and periodically send our customers information on applications development 
our products generally include a day to one year warranty  but in some countries and for some products we offer longer warranties 
for most of our products  service contracts may be purchased by customers to cover equipment no longer under warranty 
service work not performed under warranty or service contract is generally performed on a time and materials basis 
we install and service our products primarily through our own field service organization  although certain distributors and sales representatives are contracted to perform some field services 
patent and other intellectual property rights we have a policy of seeking patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection in the us and other countries for developments  improvements and inventions originating within our organization that are incorporated in our products or that fall within our fields of interest 
as of october   we owned over patents in the us and over patents in other countries  and had numerous patent applications on file with various patent agencies worldwide 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate 

table of contents we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other legal  as well as contractual  restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title to protect our proprietary rights 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements frequently include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and actual and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  our compliance with these regulations is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position

risk factors overall economic conditions 
as a result of current economic uncertainties  including with respect to global capital and credit markets and overall economic growth  our customers could experience financial difficulties and as a result modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products or services or be unable to pay us on accounts receivable that are owed to the company 
in addition  our suppliers including our key suppliers  discussed below  could experience credit or other financial difficulties that could result in delays in their ability to supply us with necessary raw materials  components or finished products 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we might find it more difficult or expensive in the current economic environment to secure additional capital or credit to pursue actions we would consider beneficial to the company or our stockholders  such as acquisitions  capital investments and or repurchases of our common stock 
although we believe our cash and surplus funds are appropriately invested or in depository accounts  we could also experience losses on those investments or accounts 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
customer demand 
demand for our products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  the level of government funding for research and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market and sell these products and protect our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
variability of operating results 
we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  in part  because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems and superconducting magnets 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  which can make it difficult to anticipate  compare and measure our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
most of our products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
however  other products  in particular certain magnet based products  can have significantly longer lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 

table of contents certain of our magnet based products including nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems  nmr probes  superconducting magnets and other related components sell on long lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
certain of these systems and components sell for high prices  are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving research applications  often have customer specific features  capabilities and acceptance criteria  and can be difficult to manufacture and require long lead times 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the gross profit on these products 
changes in our effective tax rate can also create variability in our operating results 
our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries having lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries having higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities  by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof or by other discrete tax events 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense 
should actual events or results differ from our current expectations  charges against or credits to our income tax reserves and or expense may become necessary or changes in our unrecognized tax benefits could result 
any such adjustments or changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
all of this can make it difficult for us to forecast our effective tax rate 
competition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete against numerous companies  both us and non us  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  achieve economies of scale and other cost reductions  compete on price or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales or managerial activities 
some also have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than we do 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
for the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
although no single customer accounted for or more of our sales in fiscal year  we do have important customers  the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
new product development 
technological innovation and new product development are important to maintain the competitive position of our products and to grow our sales and profit margins 
we have historically dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development efforts as a means of generating new products and improving existing products  and intend to continue to conduct extensive research and development activities  with an emphasis on information rich detection products such as magnet based products  mass spectrometers including vacuum products for use in mass spectrometers and certain consumable products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to improve existing products and or develop new products on a cost effective and timely basis  that such products will compete favorably with products developed by others or that our existing technology will not be superseded by new discoveries or developments 
if we fail to improve existing products and or develop new products on a timely basis  we could experience lower revenues and or lower profit margins  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers and raw materials 
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products  including wire used in superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies used in scientific instruments  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
we are undertaking to further outsource manufacturing of certain parts  components  subsystems and even finished products  often to single sources 
disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in addition  the manufacturing and or use of certain of our products require raw materials for which supply and price can fluctuate significantly 
for example  end users of our magnet based products require helium to operate those products 
helium can be  and at various times has been  difficult to source and is becoming more expensive 
if we or our customers cannot obtain sufficient quantities of helium  it could prevent us from shipping and installing superconducting magnets  which could result in our inability to recognize revenues on magnet based products 
in addition  shortages of helium could result in even higher helium prices and thus higher operating costs for magnet based products  which could impact demand for those products 
changes in the availability or price of certain other key raw materials such as copper or components could increase our costs or our customers costs to acquire and operate our products  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
business interruption 
our facilities  operations and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes and fires  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to their limited availability  broad exclusions and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our employees based in certain countries outside of the us are subject to factory specific and or industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
of these  certain of our employees in australia are subject to collective bargaining agreements that will need to be renewed in april a work stoppage  strike or other labor action at this or other of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
our success depends on our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other third parties might claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we might also be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to mitigate these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
we have acquired companies and operations and made minority equity investments in private companies  and intend to acquire companies and operations and make minority equity investments in private companies in the future  as part of our growth strategy 
these acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  integrating data systems  assessing and if necessary implementing or improving internal control over financial reporting and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
with respect to minority equity investments  we often have limited ability to control how their business is conducted 
additionally  acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets and minority equity investments in private companies are subject to regular impairment testing and potential impairment charges 
for all of these reasons  minority 
table of contents equity investments or our failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities 
we have undertaken restructuring activities such as our northern california manufacturing consolidation and other efficiency improvement activities such as our global procurement  lower cost manufacturing and outsourcing initiatives  and have announced and may undertake similar activities in the future  that we expect to result in certain costs and eventual cost savings 
these costs and cost savings are based on estimates at the time of plan commitment as to the timing of activities to be completed and the timing and amount of related costs to be incurred 
we could experience delays  business disruptions and employee turnover in connection with restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities and our estimates of the costs to complete and savings achieved by these activities could change 
as a result  these activities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
non us operations 
a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  customers  suppliers and employees are outside of the us as a result  we are subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers or profit repatriations  import  export and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  as well as us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act as they relate to our non us operations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
currency exchange rates 
the us dollar value of our sales and product and operating costs varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order of magnitude  our sales are mainly denominated in us dollars  euros  british pounds and japanese yen  while our costs are mainly denominated in us dollars  euros  australian dollars and british pounds 
because we manufacture and sell in the us and many other countries  the impact that currency exchange rate fluctuations have on us is dependent on the interaction of a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the relationships between various foreign currencies  the relative amount of our revenues and costs that are denominated in us dollars or in us dollar linked currencies  customer resistance to currency driven price changes and the suddenness and severity of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge most of our balance sheet exposures denominated in other than local currencies based upon forecasts of those exposures  in the event that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  foreign exchange losses could result 
for all of these reasons  currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk 
we extend trade credit to many of our customers 
we generally perform credit evaluations of these customers before extending credit 
to some extent  we utilize letters of credit to mitigate credit risks 
while we believe that we take appropriate steps to manage customer credit risk  our customers could experience financial difficulties  in particular given current economic conditions  that could result in delays or difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable that are owed to the company 
this could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have cash and surplus funds that we invest  primarily in demand deposits  short term us treasury securities and money market funds 
we also purchase foreign exchange forward contracts in order to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations  which contracts are placed primarily with major financial institutions 
we also accept letters of credit from financial institutions to ensure payment for sales of our products 
although we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our foreign exchange forward contracts and letters of credit provided to us  are invested or placed with secure financial institutions  there is no assurance that these financial institutions will not default on their obligations to us  especially given global financial market conditions 
loss of principal on demand deposits or invested funds or a default on a foreign exchange forward contract or letter of credit could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales and 
table of contents management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel and the cost to attract  motivate and retain them can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 
in addition  certain employees have significant institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
certain employee benefit plans 
many of our us employees participate in health care plans under which we are self insured 
we maintain a stop loss insurance policy that covers the cost of certain individually large claims under these plans 
each year  our expenses under these plans are recorded based on actuarial estimates of the number and costs of expected claims  administrative costs and stop loss premiums 
these estimates are then adjusted at the end of each plan year to reflect actual costs incurred 
actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics  the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims 
in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we also maintain defined benefit pension plans for our employees in several countries outside of the us in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  we utilize a number of assumptions including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine our defined benefit pension plan costs each year 
these assumptions are set based on relevant long term debt  equity and other market conditions in the countries in which the plans are maintained 
we adjust these assumptions each year in response to corresponding changes in underlying market conditions and expectations 
changes in these market conditions and expectations result in corresponding changes in our defined benefit pension plan assumptions  liabilities and costs 
we could also curtail these plans  which could result in us incurring curtailment settlement charges 
in addition  changes in relevant government regulations in the countries in which our defined benefit pension plans are located and or changes in the accounting rules applicable to these plans including sfas could also impact our defined benefit pension plan liabilities and costs 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that our compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as is described in item business  we and vsea are each obligated under the terms of the distribution agreement to indemnify vms for one third of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to a environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by vai and third party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities  and b us environmental protection agency or third party claims alleging that vai or vms is a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla in connection with certain sites to which vai allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment or disposal the cercla sites 
with respect to the facilities formerly operated by vai  vms is overseeing the environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation activities  in most cases under the direction of  or in consultation with  federal  state and or local agencies  and handling third party claims 
vms is also handling claims relating to the cercla sites 
we are also undertaking environmental investigation  and or monitoring activities at one of our facilities under the direction of or in consultation with governmental agencies 
various uncertainties make it difficult to estimate future costs for certain of these environmental related activities  specifically external legal expenses  vms internal oversight costs  third party claims and 
table of contents a former vai facility where the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities are difficult to assess 
as of october   it was nonetheless estimated that our future exposure for these environmental related costs ranged in the aggregate from million to million 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each type of cost  ranging up to approximately years as of october  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is discounted  and no amount in the range is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range 
we therefore had an accrual of million as of october  for these future environmental related costs 
sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate other costs of future environmental related activities 
as of october   it was estimated that our future costs for these environmental related activities ranged in the aggregate from million to million 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies  ranging up to approximately years as of october  as to each of these ranges of cost estimates  it was determined that a particular amount within the range was a better estimate than any other amount within the range 
together  these amounts totaled million at october  because both the amount and timing of the recurring portion of these costs were reliably determinable  that portion is discounted at  net of inflation 
we therefore had an accrual of million as of october   which represents our best estimate of these future environmental related costs after discounting estimated recurring future costs 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 
at october   our reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by us as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future cost in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring and remediation activities are being undertaken 
we have not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
however  an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs  for which we have an indemnification obligation  and we therefore have a long term receivable of million discounted at  net of inflation in other assets as of october  for our share of that insurance recovery 
management believes that our reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of our obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified and related charges against or credits to earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from 
table of contents environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  management believes that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
governmental regulations 
our businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  costs to comply with new or changed regulations could be significant  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines  other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the european union eu adopted directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive and directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the weee directive requires eu member countries to adopt implementing legislation imposing certain responsibilities on producers manufacturers and importers in the eu of electrical and electronic equipment with respect to the collection and disposal of waste from that equipment and the rohs directive bans in the eu the use of certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment 
all eu member countries where we manufacture or import products have adopted implementing legislation under these directives 
as a result of the weee directive  we are incurring or will incur waste collection and disposal costs to comply with implementing legislation under the weee directive  these costs have not been significant to date and we do not expect them to be significant in the future  but if they are  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the rohs directive  certain raw materials and components sourced from third parties are no longer available  or will in the future become unavailable  for use in the manufacture of the company s products  we have not experienced significant supply disruptions and have not incurred significant costs as a result of the rohs directive and we do not expect such disruptions or costs to be significant in the future  but if they are  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  legislation similar to the weee and rohs directives have been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu such as china  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year segment results for financial reporting purposes  our operations are grouped into two reportable business segments scientific instruments and vacuum technologies 
the following table presents comparisons of our sales and operating earnings for each of those segments and in total for fiscal years and fiscal year ended increase decrease october  september  of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total company operating earnings by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total segments general corporate total company scientific instruments 
the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volume across a broad range of our analytical instruments and consumable products  partially offset by lower sales of research products 
sales increased for environmental  energy and life science applications 
during fiscal year  the us dollar weakened compared to most other foreign currencies in which the company sells products and services  which also contributed to the increase in sales 
excluding sales from businesses acquired in fiscal year  scientific instruments sales in the fiscal year increased by approximately compared to fiscal year scientific instruments operating earnings for fiscal year include an acquisition related in process research and development charge of million  acquisition related intangible amortization of million  amortization of million related to inventory written up to fair value in connection with acquisitions  restructuring and other related costs of million and share based compensation expense of million

excluding the impact of these items  
table of contents operating earnings were lower as a percentage of sales due to higher transition costs related to the relocation of manufacturing activities for certain products  the weaker us dollar which was favorable to reported sales but unfavorable to reported operating margins and higher costs relating to new product introductions 
these factors more than offset the positive impact of sales volume leverage 
vacuum technologies 
the increase in vacuum technologies sales was driven by higher sales volume over a broad range of products and services and the positive impact of the weaker us dollar 
vacuum technologies operating earnings for fiscal years and include share based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
excluding the impact of this item  the decrease in vacuum technologies operating earnings as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of the weaker us dollar  which was only partially offset by the positive impact of sales volume leverage

as discussed under the heading segment results above  sales by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments in fiscal year increased by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year the growth in consolidated sales was broad based  with increases in sales of products for environmental  energy and life science applications 
the weaker us dollar and acquisitions also had a positive effect on the reported sales increases 
excluding sales from businesses acquired in fiscal year  sales in fiscal year increased by approximately compared to fiscal year for geographic reporting purposes  we refer to four regions north america excluding mexico  europe including the middle east and africa  asia pacific including india and latin america including mexico 

table of contents sales by geographic region in fiscal years and were as follows fiscal year ended increase decrease october  september  of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific latin america total company the increases in sales in europe  asia pacific and north america were attributable to higher sales by both the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments

in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year include million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
excluding the impact of these items  the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of sales volume leverage and lower employee bonus accruals  largely offset by the weaker us dollar and higher costs relating to new product introductions 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal year include million in restructuring and other related costs and share based compensation expense of million 
in comparison  research and development expenses for fiscal year include million in restructuring and other related costs and share based compensation expense of million

purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the oxford diffraction acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a one time charge of million to immediately expense acquired in process research and development related to projects that were in process but incomplete at the time of the acquisition 
restructuring activities 
between fiscal years and  we committed to several restructuring plans in order to adjust our organizational structure  improve operational efficiencies and or eliminate redundant or excess costs resulting from acquisitions or dispositions during those periods 
we have incurred a total of million in restructuring expense under these restructuring plans 

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in our aggregate liability during fiscal year relating to all restructuring plans employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at october  in addition  we have also recorded other costs related directly to these plans comprised primarily of employee retention and relocation costs and accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities totaling million 
of this amount  a total of million was recorded during fiscal year fiscal year plan 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we committed to a plan to combine and optimize the development and assembly of most of our nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry products  to further centralize related administration and other functions and to reallocate certain resources toward more rapidly growing product lines and geographies 
as part of the plan  we are creating an information rich detection ird center in walnut creek  california  where certain nmr operations located in palo alto  california will be integrated with mass spectrometry operations already located in walnut creek 
merging our ird talent base into this single location will capitalize on our strength in nmr and mass spectrometry  and enhance our ability to develop innovative ird solutions that are more powerful  complementary  routine and user friendly 
underscoring our commitment to ird and the benefits that a combined location and organization will provide  we are investing in a new  square foot building and a substantial remodel of an existing building there to house the ird center 
as a result of the plan  a number of employee positions have been or will be relocated or eliminated and certain facilities will be consolidated 
these actions primarily impact the scientific instruments segment and involve the elimination of between approximately and positions 
we expect these activities to be completed by the end of fiscal year restructuring and other related costs associated with this plan include one time termination benefits  retention payments  costs to relocate facilities including decommissioning costs  moving costs and temporary facility storage costs  accelerated depreciation of fixed assets to be disposed as a result of facilities actions and lease termination costs 
these costs are currently estimated to be between million and million  of which million was incurred in fiscal year and million was incurred in fiscal year the estimated remaining costs are expected to be settled through the second quarter of fiscal year except for certain lease termination related costs  which might be settled as late as the fourth quarter of fiscal year costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan have been included in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year relating to the foregoing plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at october  
table of contents the restructuring charges of million recorded during fiscal year related to employee termination benefits and costs associated with the closure of leased facilities 
we also incurred million in other related costs during fiscal year  which were comprised of million in employee retention costs and million in facilities related costs including decommissioning costs and a non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities 
since the inception of this plan  we have recorded million in related restructuring expense and million of other related costs 
upon its completion  the plan is expected to result in certain operational improvements and efficiencies  which we anticipate will result in a reduction of our overall cost structure and annual operating expenses 
fiscal year plan 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we committed to a plan to reduce our employee headcount in order to reduce operating costs and increase margins 
the plan involves the termination of approximately employees  mostly located in europe  and will result in pretax restructuring and other related costs totaling between million and million 
these costs will relate primarily to one time termination benefits 
we currently anticipate that these costs will be recorded and that the related actions will be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal year the restructuring costs include no non cash components and are expected to be settled by the end of fiscal year restructuring cost savings 
when they were initiated  each of the foregoing restructuring plans was expected to eventually result in a reduction in annual operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the estimated annual cost savings for each plan as well as where those cost savings were expected to be realized restructuring plan estimated annual cost savings fiscal year plan scientific instruments to combine and optimize the development and assembly on certain products and to centralize functions and reallocate resources to rapidly growing product lines million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments to reduce headcount and operating costs and increase operating margins million million these estimated cost savings are expected to impact cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
some of these cost savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in other parts of our business  for example  as part of our continued emphasis on ird and consumable products 
in addition  unrelated cost increases in other areas of our operations have and could in the future offset some or all of these cost savings 
although it is difficult to quantify with any precision our actual cost savings to date from these activities  many of which are still ongoing  we currently believe that the ultimate savings realized will not differ materially from these estimates 
impairment of private company equity investment 
during fiscal year  we became aware of information which raised substantial doubt about the ability of a small  private company in which we hold a cost method equity investment to continue as a going concern 
based on this information  we determined that the fair value of our investment had declined and that the decline was other than temporary 
as a result  we wrote off the entire million carrying value via an impairment charge during fiscal year income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the higher effective income tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to higher us state taxes  higher us taxes on distributable foreign earnings  higher non deductible compensation expense and a non deductible in process research and development charge related to an acquisition 
these factors were partially offset by the benefit from a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of certain statutes of limitations in fiscal year and lower taxes on retained foreign earnings 
net earnings 
net earnings for fiscal year included a non deductible in process research and development charge of million and the after tax impacts of an impairment of a private company equity investment of million  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up to fair value in connection with recent acquisitions  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
net earnings for fiscal year included the after tax impacts of million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up to fair value in connection with 
table of contents the acquisition of ionspec  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
excluding the after tax impact of these items  the increase in net earnings in fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher sales volume including sales volume leverage on operating expenses  partially offset by higher transition costs related to the relocation of manufacturing activities for certain products and higher costs relating to new product introductions

as discussed under the heading segment results above  sales by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments in fiscal year increased by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year on a consolidated basis  sales grew in fiscal year  with strong growth into environmental  energy  and applied research and other applications and modest growth into life science applications 
revenues for fiscal year do not include sales for the full twelve months from polymer labs  which was acquired in november excluding the impact of polymer labs  sales in fiscal year increased by approximately compared to fiscal year sales by geographic region in fiscal years and were as follows fiscal year ended increase decrease september  september  of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific latin america total company the increases in sales in europe  asia pacific and latin america were primarily attributable to stronger demand across a broad range of our products  in particular analytical instruments and vacuum products 
the weaker us dollar also had a positive effect on the reported sales increases in these regions 
in europe  higher sales of research products also contributed to the increase 
we believe the reduction in sales in north america was primarily due to a general trend in many industries of manufacturing moving out of the us for cost and tax reasons  which was in part due to consolidations and a shift in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing to the asia pacific region 
while this trend negatively impacted sales in north america in fiscal year  it probably benefited us in asia pacific 

table of contents in addition to the factors described above  the sales decrease in north america and increase in europe compared to fiscal year were both more pronounced  and the sales increase in asia pacific was less pronounced  due to the timing of sales of certain low volume  high selling price research products 
we do not consider these geographic shifts to be indicative of any particular trend for research products as a whole  but rather to be reflective of the variability in results that these low volume  high selling price research products can create 
gross profit

selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal year primarily as a result of sales volume leverage and efficiency improvements resulting from cost reduction activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal year include million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
in comparison  research and development expenses for fiscal year include share based compensation expense of million 
excluding the impact of these items  research and development expenses were slightly lower as a percentage of sales due to sales volume leverage 
in absolute dollars  the increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the acquisitions of polymer labs in the first quarter of fiscal year and ionspec in the second quarter of fiscal year and higher spending on new product development primarily for information rich detection products 
restructuring activities 
between fiscal years and  we committed to several restructuring plans in order to adjust our organizational structure  improve operational efficiencies and or eliminate redundant or excess costs resulting from acquisitions or dispositions during those periods 
we have incurred a total of million in restructuring expense under these restructuring plans 
the following table sets forth changes in our aggregate liability during fiscal year relating to all restructuring plans employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  in addition  we have also recorded other costs related directly to these plans comprised primarily of employee retention and relocation costs and accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities totaling million 
of this amount  a total of million was recorded during fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year plan 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability relating to the fiscal year plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense  net cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  the restructuring charges of million recorded during fiscal year related to employee termination benefits 
in addition  we incurred million in other costs relating directly to this restructuring plan during fiscal year these costs were comprised of a million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities as well as million in employee retention costs and million in other facility related costs  both of which will be settled in cash 
interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash balances and higher rates of interest on those balances during fiscal year compared to fiscal year income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the lower effective income tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to a net reduction of million in tax reserves resulting from the positive outcome of tax uncertainties during that period  partially offset by the negative impact of a million non deductible in process research and development charge recorded during the same period 
net earnings 
net earnings for fiscal year include million in share based compensation expense  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in amortization related to inventory written up to fair value in connection with recent acquisitions 
net earnings for fiscal year include million in share based compensation expense  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up to fair value in connection with recent acquisitions  million in restructuring and other related costs and an in process research and development charge of million 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in net earnings in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher sales volume and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
outlook we completed our fourth quarter and fiscal year with sound orders  revenues  net earnings and cash flow  and believe that we are well positioned  with a broad portfolio of products and applications  several recently released new products  an agile global distribution network  a recurring stream of after sales revenue and  if they hold  favorable currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
however  we are concerned by increasingly negative economic indicators and the likelihood that economic conditions will get significantly worse and have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
these conditions present significant uncertainties that make it difficult for us to project our near term results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
the following is a summary of what we consider to be our most critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied and the judgments made in their application 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from product sales including accessory sales and services 
we recognize revenue on product sales and accessory sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
product sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  but that do involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and subsequently recognized when the installation is complete 
for certain other product sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is deferred until all contractually required customer acceptance provisions and product specifications have been satisfied 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue related to incident based paid service and training services is recognized when the related services are provided to the customer 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
sales arrangements involving undelivered elements are primarily confined to the scientific instruments segment and involve product accessories  installation services and or training services that are delivered after the related product has been delivered 
product accessories generally enhance the functionality of the product but are not essential to the functionality of the product 
in determining relative fair values for product accessories and training services  we utilize published price list values as the basis for allocating the overall arrangement consideration 
list prices are representative of fair value  as stand alone sales of products  product accessories and training have occurred at list price 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
estimates of installation hours have historically been accurate 
in limited cases  product accessories ordered by customers may not have an established list price  as the item may be a new or slightly modified accessory with no prior sales history 
in these limited cases  we consider whether a comparable or substitute accessory that provides similar functionality exists for which fair value has been established and then use that comparable or substitute accessory s list price in estimating the fair value of the undelivered elements 
if such conditions do not exist  all arrangement revenue is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered  however  such cases are infrequent and arise from a significant technological advance that creates products or product accessories without a suitable comparable or substitute accessory from which to derive fair value 
we determine when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on our best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and our judgment of when our performance obligations have been met as outlined above 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we sell our products and extend trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of our total revenues or trade accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically been insignificant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent our best estimates and are based on our judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on our best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  
table of contents industry and market trends and conditions and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  increases to inventory reserves might become necessary 
product warranty 
our products are generally subject to warranties and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement through charges to cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on our best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in our warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully in item business and item a risk factors environmental matters  we entered into a distribution agreement in connection with becoming a separate  public company on april  under the terms of that distribution agreement  we are obligated to indemnify varian medical systems  inc vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by us relating to these matters are based on our best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from our current expectations and best estimates  changes to our reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
share based compensation 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
under sfas r  we estimate the value of share based payments on the date of grant using the black scholes model  which was also used previously for the purpose of providing pro forma financial information as required under sfas the determination of the fair value of  and the timing of expense relating to  share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables including the expected term of awards  expected stock price volatility and expected forfeitures 
in determining the company s expected stock price volatility assumption  the company reviews both the historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock  with implied volatility based on publicly traded options on the company s common stock 
unless the volume or maturity of these publicly traded options does not satisfy the conditions to use implied volatility under sab  we determine the expected stock price volatility assumptions using a combination of historical and implied volatility 
sfas r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate expected forfeitures  as well as the expected term of awards  based on historical experience 
future changes in these assumptions  our stock price or certain other factors could result in changes in our share based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside of the us significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes as well as in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  as well as reserves for related potential penalties and interest  based on the technical merits of our tax positions and the extent to which  additional taxes  penalties and interest will be due 
these unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions can be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
these balances are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our income tax expense includes the impact of new unrecognized tax benefits recorded as well as changes to existing unrecognized tax benefits that are considered appropriate 
should the ultimate resolution of any tax related uncertainties including any which may be currently unidentified differ from those we used to determine our recorded liabilities  charges against or credits to our unrecognized tax benefits and or income tax provision will become necessary 

table of contents our judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets are based on  among other things  the relative weight of both positive and negative evidence regarding future taxable income  and may change due to changes in market conditions  tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
should our assumptions and consequently our estimates in this area change in the future  the amount of valuation allowances recorded relating to our deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased  which would result in charges against or credits to our income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  compared to million generated in fiscal year cash generated from operating activities decreased primarily due to relative increases in inventories million and accounts receivable million 
the relative increase in inventories was primarily due to a build up of inventory to support increased orders  new product introductions and the transition of certain products to new manufacturing locations  while the relative increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to a higher sales volume during fiscal year we used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million used for investing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was primarily the result of the acquisitions of the analogix business in november and oxford diffraction in april as well as higher net capital expenditures due primarily to the construction of our ird center in walnut creek  california 
we used million of cash for financing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million used for financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to higher expenditures to repurchase and retire common stock such expenditures were made in both periods as a result of a continued effort to utilize excess cash to reduce the number of outstanding common shares  lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to lower stock option exercise volume and higher repayments of debt 
we maintain relationships with banks in many countries from which we sometimes obtain bank guarantees and short term standby letters of credit 
these guarantees and letters of credit relate primarily to advance payments and deposits made to our subsidiaries by customers for which separate liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
as of october   a total of million of these bank guarantees and letters of credit were outstanding 
no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these or any other outstanding guarantees or letters of credit as of that date 
as of october   we had an million term loan outstanding with a us financial institution 
the balance outstanding under this term loan was million at september  as of both october  and september   the fixed interest rate on the term loan was 
the term loan contains certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating results 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreement at october  in connection with certain acquisitions  we have accrued a portion of the purchase price that has been retained to secure the respective sellers indemnification obligations 
as of october   we had retained an aggregate of million  which will become payable net of any indemnification claims between april and november in addition to the above amounts  the final million retained in connection with the acquisition of ionspec in february was paid during fiscal year as of october   we had several outstanding contingent consideration arrangements relating to acquired businesses 
amounts subject to these arrangements can be earned over the respective measurement period  depending on the performance of the acquired business relative to certain financial and or operational targets 

table of contents the following table summarizes contingent consideration arrangements as of october  acquired business remaining amount available maximum measurement period measurement period end date in millions pl international ltd 
years december ionspec corporation years april oxford diffraction years april analogix business years december other years july total during fiscal year  we paid million for the final contingent consideration payment related to magnex scientific limited  which we acquired in november the distribution agreement provides that we are responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party  and further provides that we will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of october   we had cancelable commitments to a contractor for capital expenditures totaling approximately million relating to the construction of our ird center in walnut creek  california 
in the event that these commitments are canceled for reasons other than the contractor s default  we may be responsible for reimbursement of actual costs incurred by the contractor 
we had no material non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures as of october  in the aggregate  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately to of sales in fiscal year as discussed above under the heading restructuring activities  in april  we committed to a plan to combine and optimize the development and assembly of most of our nmr and mass spectrometry products  to further centralize related administration and other functions and to reallocate certain resources toward more rapidly growing product lines and geographies 
in connection with this plan  we expect to make capital expenditures of up to million  of which million has been spent through october  these capital expenditures began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and will continue through fiscal year we also expect to incur total restructuring and other related costs associated with this plan of between million and million  of which million was incurred in fiscal year and million was incurred in fiscal year some portion of these costs is expected to be settled through the fourth quarter of fiscal year  except for certain lease termination related costs  which might be settled as late as the fourth quarter of fiscal year a total of million to million of these costs are expected to result in cash expenditures  of which a total of million was paid in fiscal year and million was paid in fiscal year in october  we entered into an agreement with vms under which we agreed to surrender to them for million the sublease for our facility in palo alto  california 
we received million of the amount payable under this agreement in the first quarter of fiscal year and will receive the remaining million when we fully vacate the facility in the third quarter of fiscal year in february  our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to utilize up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program is effective through december  during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired  shares under this authorization at an aggregate cost of million 
as of october   we had remaining authorization to repurchase million of our common stock under this repurchase program 
in january  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to utilize up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program was effective until december  during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired  shares under this repurchase program at an aggregate cost of million  which completed this repurchase program 

table of contents our liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and others related to the uncertainties of the industries and economies in which we operate 
our liquidity has not been materially affected by the recent deterioration in the global financial markets or global economic conditions in general 
however  this deterioration has adversely impacted the availability and cost of credit to us as well as our customers and suppliers 
we have no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates or investment valuations 
we invest our excess cash primarily in depository accounts  short term us treasury securities and money market funds 
our outstanding debt carries a fixed interest rate 
while we have not historically needed to borrow to support working capital or capital expenditure requirements  there is no assurance that we might not need to borrow to support these requirements given global economic uncertainties 
this could also adversely affect our ability to complete acquisitions and repurchase our common stock 
notwithstanding the above  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our current cash and cash equivalents balances and current borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that credit will be available to us if and when needed 
future operating performance and our ability to obtain credit will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the amount and estimated timing of future cash expenditures relating to principal payments on outstanding long term debt  minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases and other long term liabilities as of october  fiscal years thereafter total in thousands operating leases long term debt including current portion other long term liabilities total as of october   we did not have any off balance sheet commercial commitments that could result in a significant cash outflow upon the occurrence of some contingent event  except for contingent payments of up to a maximum of million related to acquisitions as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  the specific amounts of which are not currently determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to previous accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with certain exceptions which are described below 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement  which amends sfas to exclude certain leasing transactions from its scope 
also in february  the fasb issued fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november   except for items that are 
table of contents recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement  which provides companies with an option to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities in their entirety at fair value 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  and may be applied only to entire instruments 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in the item s fair value must be reported as unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the options provided under sfas and their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations if implemented 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations  sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations but also provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
it also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas r also requires that certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations  which previously were adjusted to goodwill  must be adjusted to income tax expense  regardless of the date of the original business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and do not expect its adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  in the event that we complete acquisitions subsequent to our adoption of sfas r  the application of its provisions will likely have a material impact on our results of operations  although we are not currently able to estimate that impact 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and the amount of consolidated net income be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires once a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements are applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which requires additional disclosures about the objectives and strategies of the derivative instruments and hedging activities  the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas and its related interpretations  and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial condition and results of operations 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r  business combinations  and other accounting literature 
fsp is effective for fiscal 
table of contents years beginning after december  and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
given that fsp applies to intangible assets acquired after the effective date  we are not able to determine whether its adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on forecasted transactions 
the success of our hedging activities depends on our ability to forecast balance sheet exposures and transaction activity in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  we believe that in most cases any such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
we therefore believe that the direct effect of an immediate change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and all other currencies is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
at october   there were no outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
during the fiscal year ended october   no foreign exchange gains or losses from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness were recognized 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
a summary of all foreign exchange forward contracts that were outstanding as of october  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands australian dollar euro british pound japanese yen swedish krona canadian dollar korean won total interest rate risk 
we have no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we enter into debt obligations principally to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
at october   our debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amount of long term debt approximates the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases

table of contents defined benefit retirement plans 
most of our retirement plans  including all us based plans  are defined contribution plans 
however  we also provide defined benefit pension plans in certain countries outside of the us our obligations under these defined benefit plans will ultimately be settled in the future and are therefore subject to estimation 
defined benefit pension accounting under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended  is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees estimated service periods based on the terms of the pension plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we make assumptions regarding several variables including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine defined benefit pension plan expense for the year 
this expense is referred to as net periodic pension cost 
we assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumption for each defined benefit plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by sfas and make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
on an annual basis  we analyze the rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used and determine that these rates are reasonable 
for rates of return  this analysis is based on a review of the nature of the underlying assets  the allocation of those assets and their historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the related plans are effective 
historically  our assumed asset allocations have not varied significantly from the actual allocations 
discount rates are based on the prevailing market long term interest rates in the countries where the related plans are effective 
as of october   the estimated long term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets ranged from to weighted average of  and the assumed discount rate for our defined benefit pension plan obligations ranged from to weighted average of 
if any of these assumptions were to change  our net periodic pension cost would also change 
we incurred net periodic pension cost relating to our defined benefit pension plans of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  and expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately million in fiscal year a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated return on plan assets or assumed discount rate would increase our net periodic pension cost for fiscal year by million or million  respectively 
as of october   our projected benefit obligation relating to defined benefit pension plans was million 
a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated discount rate would increase this obligation by million
