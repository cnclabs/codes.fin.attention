item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office  healthcare and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of more than million square feet  and owned or jointly controlled approximately  acres of unencumbered land with an estimated future development potential of more than million square feet of industrial  office  healthcare and retail properties 
we provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures property leasing  property management  asset management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
management philosophy and priorities our key business and financial strategies for the future include the following one of our primary business objectives is to increase funds from operations ffo by i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets  iii expanding geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets  iv using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  v developing and repositioning properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through our service operations property sale program  and vi providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies 
additionally  we employ a capital recycling program where we utilize sales of operating real estate assets that no longer fit our strategies to generate proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our current and longer term strategies 
this strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities 
we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii pursuing current and future long term debt financings and refinancing generally on an unsecured basis  iv maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios  v generating proceeds from the sale of non strategic properties and vi issuing perpetual preferred stock for of our total capital structure 
year in review during  we continued the execution of our strategy to improve our portfolio of held for investment buildings through our capital recycling program  increasing our development pipeline to over billion  and continuing geographic expansion that we anticipate will provide future earnings growth 
as a result of these accomplishments  we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available for common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended ffo available to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in industry analysts and investors use ffo as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management believes ffo is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo provides a useful comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands net income available for common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture minority interest share of adjustments funds from operations we continued strategic initiatives to expand geographically  recycle capital from the disposition of operating properties  and create value by leveraging our development  construction and management capabilities as follows as part of our continuing strategy to expand into new markets  we entered the southern california  seattle and eastern virginia markets in this follows our geographic expansion initiatives in into the washington  dc  baltimore  phoenix and houston markets 
throughout  we completed land acquisitions totaling million while generating proceeds of million from the disposition of other land parcels 
of our total undeveloped land inventory  million was placed under development during as construction activity commenced 
in february  we continued our expansion into the health care real estate market by completing the acquisition of bremner healthcare real estate bremner  a national health care development and management firm 
the initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled million  and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over the next three years 
we disposed of non strategic wholly owned held for rental properties for million of gross proceeds 
additionally  unconsolidated subsidiaries disposed of properties of which our share of the gross proceeds totaled million 
these transactions were a continuation of our long term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments 
we disposed of properties  which were developed with the intent to sell  for million of gross proceeds and recognized pre tax gains on sale of million 
we will continue to develop long term assets to be held in our portfolio and develop assets to be sold upon  or soon after  completion 
with over billion which includes million of third party construction backlog in our development pipeline at december   we are encouraged about the long term growth opportunities in our business 
newly developed properties  with a basis of million and occupancy of at december   were placed in service during the year 
we achieved record leasing activity in with approximately million square feet of new leases and approximately million square feet of lease renewals 
we have continued to maintain a high occupancy level during this year of portfolio expansion as the overall occupancy percentage of on our in service held for rental portfolio was consistent with the level of 
highlights of our key financing activities in are as follows we had million outstanding on our lines of credit as of december  during  the borrowing capacity on our line of credit was increased from billion to billion while maintaining the interest rate of libor plus basis points 
we issued million of unsecured notes at an effective interest rate of 
we retired million of unsecured notes with a weighted average effective interest rate of in october  we issued million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in october  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a liquidation amount of million 
we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from moody s investors service baa and standard poor s ratings group bbb 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness was at december  compared to at december  key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial  office  and healthcare properties rental operations 
the following discussion highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical for future revenue growth 
all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures 
occupancy analysis as discussed above  our ability to maintain favorable occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations

we renewed and of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately million and million square feet in and  respectively 
we attained growth in net effective rents on these renewals during our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate 
we do not presently expect this renewal percentage in to differ from the past three years 
development another source of growth in earnings is the development of additional properties 
these properties should provide future earnings through income upon sale or from rental operations income as they are placed in service 
we had million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of billion at december   compared to million square feet and total costs of billion at december  we have increased our development pipeline during and will continue to pursue additional development opportunities  while focusing on pre leasing as we closely monitor the strength of the national and local market economies 
the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data anticipated in service date square feet percent leased project costs anticipated stabilized return held for rental buildings st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter service operations buildings st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter total acquisition and disposition activity we continued to selectively dispose of non strategic properties in gross sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties were million  which included the disposition of a portfolio of eight office properties in the cleveland market and a portfolio of twelve industrial properties in the st 
louis market 
our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures  in which we have less than a interest  totaled million 
in  proceeds totaled million for the disposition of wholly owned held for rental properties and million for our share of property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures 
dispositions of wholly owned properties developed for sale rather than rental resulted in million in proceeds in compared to million in we intend to continue to identify properties for disposition in order to recycle the proceeds into higher yielding assets 
the level of dispositions will be impacted by the ability of the prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing given the current state of the capital markets 
in  in addition to the acquisition of bremner  we acquired million of income producing properties and million of undeveloped land compared to million of income producing properties and million of undeveloped land in results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share data rental operations revenues from continuing operations service operations revenues from continuing operations earnings from continuing rental operations earnings from continuing service operations operating income net income available for common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares and potential dilutive common equivalents basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental revenue from continuing operations overall  rental revenue from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands office industrial other total both of our reportable segments that comprise rental operations office and industrial are within the real estate industry  however  the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment in the same manner 
the primary causes of the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired six new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of million and million  respectively 
acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in we acquired an additional properties in and later contributed them to an unconsolidated joint venture  resulting in a million reduction in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in of these properties  were contributed in the fourth quarter of  seven were contributed in the second quarter of and one was contributed in the fourth quarter of rental revenue includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees increased from million in to million in the remaining increase in rental revenues is primarily the result of an million increase in revenues from reimbursable rental expenses 
this increase is largely offset by a corresponding increase in overall rental expenses 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties 
these earnings decreased from million in to million in during  our joint ventures sold non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million  compared to ten joint venture building sales in  with million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of the net gains 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial other total real estate taxes office industrial other total of the overall million increase in rental expenses in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  this increase was largely offset by a reduction in rental expenses of million resulting from the contribution of properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in and inclement weather conditions in the first quarter of  an increase in utility rates and volume in the third quarter of due to unseasonably high temperatures and normal inflationary factors triggered the remaining increase in rental expenses 
of the overall million increase in real estate taxes in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  the remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in assessments in some of our markets 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations remained fairly consistent from to at million in  compared to million in while we maintained higher outstanding borrowings in compared to  these higher borrowings were used to fund our increase in development activities and thus  the increased interest costs from these borrowings were capitalized into project costs rather than expensed 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in due to increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during and service operations service operations primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell within a short period of time and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners 
earnings from service operations decreased slightly from million in to million in the following are the factors related to the decrease in earnings from service operations in our service operations building development and sales program  whereby a building is developed or repositioned by us and then sold soon after completion  is a significant component of earnings from operations and is often a significant driver of fluctuations in earnings from service operations between periods 
during  we generated pre tax gains of million from the sale of properties compared to million from the sale of nine properties in partially offsetting the aforementioned decrease was a million reduction in income taxes on these gains on sale  with the net effect of decreased gains on sale in resulting in a million decrease in earnings from service operations 
increased net general contractor revenues drove a million increase in earnings from service operations from as the result of increased volume and margins and favorable settlement of previously existing warranty reserves 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses are comprised of two components 
the first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees  audit fees  marketing costs  investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead 
the second component is the unallocated indirect costs determined to be unrelated to the operation of our owned properties and service operations 
those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
there was a million increase in the overall pool of overhead costs in that was necessitated by our overall growth 
the majority of this increase in the overall pool of overhead costs was necessary as the result of increased rental and service operations activity and thus  was allocated to rental operations  construction  development and leasing 
approximately million of the aforementioned increase in the overall overhead pool was not allocated to operations  which was the primary reason for the overall million increase to general and administrative expense 
discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense  depreciation expense and minority interest  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
we classified the operations of properties as discontinued operations as of december  these properties consist of industrial  office and one retail property 
as a result  we classified net income from operations  net of minority interest  of million  million and million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  were sold during  properties were sold during  properties were sold during  and operating properties are classified as held for sale at december  the gains on disposal of these properties  net of impairment adjustment and minority interest  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations

the primary causes of the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended compared to as they provided incremental revenues of million and million respectively 
these acquisitions totaled million on million square feet and were leased at december  acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in rental revenue includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees increased from million in to million in our in service occupancy increased from at december   to at december  and contributed to the remaining increase in rental revenue 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties 
these earnings increased from million in to million in during  our joint ventures sold non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million 
during the second quarter of  one of our ventures sold three buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million

interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in  as a result of the following interest costs on the unsecured line of credit increased by million from as the result of increased borrowings throughout the year  as well as increased interest rates 
interest costs on unsecured notes increased by million as the result of an overall increase in borrowings used mainly to fund acquisitions and development 
interest costs on secured debt increased by million as the result of the increase in borrowings in offsetting the above increases  capitalized interest increased by million as the result of increased development activities 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in as the result of increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during and service operations service operations primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell within a short period of time and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties

during  we generated pre tax gains of million from the sale of nine properties compared to million from the sale of ten properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
partially offsetting the increased gains from our service operations building development and sales program was the effect of a decreased focus on third party construction services as well as the fact that in the first quarter of  we recognized million of a non recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses are comprised of two components

those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from was largely attributable to an increase in our overall pool of overhead costs to support our current and anticipated future growth 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities  we further assess under the guidelines of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop  accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests generally ranging from to in unconsolidated joint ventures that develop  own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary 
for non variable interest entities  we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing member and our partner does not have substantive participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
in accordance with the provisions of sop and sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate investments we evaluate our real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered to be impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we utilize the guidelines established under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  we review the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell 
acquisition of real estate property and related assets in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact on the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions  as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  net cash provided by operating activities  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions although we historically have not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real estate investments  we may rely on the temporary use of borrowings needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources issuance of additional equity  including common and preferred shares  issuance of additional debt securities  undistributed cash provided by operating activities  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
we do not believe the state of the credit markets will adversely affect our ability to secure long term financing 
rental operations we believe our principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions  as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
however  we believe that these risks may be mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our markets and the fact that we perform in house credit reviews and analyses on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
debt and equity securities we had an unsecured line of credit available at december  during  the borrowing capacity on this line of credit was increased from billion to billion 
additionally  in july  one of our consolidated majority owned subsidiaries entered into a lending agreement that included an additional unsecured line of credit 
our unsecured lines of credit as of december  are described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date outstanding balance at december  unsecured line of credit january unsecured line of credit consolidated subsidiary july we use our line of credit to fund development activities  acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital 
this line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
the interest rate on the amounts outstanding on the unsecured line of credit as of december  was libor plus  which for borrowings outstanding at december  ranged from to 
our line of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to variable interest indebtedness  consolidated net worth and debt to market capitalization 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our line of credit 
the consolidated subsidiary s unsecured line of credit allows for borrowings up to million at a rate of libor plus 
equal to for outstanding borrowings as of december  
the unsecured line of credit is used to fund development activities within the consolidated subsidiary 
the consolidated subsidiary s unsecured line of credit matures in july with a month extension option 
at december   we had on file with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of debt securities including guarantees thereof  common shares  preferred shares  depository shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts and units comprised of one or more of the securities described therein 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
