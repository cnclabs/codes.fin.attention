the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a pharmaceutical company  incorporated in delaware in  dedicated to the development and commercialization of therapeutic products for large underserved markets 
the investigational products currently under development could serve the obesity  diabetes and sexual health markets 
our current and future products in development will encompass patented proprietary formulations and novel delivery systems and future products may be developed by seeking new indications for previously approved pharmaceutical products 
to date  through employment of this strategy we have one commercial product and several development stage products that address these markets 
in these sectors patients seek more effective treatment options with fewer negative side effects 
with respect to obesity  analysts estimate that this potential market could exceed billion annually 
sales of approved drugs for diabetes exceed billion 
the indications targeted by vivus investigational sexual health products each represent a projected market greater than billion annually 
the current product pipeline includes three late stage clinical products  each addressing specific components of the obesity  diabetes and sexual health markets 
one of these investigational products  qnexa  is in phase clinical trials for obesity and phase clinical trials for diabetes 
all of the pivotal phase studies for qnexa were initiated in the fourth quarter of the co primary endpoints for these studies will evaluate the differences between treatments from baseline to the end of the treatment period  in mean percent weight loss and in the percentage of subjects achieving weight loss of or more 
all phase studies will utilize our novel once a day formulation of qnexa  which at full strength  contains mg phentermine immediate release and mg topiramate controlled release 
pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic pk pd studies indicated that the once a day formulation is comparable to the twice a day formulation used in the phase study 
our late stage investigational product pipeline includes qnexa for treating obesity  for which the phase studies have been initiated  qnexa for treating type diabetes  which is in phase clinical trials  luramist testosterone mdts is being developed to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women  for which a phase study has been completed  and avanafil is being developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction  for which phase studies have been completed 
our former investigational product  evamist  a metered dose transdermal estradiol spray approved for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause  was sold to k v pharmaceutical company k v on may  we had completed phase studies for evamist in may and a new drug application nda was approved by the united states food and drug administration the fda on july  on march   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with k v to transfer certain of our assets and grant a sublicense under our exclusive rights to certain patents and know how related to evamist pursuant to our estradiol development and commercialization agreement with fempharm pty ltd 
and acrux dds pty ltd 
together  acrux  dated february   as amended the acrux agreement to k v the transaction 
on may   the transaction with k v closed 
under the terms of the transaction  we received an upfront payment of million upon the closing 
on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions  and all files related thereto to k v and on august   we received a million milestone payment from k v 
k v also paid million of the million product approval milestone payment due to acrux upon approval of evamist 
we are also eligible to receive certain one time milestone payments from k v totaling to million based on the achievement of certain annual net sales thresholds for evamist 
in  we launched muse alprostadil in the united states and  together with our partners  internationally 
we market muse as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
our future our goal is to build a successful pharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience to advance the development of investigational product candidates in our pipeline  establishing strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  licensing complementary clinical stage investigational product candidates or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets  and partnering our late stage investigational product candidates with third parties 
it is our objective to become a leader in the development and commercialization of products for large underserved markets 
we believe that we have strong intellectual property supporting several opportunities in obesity and diabetes treatment and sexual health 
our future growth will depend on our ability to further develop and obtain regulatory approval of our investigational product candidates as well as in licensing and product line extensions 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and through product sales of muse 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as investigational product candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
in connection with the sale of evamist  we received million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
as discussed in note sale of evamist product  an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon the fda s approval of the evamist nda 
these payments are non refundable and have been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may   which is the remaining term of a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
as compared to revenues from product sales  license and other revenue will be significant on a quarterly basis until all of the revenue from the sale of evamist is recognized  currently expected to be may since the million has been received and we have no related contingencies  the future recognition of revenue and the corresponding reduction of deferred revenue related to the evamist sale will have no impact on our cash flows from operations in future periods through may as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in future years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  rebates and sales reserves  research and development expenses  doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventories  contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product revenue product sales are recognized as revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales allowances and reserves revenues from product sales are recorded net of product sales allowances for expected returns of expired product  government chargebacks  other rebates  and cash discounts for prompt payment 
these sales allowances are deducted from gross product revenues at the time such revenues are recognized along with the recording of a corresponding reserve  or liability 
in making these estimates we take into consideration our historical information  current contractual and statutory requirements  shelf life of our products  estimated customer inventory levels and information received from outside parties 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating the reserve balances in any accounting period 
our product sales allowances and reserves include product returns we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states in accordance with our product returns policy 
our returns policy allows product returns within the period beginning six months prior to and twelve months following product expiration 
as of december   the shipments of muse in the united states made in  and a portion of the shipments in remain subject to future returns 
we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience 
there is no right of return on expired product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus  no returns reserve is needed 
we estimate our returns reserve by utilizing historical information and data obtained from external sources  along with the shelf life of the product 
we track the actual returns on a lot by lot basis along with date of production and date of expiration 
we review the actual returns experience for trends 
we calculate our returns reserve by applying an estimated return rate to the quantity of units sold that is subject to future return 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust the reserves accordingly 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known 
government chargebacks government chargebacks are contractual commitments by us to provide muse to federal government organizations including the veterans administration at specified prices 
government chargeback allowances are recorded at the time of sale and accrued as a reserve 
in estimating the government chargeback reserve  we analyze actual chargeback amounts and apply chargeback rates to estimates of the quantity of units subject to chargeback 
we routinely reassess the chargeback estimates and adjust the reserves accordingly 
other rebates we estimate amounts payable by us for medicare part d rebates  and other rebate programs  primarily with managed care organizations  for the reimbursement of portions of the prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
rebate allowances are estimated and reserved at the time of sale 
we estimate this reserve by utilizing historical information  contractual and statutory requirements  estimated quantities sold to these organizations and estimated customer inventory levels 
effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicaid reimbursement and effective january   muse no longer qualifies for medicare part d 
cash discounts we offer cash discounts to wholesaler distributors  generally of the sales price as an incentive for prompt payment 
the estimate of cash discounts is recorded at the time of sale 
we account for the cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts we expect wholesaler distributors to take 
all of the aforementioned categories of sales allowances are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our sales allowance adjustments to fluctuate 
if actual returns  government chargebacks  rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required which could have an adverse effect on financial results in the period of adjustment 
revisions to estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
license and other revenue we recognize license revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements  or such elements are insignificant 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the development or agreement period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
on may   we closed our transaction with k v pharmaceutical company k v for the sale of our product candidate  evamist  a metered dose transdermal spray for the treatment of menopause symptoms 
at the time of the sale  evamist was an investigational product and was not yet approved by the fda for marketing 
the sale transaction contained multiple deliverables  including the delivery at closing of the evamist assets mainly raw material inventory and certain fixed assets  a grant of a sublicense of our rights under a license related to evamist  and a license to the mdts applicator  the delivery upon receipt of regulatory approval of evamist  along with all regulatory submissions  and  lastly  the delivery after fda approval of certain transition services and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
we received approval from the fda to market evamist on july  fda approval  and on august   we transferred and assigned the evamist fda submissions  and all files related thereto to k v 
we received an upfront payment of million in may upon the closing and received an additional million milestone payment in august upon fda approval 
these payments are non refundable 
we evaluated this multiple deliverable arrangement under eitf to determine whether the deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting 
upon fda approval  the two remaining deliverables are the transition services to be performed under the transition services agreement tsa and a license to improvements to the mdts applicator improvement license during the two year period commencing with the closing  or may   and ending on may  we are able to establish fair value for the tsa 
as it relates to the improvement license  no specific value was assigned in the agreement 
we have no obligation to develop improvements to the mdts applicator and have no plans to expend significant resources in this endeavor 
however  as required under eitf  we do not have objective  reliable evidence of fair value or evidence of inconsequential value to the customer of the improvement license 
accordingly  the delivered items  together with the undelivered items  are bundled together and are treated as one unit of accounting 
as a result  the initial million paid at closing and the million paid upon fda approval have been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as license revenue  together with the future billings under the tsa  if any  ratably over the remaining month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  the revenue related to the transaction recognized in the year ended december  is million and such revenue in future quarters is expected to be recognized as follows in thousands quarter ending license revenue march   june   september   december   march   june   we may also receive milestone payments of up to million based upon sales of evamist through the term of the agreements 
revenues associated with these performance milestones will be recognized when they are earned and collectiblity is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses include license fees  related compensation  consultants fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses related to r d activities and clinical trial costs at other companies and research institutions under agreements which are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
we also record accruals for estimated ongoing clinical trial costs 
clinical trial costs represent costs incurred by clinical research organizations  cros  and clinical sites 
these costs are recorded as a component of r d expenses 
under our agreements  progress payments are typically made to investigators  clinical sites and cros 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs when evaluating the adequacy of accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers for product sales resulting in accounts receivable 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
customer accounts are monitored for past due amounts 
past due accounts receivable  determined to be uncollectible  are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based upon past due amounts  historical losses and existing economic factors  and are adjusted periodically 
the accounts receivable are reported on the balance sheet  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  as of december   it was not considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
the provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year ended december   relates to the us alternative minimum tax amt  tax expense as a result of excess tax benefits related to share based compensation plans the benefit of which is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as additional paid in capital and state income taxes 
the utilization of tax loss carryforwards is limited in the calculation of amt and as a result  a federal tax charge was recorded in the year ended december  the current amt liability is available as a credit against future tax obligations upon the full utilization or expiration of the company s net operating loss carryforward 
the provision reflects tax recognition of the entire million in non refundable payments we received from k v in the year ended december  for the sale of evamist see note sale of evamist product to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as of december   we believed that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet would not ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would recognize a benefit to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions  including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognizing  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the adoption date 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognized a decrease of approximately million in our income tax liability  which resulted in a decrease of million in accumulated deficit 
see note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of the impact of adopting fin no 
on january  inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence  unmarketable or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in  we recorded a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil  considered to be in excess of projected production needs 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against our inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
in  we disposed of million of fully reserved alprostadil which had no impact on cost of goods sold 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million relating to raw materials and components 
in the first quarter of  we determined that we likely would continue to use some portion of the fully reserved component parts inventory in production 
when we record inventory reserves  we establish a new  lower cost basis for the inventory for accounting purposes 
accordingly  to the extent that this fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and  it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
available for sale securities we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
through february   we restricted our investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate and asset backed securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio was not to exceed months 
on february   the audit committee of the board of directors approved a change to the investment policy to be more restrictive in the focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
future cash investments are restricted to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate debt obligations rated aa aa or a p or better or asset backed commercial paper rated a p or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio for new investments is not to exceed months 
we invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily corporate debt securities and asset backed securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired we would experience losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
certain of these securities are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by us sub prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair value  as provided by our investment advisor  columbia management llc columbia  an affiliate of bank of america 
we may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than months until maturity 
in response to changes in the availability of and the yield on alternative investments as well as liquidity requirements  we will occasionally sell these securities prior to their stated maturities 
as these securities are viewed by us as available to support current operations  based on the provisions of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter a  working capital current assets and liabilities  securities with maturities beyond months are classified as current assets under the caption available for sale securities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our marketable securities are maintained at one financial institution and are governed by our investment policy as approved by our board of directors 
our policy is to record investments in marketable securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
any gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
the change in unrealized gains losses on investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for  and  in thousands  are  and  respectively 
we recognize all realized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in income before provision for income taxes 
from and until december we had an investment in columbia strategic cash portfolio strategic cash offered by our investment advisor  columbia 
strategic cash is an enhanced money market fund in which the fund sought to maintain a per share net asset value 
we used strategic cash for the investment of excess cash  and periodic transfers were made from strategic cash to the operating cash account to fund our current operations 
in early december  we were notified by columbia that the strategic cash fund was closed and that the fund was to be liquidated 
the fund no longer supported the per share net asset value and switched to a market value fund in which all investments were marked to market 
we were given the option of staying in the fund and receiving cash proceeds from the fund as its holdings were liquidated or receiving a pro rata share of the investments held by the fund 
upon advice from our investment advisor  we took redemption in kind consisting of cash  interest receivable and a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  consisting principally of high quality corporate debt and asset backed securities 
prior to the redemption our investment in strategic cash was million 
on december  and december   we received our redemption in kind consisting of securities with a market value of million  interest receivable of  and cash of million 
the difference between our investment in strategic cash of million and the fair value of the securities  cash and interest receivable totaling million received in kind resulted in a loss of million 
this loss of million is reflected in interest income in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income loss 
the securities distributed to us from strategic cash included corporate bonds  commercial paper  asset backed securities and other securities 
certain of the securities transferred to us from strategic cash  totaling million in fair value at transfer  did not comply with our investment policy due to either credit ratings  length of maturities or sectors not allowed under the policy 
these securities were approved by the audit committee of the board of directors for acceptance into our portfolio 
the securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in value depending on market conditions 
we monitor our investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
in order to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  our financial condition and business outlook  including key operational and cash flow metrics  current market conditions and future trends in our industry  our relative competitive position within the industry  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
share based payments we follow the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment sfas r 
we adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under sfas r  the estimated fair value of share based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units granted under our stock option plan and purchases of common stock by employees at a discount to market price under the employee stock purchase plan the espp  is recognized as compensation expense 
compensation expense for purchases under the espp is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock purchase rights during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount 
we recorded million of share based compensation expense for the year ended december   and million of share based compensation expense for the year ended december  share based compensation expense is allocated among cost of goods sold and manufacturing  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function of the related employee 
this charge had no impact on our cash flows for the periods presented 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the share based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of judgment are the estimated lives of the share based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
we calculated the estimated life of stock options granted using a simplified method  which is based on the average of the vesting term and the term of the option  as a result of guidance from the sec  as contained in staff accounting bulletin no 
permitting the initial use of this method 
we determine expected volatility using the historical method  which is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over the expected term of the option 
management selected the historical method primarily because we have not identified a more reliable or appropriate method to predict future volatility

results of operations executive overview for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share  during the same period in the decreased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the amortization of the deferred license revenue earned due to the sale of evamist to k v in may the increase in revenue was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  primarily for research and development  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in connection with the sale of evamist  we received million 
the sale of evamist was a unique transaction 
as discussed in note business and significant accounting policies sale of evamist product and note sale of evamist product  an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon fda approval of evamist 
these payments are non refundable and have been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as license and other revenue ratably over a month period  from august  to may   which is the remaining term of a license to improvements to the mdts applicator 
as compared to revenues from product sales  license and other revenue will be significant on a quarterly basis until all of the revenue from the sale of evamist is recognized  currently expected to be may since the million has been received and we have no related contingencies  the future recognition of revenue and the corresponding reduction of deferred revenue related to the evamist sale will have no impact on our cash flows from operations in future periods through may the revenue related to the transaction recognized in the year ended december  is million and the revenue in future quarters is expected to be recognized as follows in thousands quarter ending license revenue march   june   september   december   march   june   for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share  during the same period in the decreased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to higher domestic product revenue and decreased clinical activities related to vivus clinical development programs for sexual health  partially offset by increased spending related to the qnexa program 
with the exception of income generated from the revenue recognition of the million received from k v  we may have continued losses in future years  depending on the timing of our research and development expenditures  because we expect muse sales to remain steady and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and development investigational product candidates to bring those potential products to market 
revenue change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages united states product  net    international product    license and other revenue   total revenues    worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  an increase of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the increase in domestic revenues in is mainly due to increases in both domestic prices and shipment volume 
domestic demand for muse at the retail and government level remains consistent with the prior period  averaging approximately  units per quarter 
similar to prior years  wholesalers made purchases in the fourth quarter of that were greater than the current demand 
based on the fourth quarter demand for muse  we estimate purchases made by wholesalers in the fourth quarter of represent approximately to months of excess demand 
the increase in international revenues in is mainly due to the timing of orders from our international distributors as well as adjustments to our sales allowance 
the increase in license and other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of the deferred license revenue earned due to the sale of evamist 
worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  an increase of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the increase in revenues in was mainly due to increases in both domestic prices and shipment volume  partially offset by the timing of orders from our international distributors 
the increase in other revenue is primarily due to the amortization of a million milestone payment from our european distributor  meda ab that we received in the first quarter of although the demand for muse has stabilized  given the loss of coverage under medicare part d  we are not able to anticipate if wholesalers will continue their historical pattern of making purchases in the fourth quarter that exceed expected quarterly demands 
if wholesalers do not repeat this pattern of purchasing quantities of muse that exceed quarterly demands  revenues from the sale of muse in may be lower as compared to on march   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with k v  to transfer our assets and grant a sublicense of our rights under the acrux agreement related to evamist to k v the transaction 
the closing of the transaction occurred on may  and on july   we received fda approval of the evamist nda 
an initial million was paid at closing and million was paid upon fda approval 
these payments have been recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining month term of the improvement license  from august  to may  cost of goods sold and manufacturing change increase years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold and manufacturing    cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold in the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense is the result of increased stock based compensation expense of  partially offset by other cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense net decreases of  in the year ended december  as a result of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility  we expensed approximately million in manufacturing overhead costs as period costs in the year ended december   as compared to million the prior year 
this accounting treatment is based on the determination made during the restructuring that the manufacturing capacity of the new jersey plant far exceeds the level of production required to meet estimated future market demand 
cost of goods sold in the year ended december  increased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense is the result of a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil in excess of projected production needs   of additional stock based compensation expense  partially offset by other cost of goods sold and manufacturing expense net decreases of  in the year ended december  as a result of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility  we expensed approximately million in manufacturing overhead costs as period costs in the year ended december   as compared to million the prior year 
we anticipate that cost of goods sold in will be similar to costs incurred in research and development change increase decrease years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages research and development    research and development expenses in the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a million net increase in project related spending including increased spending of million for qnexa partially offset by decreased spending of million for evamist and million for alista and a net increase of million in non project related spending primarily due to increases of  in stock based compensation expense and  in increased compensation and related expense due to an increase in headcount in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  evamist and alista clinical trial activities ended in and consequently  aside from the million milestone payment made to acrux in august for the approval of evamist  there was little spending on these projects in research and development expenses in the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  decreased clinical trial and project activity for evamist  avanafil  and alista resulted in decreased spending for these projects of million in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increased qnexa project expenses of million   of stock based compensation expense and an incremental increase in other research and development related spending in as compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase significantly in  as we continue to advance the clinical program for qnexa for the treatment of obesity and our other programs 
the current remaining contractual obligation with our primary contract research organization for the phase qnexa trials totals million which will be recorded as research and development expense in the next two years 
there are likely to be additional research and development expenses related to qnexa and our other programs under development 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical and preclinical studies 
if we are successful in obtaining fda regulatory approval for any new investigational product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts  we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of such new products  if any  for several years 
we filed an nda for evamist with the fda in the third quarter of and in october made a million clinical development milestone payment to acrux under the terms of our licensing agreement related to this filing  which was expensed in the third quarter of on july   the fda approved the nda for evamist 
k v paid million of the million product approval milestone payment made to acrux in august for the approval of the nda for evamist 
selling  general and administrative change increase years ended december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative    selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  of million increased million  or as compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   the increase is primarily due to incremental increases in non cash stock based compensation expense of million  muse related sales and marketing expenses of  accrued compensation of  accounting  tax and audit fees of  due in part to the sale of evamist and other tax consultation  investor relations expenses of  board of director fees of  and corporate legal fees of  as compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  of million increased million  or as compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   the increase is primarily due to million in non cash stock based compensation expense  and incremental net increases in muse related sales and marketing expenses of million and legal fees of  as compared to the year ended december  we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses in will be similar to interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in our average investment cash balance due to the receipt of million from k v for the sale of evamist in for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  partially offset by the million realized loss on investments due to the redemption in kind of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio see note cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period in on april   in connection with the sale of evamist to k v  we paid off the million outstanding balance on the tanabe line of credit  including all accrued interest and terminated the line of credit 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances due to increased financing in and related investment yields from the year ended december  to december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period in the increased interest expense is primarily due to the crown bank loan  which was obtained on january   and a higher loan balance outstanding for the tanabe loan 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  as compared to  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes in the amount of million for the year ended december  relates to the us amt  tax expense as a result of the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation plans the benefit of which is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as additional paid in capital and state income taxes  while the provision for the year ended december  relates to state income taxes 
the utilization of tax loss carryforwards is limited in the calculation of amt and as a result  a federal tax charge was recorded in the year ended december  this provision reflects tax recognition of the entire million in non refundable payments we received from k v in the year ended december  for the sale of evamist 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  relates to state income taxes  while the provision for the year ended december  relates to both state and foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million is the net result of cash provided by operating activities offset by cash used for investing and financing activities for the year ended december  included in these amounts are the million received from the k v transaction and million from exercises of stock options  partially offset by the million payoff of the tanabe loan 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities 
through december   we raised million from financing activities  received million from the sale of evamist and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  available for sale securities 
we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
through february   we restricted our investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate and asset backed securities  including commercial paper  rated a p f or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio was not to exceed months 
on february  the audit committee of the board of directors approved a change to the investment policy to be more restrictive in the focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
future investments are restricted to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate debt obligations rated aa aa or a p or better or asset backed commercial paper rated a p or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio for new investments is not to exceed months 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in available for sale securities 
we invest our excess cash balances in money market and marketable securities  primarily high quality corporate debt securities and asset backed securities  in accordance with our investment policy 
the investment policy has the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk  however  there may be times when certain of the securities in our portfolio will fall below the credit ratings required in the policy 
if those securities are downgraded or impaired we would experience losses in the value of our portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
certain of these securities are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by us sub prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
we currently believe we will be able to realize the par value of our investments without significant loss  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities or an improvement in the liquidity of the financial markets to realize the par value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on certain of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan  however  these market risks associated with our investment portfolio could cause the loss of a significant portion of our investments which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million  as compared to million at december  currently  we do not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
as of february   we had collected of the december  accounts receivable 
liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december   million higher than at december  the change in total liabilities includes a million net increase in deferred revenue  primarily due to million in deferred license revenue received from k v on the sale of evamist  a million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments for goods and services supporting the development effort for qnexa  and a reduction in notes payable  primarily due to the million payoff of the tanabe loan in the second quarter of as mentioned above  the deferred revenue balance primarily results from the k v transaction and the related amortization over time of the revenue 
deferred revenue is a non cash liability and does not represent any future obligations on our part 
we have entered into manufacturing agreements with suppliers to purchase raw materials 
as of december   our remaining commitment under these agreements is to purchase a minimum of million of product from through in  we recorded a  inventory write down related to the purchase of alprostadil considered to be in excess of projected production needs 
should our inventory of raw materials exceed our future production needs  it may be necessary to write off additional excess inventory 
in february  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with acrux limited and a subsidiary of acrux under which we have agreed to develop and commercialize luramist and evamist in the united states for various female health applications

operating activities 
our operating activities provided million and used and million of cash during the years ended december   and  respectively

during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was partially offset by a million reduction in our accounts receivable  due to the collection of monies owed to us  and the recording of million in non cash stock based compensation expense  due to the adoption of fas r in these operating cash flow sources were offset by a million reduction in accrued research  clinical and licensing fees  primarily due to the payment of accrued licensing fees to tanabe of million in during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was partially offset by a million reduction in our accounts receivable  due to the collection of monies owed to us  and non cash depreciation expense of million 
investing activities 
our investing activities used and million and provided million in cash during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the investment of the million received from the k v transaction and the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities 
in addition  in  we provided crown bank with a  certificate of deposit as security for the loan agreement we entered into with them on january  and in  we purchased from our landlord our principal manufacturing facility for million offset by the release of restricted cash of million 
financing activities 
financing activities used cash of million and provided cash of and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  the cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the million payoff of the tanabe loan in the second quarter of  partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million in excess tax benefits related to share based compensation plans  which is correspondingly shown as a use of cash for operating activities 
in  the cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the million net proceeds from the registered direct sales of  shares of common stock on may  at a price of per share   shares of common stock on november  at a price of per share  and  shares of common stock on december  at a price of per share  in addition to the million net proceeds from the crown bank loan we entered into on january  in  these amounts include the proceeds from the march  sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  providing us with net proceeds of million

the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
this shelf registration statement file number replaces shelf registration statement file number 
on november   we raised million in a registered direct offering of our common stock pursuant to this shelf registration statement 
under the terms of this financing  we sold and issued a total of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in an initial closing and an additional  shares in a second closing on december  all of the shares of common stock were offered pursuant to an effective registration statement on form s filed with the sec on july  the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of an investigational product candidate 
it is also important to note that if a clinical candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
the nature and efforts required to develop our investigational product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  preclinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each investigational product candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of matters arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that an investigational product candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our investigational product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish substantial evidence of safety and efficacy 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently fail to establish safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations  sublicenses and strategic alliances  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  the results of operations  demand for muse  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs at least through however  we anticipate that we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our investigational product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to acrux and tanabe  in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
similar to the transaction with evamist we may consider divesting any of our products in development or our commercial product in order to raise additional funding 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or investigational product candidates 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses may result in future losses from operations 
we are continually evaluating our existing portfolio and we may choose to divest or spin off one or more of our products or investigational product candidates at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include milestones or future interest expense and assume non termination of agreements 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts  which are subject to change payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases manufacturing and other agreements    clinical trials    notes payable   total contractual obligations    operating leases we purchased our previously leased manufacturing facilities in lakewood  new jersey on december  in november  we entered into a new month lease for our existing mountain view corporate headquarters location with our existing landlord 
the new lease commenced on february  the lease expires on july  and allows us one option to extend the term of the lease for a period of one year from the expiration of the lease

we make payments to these providers based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
these obligations  however  are contingent on future events  eg the rate of patient accrual in our clinical trials 
this amount represents the remaining contractual amounts due under various contracts  although all of these contracts could be cancelled by us  in which case we would only be liable to the vendors for work performed to the date of cancellation 
notes payable on january   we obtained a million loan from crown 
the land and buildings  among other assets  located at our principal manufacturing facility and a  certificate of deposit held by crown serve as collateral for these agreements 
the loan is payable over a year term

principal and interest are payable monthly based upon a year amortization schedule and are adjusted annually at the time of the interest rate reset 
all remaining principal is due on february  the interest rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we have a principal balance of million remaining on the crown loan 
additional payments we have entered into development  license and supply agreements which contain provisions for payments upon completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
due to the uncertainty concerning when and if these milestones may be completed  we have not included these potential future obligations in the above table 
tanabe in january  we entered into an exclusive development  license and supply agreement with tanabe for the development and commercialization of avanafil  a pde inhibitor compound for the oral and local treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction 
under the terms of the agreement  tanabe agreed to grant an exclusive license to us for products containing avanafil outside of japan  north korea  south korea  china  taiwan  singapore  indonesia  malaysia  thailand  vietnam and the philippines 
we agreed to grant tanabe an exclusive  royalty free license within those countries for oral products that we develop containing avanafil 
in addition  we agreed to grant tanabe an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive  royalty bearing license within those countries for non oral products that we develop containing avanafil 
further  we granted tanabe the option to obtain co promotional rights for oral products that we develop under our license for up to of the promotional activity in our territory 
tanabe agreed to manufacture and supply us with avanafil for use in clinical trials  which will be our primary responsibility 
we have paid upfront licensing fees of million to tanabe and have agreed to make additional payments upon the completion of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical trial with avanafil  which meets one of the clinical development milestone criteria above 
we paid tanabe million in connection with this milestone in we have further agreed to pay royalties on net sales of products containing avanafil 
no payments were made under this agreement with tanabe in the year ended december  acrux in february  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with acrux limited acrux and its subsidiary under which we have agreed to develop and  if approved  commercialize luramist and evamist in the united states for various female health applications 
acrux s metered dose transdermal spray  or mdts  technology is a patented  simple to use spray that is being developed to deliver testosterone and estradiol effectively to women when applied to the skin 
we agreed to grant acrux s subsidiary a non exclusive  royalty free license outside the united states for any mdts products containing improvements we have made to the licensed intellectual property and the option to obtain a non exclusive  worldwide license for our intellectual property related to mdts products

we have paid million in clinical development milestones payments to date  including the million milestone payment we made to acrux in october related to the submission of an nda to the fda for evamist and the million product approval milestone payment for approval of this nda  which was paid in august per the terms of our asset purchase agreement with k v for the sale of our evamist product  we granted a sublicense of our rights under the acrux agreement related to evamist to k v and k v paid million of this million obligation 
although we have sublicensed our rights under the acrux agreement related to evamist to k v  we will continue to have certain obligations under this license in the event that k v does not satisfy the requirements under the sublicense agreement 
see note sale of evamist product to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning the terms of this agreement and note legal matters for further information regarding acrux 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities 
we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and to certain of our clinical research organizations and investigators sites 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
pursuant to the terms of the k v transaction for the sale of evamist  we made certain representations and warranties concerning our rights and assets related to evamist and our authority to enter into and consummate the transaction 
we also made certain covenants which survive the closing date of the transaction  including a covenant not to operate a business that competes  in the united states  and its territories and protectorates  with the evamist product 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify potential material losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the area of changes in united states interest rates 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of investment grade securities 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
based on information provided by our investment advisor  columbia management llc  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately  to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities 
we hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we have investments in commercial paper  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  and other securities 
while the company now earns a premium interest rate on these investments  some of these investments are not liquid 
the company presently does not need to access these funds for operating purposes 
we have the ability to generally hold our investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
in the event the company needs to access these funds  it may not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on the million loan payable to crown bank  na as of december  the loan is payable over a year term 
the interest rate is adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus  with a floor of 
the interest rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively
