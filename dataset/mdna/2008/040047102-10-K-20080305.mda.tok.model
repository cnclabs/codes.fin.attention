overview we have incurred net losses of million from our inception in april through december   and expect to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the next several years or more as we continue our research and development activities  including our clinical program for our lead drug candidate  lorcaserin hydrochloride  or lorcaserin  for the treatment of obesity  and our clinical programs for apd for the treatment of insomnia and apd for the treatment of arterial thromboembolic diseases 
we expect that the external expenses for our ongoing phase lorcaserin program  the majority of which we expect will be expensed through the first half of  will be substantial 
to date  we have generated cash and funded our operations primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  payments from collaborators and sale leaseback transactions 
from our inception through december   we have generated billion in cash from these sources  of which million was through sales of stock  million was through payments from our current and past collaborators and million was from sale leaseback transactions 
recent and highlights include in january  announced the initiation of a phase clinical trial of a second generation oral niacin receptor agonist intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis under our partnership with merck co  inc  or merck 
in january  entered into strategic cooperation agreements with siegfried ltd that are primarily related to the manufacturing of lorcaserin  which is expected to be necessary for our planned new drug application submission to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and for commercialization of lorcaserin after regulatory marketing approval 
the agreements include a long term supply agreement for our purchase of lorcaserin active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  the purchase of certain drug product facility assets  including fixtures  equipment  other personal property and real estate assets  a contract manufacturing agreement whereby we will manufacture certain products for siegfried  and a services agreement 
in january  reported positive phase a clinical trial results of apd  our oral  internally discovered drug candidate intended for the treatment and prevention of arterial thromboembolic diseases  and initiated a phase b clinical trial to further evaluate this drug candidate 
in january  announced that initial clinical trial results for apd  an oral drug candidate discovered by arena and investigated for the treatment of type diabetes under our partnership with ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  a johnson johnson company  or ortho mcneil  suggest that the glucose dependent insulinotropic receptor  or gdir  may improve glucose control in patients with type diabetes 
based on the data from those studies  ortho mcneil put apd on hold and has advanced a potentially more potent arena discovered gdir agonist into preclinical development 
in december  initiated blossom and bloom dm  the second and third phase clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of lorcaserin for the treatment of obesity 
these one year  double blind  randomized and placebo controlled trials are expected to collectively enroll approximately  overweight and obese patients 
consistent with our proposal  the fda has allowed us to eliminate the requirement to perform echocardiographic testing prior to enrolling patients in both of these trials 
in november  completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in september  announced positive preliminary results from our phase a clinical trial of apd in patients with chronic insomnia 
in this phase a clinical trial  apd significantly improved endpoints measuring improvements in sleep maintenance with no observations of next day cognitive impairment 
in september  reported that an independent echocardiographic data safety monitoring board  or esmb  found no reason to stop our ongoing pivotal phase lorcaserin bloom trial following a planned review of unblinded echocardiograms performed after patients completed six months of dosing in the trial 
the review confirmed that differences  if any  in the rates of fda defined valvulopathy in patients treated with lorcaserin and in the control group did not meet predetermined stopping criteria 
the review also confirmed that the rate of fda defined valvulopathy is consistent with our statistical powering assumptions used in the design of the phase clinical trial program to monitor patients for any increased risk of developing valvulopathy 
in may  completed the sale to an affiliate of biomed realty trust  inc  or biomed  of three properties owned and occupied by us and the assignment to biomed of an option to purchase a fourth property currently leased and primarily occupied by us 
we received net proceeds of million for the properties and the purchase option 
concurrently with the closing of the transaction  we leased back the three properties sold to biomed under leases with year terms and two consecutive options to extend such terms for five years each 
as part of the transaction  we also retained the option to purchase from biomed all the properties included in the transaction on the th  th or th anniversary of the execution date of the leases 
in february  completed patient enrollment in our bloom trial  a double blind  randomized and placebo controlled trial that enrolled over  patients at approximately sites in the united states 
we will need to raise a substantial amount of cash to continue to develop our drug candidates and sustain our research efforts 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the drug development process is long  uncertain and expensive  and our ability to achieve our goals depends on numerous factors  many of which are out of our control 
we will seek to balance the need to invest heavily in research to find new drugs and in clinical development and manufacturing to advance our drug candidates against the need to sustain our operations long enough for our collaborators or us to commercialize the results of our efforts 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses over the next several years 
we do not expect to generate positive operating cash flows for at least several years and  accordingly  we will need to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other financing  or through partnering one or more of our more advanced programs 
our cash used in operations is expected to increase as we continue our clinical stage programs and our research efforts  continue to incur general and administrative expenses  including prosecuting patents  and have reached the end of the research funding portion of our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck in the fourth quarter of absent any new collaboration  we expect to recognize no revenues from research funding in and thereafter 
summary of revenues and expenses we are providing the following summary of our revenues and expenses to supplement the more detailed discussion below 
the following tables are stated in millions 
revenues years ended december  collaborations ortho mcneil merck total revenues research and development expenses years ended december  type of expense external preclinical and clinical study fees and expenses personnel costs facility and equipment costs research supplies other total research and development expenses general and administrative expenses years ended december  type of expense personnel costs legal  accounting and other professional fees facility and equipment costs other total general and administrative expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
we recorded revenues of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  all of our revenues recorded during the year ended december  resulted from our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck  and included million in amortization of milestone achievements and technology access and development fees received in prior years  million in research funding  and million for patent activities 
all of our revenues during the year ended december  were also from our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck  and included a million milestone earned under our ortho mcneil collaboration and a million milestone earned under our merck collaboration  both of which we recognized immediately in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  million in amortization of milestone achievements and technology access and development fees  million in research funding  and million in additional sponsored research and patent activities 
in october  we extended and expanded the collaboration we entered into with merck in  and merck purchased million of our stock at a price of per share  approximately a premium to the then current market price 
we performed an evaluation on this stock purchase and determined that million of the million purchase price was an upfront payment related to the collaboration extension and expansion 
accordingly  we recognized the million upfront payment  as well as the remaining portion of the unamortized upfront payment at october of million  over the extended research portion of the collaboration term of three years 
additionally  in october  we achieved a million milestone under this collaboration which was also recognized over the extended term of the research portion of the collaboration because it was reasonably assured to be achieved at the time we extended and expanded the collaboration 
in february  we amended the collaboration to reduce the number of arena research employees funded under the collaboration in exchange for merck purchasing million of our common stock 
this equity investment  equal to the reduction in their research funding obligation  was at a price of per share  approximately a premium to the then current market price 
we performed an evaluation on this stock purchase and determined that million of the million purchase price was an upfront payment related to the collaboration amendment 
accordingly  we recognized this upfront payment and the unamortized portion of the previously received upfront payments over the remaining term of the research portion of the collaboration 
the research portion of this collaboration ended in october in december  we entered into our collaboration and license agreement with ortho mcneil 
this collaboration included a million upfront payment  as well as research funding of million per year  initially until december and subsequently extended until december we amortized this million upfront payment over three years 
in december  we achieved two milestones of million each under this collaboration  which we also recognized over three years because they were reasonably assured to be achieved at the time we entered into the collaboration 
the research portion of this collaboration ended in december our collaborators often pay us before we recognize such payments as current revenues and  accordingly  these payments are recorded as deferred revenues until earned 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenues  all of which is attributable to our license agreement with taigen biotechnology co  ltd 
and is expected to be recognized as revenue in absent any new collaboration  we do not expect to record any revenues from research funding in future revenues for research or clinical milestones that have not yet been achieved are difficult to predict  and our revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we expect that any significant revenues over the next several years will depend on the clinical success of our partnered programs as well as whether we partner lorcaserin  apd  apd or any of our other current or future drug candidates 
ultimately  we expect our future revenues in the long term to primarily depend upon the regulatory approval and commercialization of our partnered or internally developed drugs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which account for the majority of our expenses  consisted primarily of costs associated with external clinical and preclinical study fees  manufacturing costs and other related expenses  and the development of our earlier stage programs and technologies 
our most significant research and development costs are for clinical trials including payments to contract research organizations  or cros  preclinical study fees  personnel costs  research supplies  and facility and equipment costs 
we expense research and development costs to operations as they are incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses 
in the fourth quarter of  we expensed million of lorcaserin clinical drug supply for which we previously had an alternative future use 
as of december   we had no capitalized research and development costs 
other than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  the difference was due primarily to i a million increase in external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses  including manufacturing costs  as we continued the first of our three phase clinical trials and initiated the second and third clinical trials for lorcaserin  and completed a phase a clinical trial of apd and a phase a clinical trial of apd  and ii an increase in personnel costs of a total of million as we increased the number of our research and development employees from at the end of to at the end of and recorded an increase of million to million in non cash  share based compensation related to the expensing of share based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
included in the million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses for the year ended december  was million related to our lorcaserin program  million related to our apd program and million related to our apd program 
included in the million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses for the year ended december  was million related to our lorcaserin program  million related to our apd program and million related to our apd program 
nearly all of the increase in research and development personnel related to the development of our internal programs  primarily lorcaserin  apd and apd assuming favorable results from our month esmb review of bloom  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue our ongoing and planned clinical development 
cumulatively through december   we have recorded million  million and million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and other related expenses for lorcaserin  apd and apd  respectively 
while expenditures on current and future clinical development programs are expected to be substantial and to increase  they are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our drug candidates with a partner or independently 
as a result of such uncertainties  we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether  when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
the duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety of factors  including the number of trials and studies in a clinical program  the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  the rates of patient recruitment and enrollment  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the costs of manufacturing our drug candidates  and the costs  requirements  timing of  and the ability to secure regulatory approvals 
however  based upon our current plans  we expect to incur million to million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and other related expenses in  which includes million  million and million for lorcaserin  apd and apd  respectively 
this assumes that we continue all three of the ongoing phase clinical trials of lorcaserin  as well as the clinical development of apd and apd in we do not expect to receive regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates until late at the earliest  if at all 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to i personnel costs increasing by a total of million as we increased our general and administrative employees from at the end of to at the end of and recorded an increase of million to million in non cash  share based compensation under sfas no 
r  and ii an increase of million in patent costs primarily related to our partnered programs 
to the extent our partners reimburse us for patent costs  the reimbursements are classified as revenues 
such reimbursements totaled million in and million in we expect partner reimbursements for patent costs will be significantly lower in than in we also expect that our general and administrative expenses will be higher in the future due primarily to increases in the number of personnel  as well as commercialization  marketing and business development expenses 
amortization of acquired technology 
we recorded million for amortization of acquired technology for both of the years ended december  and related to our patented melanophore technology  our primary screening technology  which we acquired in for million 
the melanophore technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of years 
we expect to recognize million in each of the next three years for amortization of this technology 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of i million in interest income and ii interest expense and financing costs of million  which included lease payments accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate and sfas no 
accounting for leases on our lease financing obligations 
interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of i million in interest income  ii a million non cash charge related to a warrant issued as part of a settlement with one of our warrant holders  and iii interest expense and financing costs of million 
the increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances throughout was partially offset by increased interest expense recorded in connection with our lease financing 
due to declining interest rates and lower cash balances due to our ongoing and planned clinical development  we expect our interest income to be less than dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a dividend expense of million related to our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the holders of our series b preferred are entitled to dividends that accrue at annually 
this dividend expense  which may be paid in common stock or by increasing the stated value of the series b preferred  increases the net loss allocable to common stockholders 
assuming that the series b preferred is held until the applicable mandatory redemption dates  we expect to record dividends on the series b preferred of million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
we recorded revenues of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  all of our revenues during the year ended december  were from our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck  and included a million milestone earned under our ortho mcneil collaboration and a million milestone earned under our merck collaboration  both of which we recognized immediately in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
also included in our revenues during the year ended december  was million in amortization of milestone achievements and technology access and development fees  million in research funding  and million in additional sponsored research and patent activities 
all of our revenues during the year ended december  were also from our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck  and included a million milestone earned under our merck collaboration and recognized immediately in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  million in amortization of milestone achievements and technology access and development fees  million in research funding  and million in additional sponsored research and patent activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  the difference was due primarily to i external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses  including manufacturing costs  increasing by million as we initiated our larger and more costly phase clinical program for lorcaserin during the third quarter of and continued to advance apd closer to clinical development  and ii personnel costs increasing by a total of million as we increased the number of our research and development employees from at the end of to at the end of and recorded an additional million in non cash  share based compensation related to the expensing of share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
included in the million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses for the year ended december  was million related to our lorcaserin program  million related to our apd program and million related to our apd program 
included in the million in external clinical and preclinical study fees and expenses for the year ended december  was million related to our lorcaserin program and million related to our apd program 
nearly all of the increase in research and development personnel related to the development of our internal programs  primarily lorcaserin  apd and apd general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to i personnel costs increasing by a total of million as we increased our general and administrative employees from at the end of to at the end of and recorded an additional million in non cash  share based compensation under sfas no 
r  and ii an increase of million in patent costs related to our partnered programs and our internal programs and technologies 
to the extent our partners reimburse us for patent costs  the reimbursements are classified as revenues 
such reimbursements totaled million in and million in amortization of acquired technology 
we recorded million for amortization of acquired technology for both of the years ended december  and related to our patented melanophore technology 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of i million in interest income  ii a million non cash charge related to a warrant issued as part of a settlement with one of our warrant holders  and iii interest expense and financing costs of million 
interest and other income  net  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of i million in interest income  ii interest expense and financing costs of million  and iii a million payment received for the termination of our fujisawa collaboration and classified as other income 
the increase in interest income in the year ended december  was the result of both higher cash balances from the two public offerings we completed in and higher average interest rates in compared to dividends on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a dividend expense of million related to our series b preferred for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in april  we issued an additional million in redeemable convertible preferred stock as a result of the preferred stockholders exercise of their unit warrants 
accretion of discount on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded as an expense accretion of discount and deemed dividend on our redeemable convertible preferred stock in the amount of million for the year ended december  in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
we allocated the total proceeds received in our preferred stock financing among the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred  and the related warrants and unit warrants  estimating the value of the warrants and unit warrants at million using the black scholes method 
the fair value of the common stock into which the redeemable convertible preferred stock was convertible into on the date of issuance exceeded the proceeds allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock by million  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature that we recognized as an increase to paid in capital and as a deemed dividend to the redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as a result of the public offering we completed in february  which resulted in the series b preferred becoming immediately redeemable at the option of the holders  we recorded a charge in the first quarter of of million to accrete the remaining unaccreted discount and deemed dividend on the redeemable convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources short term our sources of liquidity include our cash balances and short term investments 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition to our cash and investments  other potential sources of near term liquidity include i equity  debt or other financing  ii the out licensing of our drug candidates  internal drug programs and technologies  iii the sale of facilities that we own  and iv milestone payments from our collaborators 
to date  we have generated cash and funded our operations primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  payments from collaborators and sale leaseback transactions 
from our inception through december   we have generated billion in cash from these sources  of which million was through sales of stock  million was through payments from our current and past collaborators and million was from sale leaseback transactions 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase significantly as we continue our phase program for lorcaserin  initiate a phase b clinical trial of apd  and continue a phase b clinical trial of apd we expect that the external expenses for our phase lorcaserin program  the majority of which we expect will be expensed through the first half of  will be substantial 
a large portion of these external clinical trial expenses are expected to be paid through cros 
our contracts with the primary cros for our phase lorcaserin program can be terminated if  depending on the contract  we give five or days prior written notice  or less in certain circumstances 
in addition to costs related to these clinical trials  we expect to incur significant manufacturing and other pre launch costs for lorcaserin 
we estimate that our phase lorcaserin program will continue in and could take significantly longer than expected to complete for various reasons including those set forth in item a 
risk factors in this annual report 
the research funding we received from our collaborations with ortho mcneil and merck ended in the fourth quarter of and  absent any new collaborations  we expect no revenues from research funding to be recognized in or thereafter from our existing collaborators 
we expect to recognize  in swiss francs  chf million  or million  in revenues from our contract manufacturing agreement with siegfried in  and that such revenues will be offset by related costs and expenses 
we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our objectives over at least the next year  including continuing our development programs for lorcaserin  apd and apd  continuing development of our other lead internal programs  discovering and developing additional drug candidates  integrating our swiss operations  continuing to build our development and manufacturing capabilities  including our manufacturing facilities in switzerland  and maintaining our research discovery capabilities 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the proper level of research  development and manufacturing expenditures  and may adjust such expenditures based upon a variety of factors  such as our month esmb and other clinical trial and preclinical results for our drug candidates  as well as our ability to generate cash through financings and collaborative activities 
we expect our capital expenditures will be higher than in due to the purchase of our swiss manufacturing facilities in january and planned purchases of equipment and improvements to our san diego facilities  including a significant expansion of our property located at nancy ridge drive that is expected to cost approximately million  of which up to million is expected to be reimbursed by the owner of the property in early  less applicable commissions 
the holders of our series b preferred can require us to redeem all or some of their outstanding shares of series b preferred at any time 
we will be required to redeem any shares of series b preferred that remain outstanding on december  at a price equal to the amount of the original holder s original investment  plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of such payment 
the aggregate redemption price of our series b preferred at december  was million  and we expect the aggregate redemption price at the mandatory redemption date of december  to be million 
we may be able to satisfy all or a portion of this amount with shares of our common stock 
our ability and decision whether to use cash or stock to satisfy any redemption will depend on  among other factors  the amount of cash we have  our stock price and the amount of common stock then held by our preferred stockholders 
in may  we sold to biomed three properties that we owned and continue to occupy  and assigned to biomed an option to purchase a fourth property that we currently lease and primarily occupy for total consideration of million  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
concurrently with the closing of the transaction  we leased back the three properties sold to biomed under leases with year terms and two consecutive options to extend such terms for five years each 
initial base rent for these three properties net of taxes  insurance and maintenance costs ie triple net for which we are responsible is an aggregate of million annually  subject to an annual increase of and other specified adjustments 
if  at our election  we complete certain improvements to the properties sold  biomed will pay us up to an additional million less applicable commissions and our lease payments would increase 
the amount of such increase would depend on the year in which such improvements are completed  if ever  with the initial amount of such increase for set at  assuming we receive the full million before applicable commissions  million per year and increasing by approximately each year 
we expect to receive million of such additional amount for improvements in the first quarter of  but that we will not receive the remaining million until  if ever 
such additional amounts  if any  will be reduced by applicable commissions 
we will continue to lease a portion of the property that is subject to biomed s purchase option from the current owner through the expiration of the lease with such owner  at which time we expect that biomed will exercise the purchase option and rent will commence under a lease with biomed for a term that is concurrent with the leases for the other three properties and at an initial base rent for such property triple net of million per year  which would be subject to an annual increase of 
if biomed is unable to exercise the option due to i an amendment to our lease with the current owner of such property that adversely affects such option and such amendment is not consented to by biomed  or ii any casualty loss or proceeding in eminent domain pursuant to which biomed has a right not to exercise the option in accordance with our agreement of purchase and sale  and biomed elects not to exercise the option as a consequence of the occurrence of any event described in i and ii above  we would be required to pay biomed million 
if biomed elects to not exercise the option due to ii above  the lease payments on the remaining three properties would be reduced 
the amount of such reduction would depend on the year in which biomed elects to not exercise the option  if ever  with the initial amount of such reduction for set at million per year and increasing by each year 
in addition  subject to certain restrictions  we will have the option to repurchase all of the properties included in the transaction on the th  th or th anniversary of the execution date of the leases  and earlier if the leases are terminated under certain circumstances 
in january  we entered into strategic cooperation agreements with siegfried ltd that are primarily related to the manufacturing of lorcaserin  which is expected to be necessary for our planned new drug application  or nda  submission to the fda and for commercialization of lorcaserin after regulatory marketing approval 
the agreements include an asset purchase agreement for the purchase from siegfried ltd of certain drug product facility assets and technology  including fixtures  equipment  other personal property and real estate assets in zofingen  switzerland 
we paid chf million  or million  of the cash purchase price in january  and will pay the remaining cash portion of the purchase price of chf million in three equal installments in the third  fourth and fifth years after closing 
this transaction also included a long term supply agreement  a contract manufacturing agreement and a services agreement 
we will continue to be opportunistic in our efforts to generate cash 
we also continue to regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and in licensing opportunities 
any such transaction may impact our liquidity as well as affect our expenses if  for example  our operating expenses increase as a result of such license or acquisition or we use our cash to finance the license or acquisition 
long term we will need to raise or generate significant amounts of cash to achieve our objectives of internally developing drugs  which take many years and potentially several hundreds of millions of dollars to develop  and continuing our research programs 
if we decide to market and commercialize lorcaserin or any other drug candidate independently or with a partner  we may need to invest heavily in associated marketing and commercialization costs 
such costs will be substantial and some will need to be incurred prior to receiving marketing approval from the fda 
we do not currently have adequate internal liquidity to meet these objectives in the long term 
in order to do so  we will need to continue our out licensing activities and look to other external sources of liquidity  including the public and private financial markets and strategic partners 
the length of time that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and any available borrowings will sustain our operations will be based on  among other things  our progress in preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs related to current and planned clinical trials and regulatory decisions  our research  development and manufacturing costs including personnel costs  the progress in our collaborations  costs associated with intellectual property  our capital expenditures  and costs associated with securing any in licensing opportunities 
we do not know whether adequate funding will be available to us or  if available  that such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
any significant shortfall in funding could result in the partial or full curtailment of our development and or research efforts  which  in turn  will affect our development pipeline and ability to generate cash in the future 
in addition to the public and private financial markets  potential sources of liquidity in the long term are milestone and royalty payments from existing and future collaborators and revenues from sales of our drugs 
sources and uses of our cash net cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   and was used primarily to fund our net losses in the period  adjusted for non cash expenses 
non cash expenses included million in share based compensation  million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in amortization of acquired technology  as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   and was used primarily to fund our net losses in the period  adjusted for non cash expenses 
non cash expenses included million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in share based compensation  a million charge related to a warrant settlement  million in amortization of acquired technology  as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million  and was used primarily to fund our net losses in the period  adjusted for non cash expenses  including million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in amortization of acquired technology  million in amortization of deferred compensation  as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities 
we expect net cash used in operating activities will increase substantially assuming favorable results from the esmb s month review of echocardiograms in bloom and that we continue our clinical development programs and hiring of employees  primarily in clinical development 
net cash of million was used in investing activities during the year ended december   and was primarily the result of million used for improvements to our facilities and purchases of equipment and million used to purchase a facility on our san diego campus  partially offset by net proceeds from short term investments of million 
net cash of million was provided by investing activities during the year ended december   and was primarily the result of net proceeds from short term investments of million  partially offset by million used to purchase a facility on our san diego campus and million used for equipment and improvements to our facilities 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million  and was primarily the result of million used for the purchase of equipment and improvements to our facilities  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million 
we expect our capital expenditures will be higher than due to the purchase of our swiss manufacturing facilities in january and planned purchases of equipment and improvements to our san diego facilities  including a major expansion of approximately  square feet at our facility located at nancy ridge drive that is expected to cost approximately million 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december  this was due primarily to net proceeds of million we received in november from the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share  as well as net proceeds of million we received in may from our lease financing transaction and net proceeds of million received from option exercises  purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  and from the equity component of the million payment we received from merck in february  which were partially offset by million in principal payments on our lease financing obligations 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december  due primarily to net proceeds of million and million we received in december and february  respectively  from the sale of shares of our common stock  as well as proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants to purchase our common stock in march net cash of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   and was due primarily to net proceeds of million we received in february from the sale of shares of our common stock and million received in april from our preferred stockholders exercise of their unit warrants 
contractual obligations table the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years series b preferred    operating leases     purchase obligations financing obligations     total      the holders of our series b preferred can require us to redeem all or some of their outstanding shares of series b preferred at any time at such shares stated value  which includes dividends that accrue at annually 
in addition  if not earlier redeemed  we are required to redeem our series b preferred on december  if not previously converted  we are required to redeem the series b preferred on april   at such shares stated value  which includes dividends that accrue at annually 
although we may be able to satisfy all or a portion of these amounts with shares of our common stock if certain criteria are met  the above table includes the full cash redemption price for both series of preferred stock as of december  we have entered into agreements with cros to conduct our clinical trials  and expect to continue to enter into such agreements 
we will make payments to these sites and organizations primarily based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
in determining the amount of our purchase obligations for contracts  we have included only the minimum obligation we have under our contracts which analysis often assumed that such contracts were terminated on december  and did not include any amount which was previously paid  accrued  expensed or associated with a contingent event  such as a change in control or termination of a key employee 
in december  we completed the sale and leaseback of one of our properties for total consideration of million and in may  we completed the sale and leaseback of three of our properties and assigned an option to purchase a fourth property for total consideration of million 
we have accounted for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate and sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
our option to repurchase these properties in the future is considered continued involvement under sfas no 
and  therefore  we have applied the financing method under sfas no 
under the financing method  the book value of the properties and related accumulated depreciation remain on our balance sheet and no sale is recognized 
instead  the sales price of the properties is recorded as a financing obligation and a portion of each lease payment is recorded as interest expense 
at december   we expect interest expense over the term of these leases to total million 
we have included our lease obligations related to these properties in the above table as financing obligations 
at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 our total financing obligation for both of these transactions was million 
the aggregate residual value of the facilities at the end of the lease terms is million 
in january  we entered into strategic cooperation agreements with siegfried ltd 
the agreements include an asset purchase agreement for the purchase from siegfried ltd of certain drug product facility assets  including fixtures  equipment  other personal property and real estate assets in zofingen  switzerland 
we paid chf million  or million  of the cash purchase price in january  and will pay the remaining cash portion of the purchase price of chf million in three equal installments in the third  fourth and fifth years after closing 
this contractual obligation is not included in the above table 
the following is a summary of our significant collaborations as of december  ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ortho mcneil to further develop compounds for the potential treatment of type diabetes and other disorders 
in january  we received a non refundable million upfront payment and two milestone payments of million each  and  in february  we received a million milestone payment related to ortho mcneil s initiation of a phase clinical trial of the then lead drug candidate  apd in september  ortho mcneil exercised its option to extend the research portion of the collaboration through december  beyond which date we no longer perform services or have significant involvement 
based on the data from studies of apd  in january ortho mcneil decided to put apd on hold and has advanced a potentially more potent arena discovered gdir agonist into preclinical development 
we are eligible to receive a total of million in milestone payments for each compound  as well as royalty payments associated with ortho mcneil s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
these milestones include development and approval milestone payments of up to million for the first indication and million for the second indication for each compound  and up to million in sales milestone payments for each product resulting from the collaboration 
from the inception of this collaboration through december   we received million from ortho mcneil in upfront and milestone payments and million in research funding 
we recognized the upfront payment ratably over three years  along with the two milestones received in january as their achievability was reasonably assured at the time we entered into the collaboration 
our agreement with ortho mcneil will continue until the expiration of ortho mcneil s payment obligations under the agreement  unless the agreement is terminated earlier by either party 
we and ortho mcneil each have the right to terminate the agreement early on days prior written notice if the other party commits an uncured material breach of its obligations 
ortho mcneil may terminate the agreement at any time by providing at least days prior written notice 
upon termination of the agreement  all rights to the compounds developed under the collaboration will revert to us 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under the ortho mcneil agreement of million  which included million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  million for patent activities  and million in research funding 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under the ortho mcneil agreement of million  which included million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  million from a milestone earned  million in research funding  and million for additional sponsored research and patent activities 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under this agreement of million  which included million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  million in research funding  and million in additional sponsored research and patent activities 
at december   there were no deferred revenues remaining under this agreement 
merck co  inc in october  we entered into a research and licensing agreement with merck to collaborate on three g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  to develop therapeutics for atherosclerosis and related disorders 
we believe one or more of these gpcrs plays a role in regulating plasma lipid profiles  including hdl cholesterol  the so called good cholesterol  and is responsible for the hdl raising activity of niacin 
in october  we extended and expanded this collaboration  and merck selected one of our compounds for preclinical development 
in february  we amended our merck collaboration to reduce the number of arena research employees funded under the collaboration in exchange for merck making a million equity investment in arena equal to the reduction in their research funding obligation and at approximately a premium to the then current market price 
in september  we announced that merck completed a phase clinical trial of mk  a niacin receptor agonist discovered by us and intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis and related disorders 
based on the results of this trial  merck discontinued development of mk in january  merck initiated a phase clinical trial of a second generation niacin receptor agonist under our partnership for atherosclerosis and other disorders 
from the inception of this collaboration through december   we received million from merck in upfront and milestone payments  and equity investments totaling million 
we may receive additional milestone payments of up to million for merck s clinical and marketing achievements  as well as royalty payments associated with merck s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
in addition  we received research funding from merck through october totaling million when  under our amended agreement  merck s obligation for research funding ended  and beyond which date we no longer perform services or have significant involvement 
our agreement with merck will continue until the expiration of all royalty obligations under the agreement  unless the agreement is terminated early by either party 
either merck or we can terminate our agreement if the other party breaches its material obligations under the agreement by causes and reasons within its control  has not cured such breach within days of receiving a letter requesting such cure  and there is no dispute as to whether such breach has occurred 
the non breaching party in such a termination would receive the rights to continue the program 
in addition  merck can terminate the agreement at anytime by giving days notice  but all milestones and royalties would still be payable as provided in the agreement 
as part of the extension and expansion of our collaboration with merck in october  merck purchased million of our stock at approximately a premium to the then current market price 
we performed an evaluation on this merck stock purchase and determined that million of this million purchase price was an upfront payment related to the collaboration extension and expansion 
accordingly  we recognized the million upfront payment  as well as the remaining portion of the unamortized upfront payment at october of million  over the extended collaboration term of three years 
additionally  in october  we achieved a million milestone under the collaboration which we also recognized over the extended collaboration term of three years because the milestone was reasonably assured to be achieved at the time we extended and expanded this collaboration 
in connection with the february amendment of the collaborative agreement with merck  we performed an evaluation on the stock purchase  which was at a purchase price of per share  and determined that million of the million purchase price was an upfront payment related to the collaboration amendment 
accordingly  we recognized this upfront payment and the unamortized portion of the previously received upfront payments over the remaining term of the research portion of the collaboration 
merck s obligation for research funding ended in october  beyond which date we no longer perform services or have significant involvement 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under the merck agreement of million  which included million in research funding  million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  and million for patent activities 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under the merck agreement of million  which included million in research funding  million from a milestone earned  million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  and million for additional sponsored research and patent activities 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenues under this agreement of million  which included million in research funding  million from amortization of milestones and technology access and development fees received in prior years  and million from a milestone earned 
at december   there were no deferred revenues remaining under this agreement

 which allows an entity to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no

will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or such time when the entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be performed 
eitf issue no 
is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management s judgment 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include clinical trial expenses 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed 
in determining the amount to accrue  we rely on estimates of total costs incurred based on the enrollment of subjects  the completion of studies and other events 
we follow this method because we believe reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a clinical trial can be made 
however  the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending on a number of factors 
differences between the actual clinical trial costs and the estimated clinical trial costs that we have accrued in any prior period are recorded in the subsequent period in which the actual costs become known 
historically  these differences have not been material and we have not had to make material adjustments in the amounts recorded in a subsequent period  however  material differences could occur in the future 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provide guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements 
some of our agreements contain upfront technology access fees  research funding  milestone achievements and royalties 
revenue from a milestone achievement is recognized when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process  iii the milestone payment is non refundable and iv our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone achievement is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
we defer non refundable upfront fees under our collaborations and recognize them over the period in which we have significant involvement or perform services  using various factors specific to each collaboration 
amounts we receive for research funding for a specified number of full time researchers are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
advance payments we receive in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenues until earned 
share based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior period results are not restated 
compensation expense recognized subsequent to adoption includes i compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but unvested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
using the black scholes option pricing model  and ii compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model is based on the exercise price of the award and our stock price on the date of grant  as well as assumptions for expected volatility  the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can have a material impact on the compensation expense we recognize 
expected volatility for awards granted after adoption of sfas no 
r is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock  with historical volatility being more heavily weighted due to the low volume of traded options on our common stock 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  our computation of expected volatility was based only on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options granted under sfas no 
r is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards  vesting schedules and post vesting cancellations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  an average expected life of five years was used in determining the fair value of option grants based on the vesting period of the options and the short period of time our stock had been publicly traded 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve  with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term used in the option pricing model 
as compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures do vary from estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest 
for the year ended december   we recorded total non cash  share based compensation expense of million 
accounting for lease financing obligations 
we have accounted for our sale leaseback transactions in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
our option to repurchase these properties in the future is considered continued involvement under sfas no 
and  therefore  we have applied the financing method under sfas no 
under the financing method  the book value of the properties and related accumulated depreciation remain on our balance sheet and no sale is recognized 
instead  the sales price of the properties is recorded as a financing obligation  and a portion of each lease payment is recorded as interest expense 
we estimated and apply an incremental borrowing rate to the lease payments to record interest expense 
intangibles 
purchase accounting requires estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets received and liabilities assumed 
in february  we acquired bunsen rush laboratories  inc for million in cash and assumed million in liabilities 
we allocated million to the patented melanophore technology acquired in such transaction 
the melanophore technology  our primary screening technology  is being amortized over its estimated useful life of years  which was determined based on an analysis  as of the acquisition date  of the conditions in  and the economic outlook for  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and the patent life of the technology 
as with any intangible asset  we will continue to evaluate the value of the melanophore technology 
if  in the future  we determine that the melanophore technology has become impaired or we no longer use it internally as our primary screening technology  we may record a write down of the carrying value or we will accelerate the amortization if we determine that its life has been shortened 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report  which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
income taxes as of december   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of federal research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes which expire on various dates beginning in these amounts reflect different treatment of expenses for financial reporting and for tax purposes 
united states tax law contains provisions that may limit our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any year  including if there has been a significant ownership change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our management establishes and oversees the implementation of board approved policies covering our investments 
we manage our market risk in accordance with our investment guidelines which i emphasize preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations  ii require investments to be placed in us government and agency obligations and in debt instruments that are rated investment grade  iii establish guidelines for the diversification of our investment portfolio  and iv require investments to be placed with maturities that maintain safety and liquidity 
we target our portfolio to have an average duration of no more than four years with no one instrument having a duration exceeding five years and one month 
we do not invest in derivative instruments  or any financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary market risk exposure as it affects our cash equivalents  short term investments  and securities available for sale is interest rate risk 
we monitor our interest rate risk on a periodic basis and we ensure that our cash equivalents  short term investments  and securities available for sale are invested in accordance with our investments guidelines 
managing credit ratings and the duration of our financial investments enhances the preservation of our capital 
we model interest rate exposure by a sensitivity analysis that assumes a hypothetical parallel shift downward in the us treasury yield curve of basis points 
under these assumptions  if the yield curve were to shift lower by basis points from the level existing at december   we would expect future interest income from our portfolio to decline by less than million over the next months 
as of december   this same hypothetical reduction in interest rates would have resulted in a decline in interest income of less than million over the months following december  the difference in these two estimates is due to the difference in our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and securities available for sale between the two periods 
the model we use is not intended to forecast actual losses in interest income  but is used as a risk estimation and investment management tool 
these hypothetical changes and assumptions are likely to be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  such computations do not incorporate actions our management could take if the hypothetical interest rate changes actually occur 
as a result  the impact on actual earnings will likely differ from those quantified herein 
we have a wholly owned subsidiary in switzerland  which exposes us to foreign exchange risk 
the functional currency of our subsidiary in switzerland is the swiss franc 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of our subsidiary are translated to us dollars based on the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
expense components are translated to us dollars at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of our stockholders equity 
other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in our results of operations and  to date  have not been significant 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instrument  but may do so in the future
