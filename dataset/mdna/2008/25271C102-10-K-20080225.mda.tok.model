item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling with a fleet of offshore drilling rigs 
our fleet currently consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
in addition  we have two jack up drilling units under construction at shipyards in brownsville  texas and singapore 
we expect both of these units to be delivered during the second quarter of overview industry conditions worldwide demand for our mid water intermediate and deepwater high specification semisubmersible rigs remained strong throughout the year and into the jack up market in the us gulf of mexico  however  continues to experience reduced demand  resulting in downward pricing pressure and some of our jack up rigs being ready stacked for periods of time between wells 
exclusive of the gom jack up market  which accounted for nine percent of our total revenue for the year ended december   solid fundamental market conditions remain in place for all classes of our offshore drilling rigs worldwide 
gulf of mexico 
in the gom  the market for our high specification semisubmersible equipment remains firm 
one of our high specification rigs is contracted for work in the gom until late in the fourth quarter of  while the remaining seven high specification rigs currently located in the gom have contracts that extend well into and beyond  including two at dayrates as high as  for future work 
in many cases  these contracts also include un priced option periods that have neither been exercised nor have expired 
as of the date of this report  dayrates for intermediate semisubmersibles in the gom  where we currently have one such unit operating  are ranging between  and  during  strong international demand offering lengthy terms encouraged us to obtain international contracts for four of our intermediate rigs that were previously located in the gom 
all but one of these rigs has left the gom 
the fourth unit is in a shipyard in brownsville for a survey and life extension project 
we expect this rig to depart the gom in the second quarter of for brazil 
we continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the gom as under supplied and believe that the gom semisubmersible market will remain strong in our jack up fleet in the gom continued to experience lower utilization and dayrates during the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  as four of our seven available rigs were ready stacked for periods of time and average dayrates declined slightly from those earned during the third quarter of as of january   all seven of our available jack ups in the gom were on contract  although the well to well nature of the market persists 
the international market for jack ups remains generally strong 
as a result  we signed a two year term extension with kodeco energy co 
ltd 
for the ocean sovereign in indonesia at a dayrate in the mid  s that is expected to commence in the second quarter of the mobilization of the ocean columbia from the gom to mexico also was completed during the fourth quarter of  and that unit began operating in the first quarter of we believe that the current market environment for jack up rigs  both in the gom and internationally  will continue at least through the first quarter of brazil 
during  we added two semisubmersible rigs to our fleet in brazil  where we currently have five semisubmersibles and one drillship operating 
two additional semisubmersible units  the ocean yorktown and ocean worker  are expected to commence operations there in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
our drillship is contracted until the end of of our other seven rigs that are or are expected to be working offshore brazil in  one is contracted until and two each are contracted until  and in late  petrobras announced the discovery of an ultra deep atlantic ocean field with as much as billion barrels of crude oil 
in early  petrobras also announced the discovery of a large natural gas reserve off the coast of rio de janeiro that may more than equal the size of the crude oil discovery 
we expect the brazilian floater market to remain strong during 
table of contents north sea 
effective semisubmersible utilization remains at percent in the north sea where we have three semisubmersible rigs in the uk and one semisubmersible unit in norway 
the current contract for one of our four rigs in the north sea extends until the second quarter of  and the other three rigs have term contracts that extend into australia asia middle east mediterranean 
we currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up unit operating in the australia asia market  and three jack up rigs and one semisubmersible rig located in the middle east mediterranean sector 
during the fourth quarter of  the semisubmersible ocean general received a letter of intent  or loi  for two years of work in vietnam at a dayrate in the low  s 
we believe that the australia asia middle east and mediterranean floater markets will remain strong during contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and reflects both firm commitments typically represented by signed contracts  as well as previously disclosed lois 
an loi is subject to customary conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement 
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods is a function of both the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts 
october  february  february  in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups total contract drilling backlog as of february  includes an aggregate million in contract drilling revenue relating to expected future work under an loi 
the following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of february  for the years ending december  total in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups total includes an aggregate million in contract drilling revenue of which approximately million  million and million is expected to be earned during  and  respectively  relating to expected future work under an loi 

table of contents the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of february  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts and lois  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet to total available days number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for the ocean monarch  and our two new build jack up rigs  the ocean scepter and ocean shield 
for the years ending december  rig days committed high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups includes approximately  and scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for and  respectively 
general our revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
the two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive fees either lump sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most 
table of contents significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
we have experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strong offshore drilling market and increased competition for skilled workers 
in response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs  including increases in compensation 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
periods of high  sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper  working order 
in addition  during periods of high activity and dayrates  higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses  which cause our costs for goods and services to increase 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
during  we expect rigs in our fleet to undergo year or intermediate surveys at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately million  including estimated mobilization costs  but excluding any resulting repair and maintenance costs  which could be significant 
costs of mobilizing our rigs to shipyards for scheduled surveys  which were a major component of our survey related costs during  are indicative of higher prices commanded by support businesses to the offshore drilling industry 
we expect mobilization costs to be a significant component of our survey related costs in for physical damage due to named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico  as of the date of this report our deductible is million per occurrence or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss with an annual aggregate limit of million 
accordingly  our insurance coverage for all physical damage to our rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico for the policy period ending april  is limited to million 
if named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico cause significant damage to our rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which we may be liable  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
insurance premiums will be amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of april 
table of contents construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 capitalization of interest cost  or sfas during and  we began capitalizing interest with respect to expenditures related to our upgrade of the ocean monarch and the construction of our two new jack up rigs 
pursuant to sfas  the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
prior to the completion of our upgrade of the ocean endeavor in march  we capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures on that project beginning in april see note general information capitalized interest to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
during  we expect to complete the upgrade of the ocean monarch and to accept delivery of the newly constructed ocean scepter and ocean shield 
we will continue to capitalize interest costs related to this upgrade until sea trials and commissioning of the ocean monarch are completed and the rig is loaded on a heavy lift vessel for its return to the gom  which we anticipate will occur late in the fourth quarter of we expect to continue capitalizing interest costs in connection with the construction of our two jack up rigs until sea trials and commissioning of the rigs are complete  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of accordingly  we will then cease capitalizing interest costs related to these projects and will begin depreciating the newly upgraded constructed rigs 
as a result of the scheduled delivery of these rigs  we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in will increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  and salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant as part of our analysis 
as of december   all of our drilling rigs were either under contract or were in shipyards for surveys  contract modifications or major upgrade  except for two of our jack up drilling rigs located in the gom 
at december   one of these idle units was under contract but waiting to begin drilling operations while the other unit was being actively marketed 
we did not have any cold stacked rigs at december  we do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 

table of contents management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily results from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million or million if hurricane related per occurrence  with no aggregate deductible 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we engage experts to assist us in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
for interim periods  we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax  taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a long term tax receivable of million and a long term tax liability of million for uncertain tax positions  the net of which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
we record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations  including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations

table of contents demand remained strong for our rigs in all markets and geographic regions during  except for the jack up market in the gom 
continued high overall utilization and historically high dayrates contributed to an overall increase in our net income of million  or  to million in compared to million in in many of the markets in which we operate  dayrates continued to increase compared to resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet 
however  overall revenue increases were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys  as well as the temporary ready stacking of drilling rigs between wells in the gom jack up market 
total contract drilling revenues in increased million  or  to billion compared to billion in total contract drilling expenses increased million  or  in  compared to  to billion 
overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between and reflect the impact of high  sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet  additional survey and related maintenance costs  contract preparation and mobilization costs  as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the newly upgraded ocean endeavor 
the increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses 
our results were also impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities in and compensation increases during and depreciation and general and administrative expenses increased million in the aggregate  or in  compared to  reducing our net income by million in net income for includes million of non recurring us federal income tax expense related to the distribution of previously untaxed earnings from one of our foreign subsidiaries

revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore mexico increased million in compared to the relocation of the ocean new era and ocean voyager from the gom to mexico in the fourth quarter of generated an additional million in revenues for this region in revenues generated in were reduced by million due to the return of the ocean whittington in july and the ocean worker and ocean yorktown in the third quarter of to the gom 
our operating costs in mexico increased by million in compared to  primarily due to the inclusion of operating costs for the ocean new era and ocean voyager and costs to mobilize the ocean worker and ocean yorktown from mexico to the gom 
the overall increase in costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs for the ocean whittington in and reduced normal operating costs for the ocean worker and ocean yorktown beginning in the third quarter of australia asia middle east 
our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the australia asia middle east regions generated revenues of million in compared to revenues of million in the million increase in operating revenue was primarily due to an increase in average operating revenue per day from  in to  in  which generated additional revenues of million during the increase in average operating revenue per day is primarily attributable to an increase in the contractual dayrates earned by the ocean patriot that occurred in the third quarter of  and the ocean epoch and ocean general that occurred during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
average utilization in this region decreased to during from utilization during  primarily due to days of incremental unpaid downtime in  as compared to  for repairs as well as a survey of the ocean general and an environmental survey of the ocean patriot and related removal of an invasive species of green  lipped mussels that had attached itself to the rig while working offshore new zealand 
the decline in utilization during reduced revenues by million

during  we recognized million in mobilization revenue for the relocation of the ocean patriot to new zealand 
contract drilling expense for the australia asia middle east region increased million in compared to the increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher labor and personnel related costs  including higher local labor costs for the ocean epoch  which relocated to australia in the fourth quarter of from malaysia 
other cost increases for our rigs operating in this region during  as compared to  include higher repair and maintenance costs  higher freight costs and additional costs associated with the environmental survey of the ocean patriot 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower agency fee costs incurred by the ocean epoch in compared to when the rig was operating offshore malaysia 
europe africa mediterranean 
operating revenue for our intermediate semisubmersibles working in the europe africa mediterranean regions increased million in compared to overall utilization during increased primarily due to the relocation of the ocean lexington million from the gom to offshore egypt in the fourth quarter of additionally  the ocean princess generated additional revenues of million during compared to when the rig had days of downtime for an intermediate survey and related repairs 
these favorable variances resulting from the increased utilization of two of our rigs in this region were partially offset by days of unpaid downtime for an intermediate survey of the ocean vanguard that reduced revenues by million in also during  we recognized million in revenues related to the amortization of lump sum fees received from customers for capital improvements to the ocean guardian and ocean vanguard 
average operating revenue per day for our north sea semisubmersibles increased from  in to  in  contributing million in additional revenue in as compared to the overall increase in average operating revenue per day in this market was primarily due to higher dayrates earned by the ocean nomad  ocean guardian and ocean vanguard during contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the europe africa mediterranean markets increased million in compared to  primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs for the ocean lexington million 
increased operating expenses in are also reflective of higher labor and benefits costs incurred in for our rigs operating in the north sea  including the effect of compensation increases and implementation of a retention plan  and higher shorebase support 
table of contents costs 
however  overall operating expense increases in this region during were partially offset by lower mobilization and inspection costs associated with surveys  as costs incurred for the ocean vanguard s intermediate survey in december were well below aggregate expenses related to surveys for the ocean guardian and ocean princess in south america

revenue generated by our jack up rigs operating in the gom decreased million during compared to the decline in revenues is primarily due to the relocation of three of our jack up rigs from the gom to other markets the ocean king to croatia in the third quarter of  the ocean nugget to mexico in the fourth quarter of  and the ocean spur to tunisia in the first quarter of these rigs generated million in revenues while operating in the gom in compared to only million earned by the ocean king in the gom during in addition  the ocean columbia  which was in a shipyard for a majority of the fourth quarter of for preparation work in connection with an month contract offshore mexico  generated revenues of million in the gom during compared to million in average utilization excluding the ocean columbia  ocean king  ocean nugget and ocean spur declined from during to during resulting in a reduction in revenues of million 
the decline in utilization was primarily in response to market conditions in the gom that caused us to ready stack certain of our jack up rigs for a portion of time between wells  scheduled downtime for surveys of the ocean crusader and ocean tower and contract preparation activities for the ocean columbia 
the ocean columbia departed the gom for mexico at the end of the fourth quarter of

average operating revenue per day in  excluding the ocean columbia  ocean king  ocean nugget and ocean spur  decreased to  from  in  resulting in a million decrease in revenue from contract drilling expense in the gom increased million in compared to the overall increase in costs was primarily due to higher survey and related repair costs in  contract preparation activities for the ocean columbia  as well as increased repair and ready stacking costs for several of our rigs marketed in the gom 
in addition  operating costs for our rigs in this market were negatively impacted by regular salary increases and higher overhead costs 
the overall increase in operating costs was partially offset by the absence of operating costs in the gom for the ocean nugget and ocean spur and lower operating costs for the ocean king during  which reduced operating expenses by million

cash flows from operations 
our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the geographic regions in which we operate 
deterioration in the offshore drilling market or poor operating results may result in reduced cash flows from operations 
the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace  which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  a variety of political and economic factors and availability of rigs in a particular geographic region 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
these external factors which affect our cash flows from operations are not within our control and are difficult to predict

liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes

table of contents credit ratings 
our current credit rating is baa for moody s investors services and a for standard poor s 
although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels  lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our credit facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances 
capital expenditures 
the newly upgraded ocean endeavor commenced drilling operations in the gom in early july the aggregate cost of the upgrade was approximately million of which million was spent in in addition  the upgrade of the ocean monarch continues in singapore with expected delivery of the upgraded rig late in the fourth quarter of we expect to spend approximately million to modernize this rig of which million had been spent through december  construction of our two high performance  premium jack up rigs  the ocean scepter and ocean shield is nearing completion  and delivery of both units is expected in the second quarter of the aggregate expected cost for both rigs is approximately million  including drill pipe and capitalized interest  of which million had been spent through december  during  we spent approximately million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program other than rig upgrades and new construction and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements  including million towards modification of certain of our rigs to meet contractual requirements 
we have budgeted approximately million in additional capital expenditures in associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  equipment required for our long term international contracts and other corporate requirements 
we expect to finance our capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds 
from time to time  however  we may also make use of our credit facility to finance capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december  and  we had no off balance sheet debt or other arrangements 
current credit environment 
recent developments in the financial markets  including a series of rating agency downgrades of sub prime us mortgage related assets and significant provisions for loan losses recorded by several major financial institutions  have caused the fair value of sub prime related investments to decline 
this decline in fair value has become especially problematic for certain large financial institutions and has had an effect through the us economy  including limiting access to capital markets to certain borrowers at reasonable rates and also affecting the market value of certain investments whether or not linked to sub prime mortgages 
the fair value of our investments in debt securities  comprised of us government securities or us government backed mortgage securities  have not to date been materially negatively impacted by events in the current credit market 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not any such investments will be impacted in the future or how our customers and or suppliers will be affected by the current credit conditions 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and capital projects for the next twelve months  however  we may also make use of our credit facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes 
our credit facility matures in we do not anticipate that these current credit market conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents historical cash flows the following is a discussion of our historical cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities 
year ended december  change in thousands net income net changes in operating assets and liabilities gain loss on sale of marketable securities depreciation and other non cash items  net our cash flows from operations in increased million or over net cash generated by our operating activities in the increase in cash flow from operations in is primarily the result of higher average dayrates by our rigs as a result of continued high worldwide demand for offshore contract drilling services in compared to the favorable contribution to cash flows was partially offset by lower utilization of our offshore drilling units due to planned downtime for modifications to our rigs to meet customer requirements and regulatory surveys  as well as the ready stacking of rigs within our gom jack up fleet between wells 
in addition  the increase in cash flows from operations was augmented by a decrease in cash required to satisfy our working capital requirements

during  we paid cash dividends totaling million consisting of quarterly dividends of million in the aggregate  or per share of our common stock per quarter  and a special cash dividend of per share of our common stock  totaling million 
on february   we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend and a special cash dividend of and  respectively  per share of our common stock 
both the quarterly and special cash dividends are payable on march  to stockholders of record on february  in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors adopted a policy of considering paying special cash dividends  in amounts to be determined  on a quarterly basis  rather than annually 
our board of directors may  in subsequent quarters  consider paying additional special cash dividends  in amounts to be determined  if it believes that our financial position  earnings  earnings outlook  capital spending plans and other relevant factors warrant such action at that time 
depending on market conditions  we may  from time to time  purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise 
we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during the years ended december  and other currency risk 
some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations 
currency environments in which we have significant business operations include mexico  brazil  the uk  australia and malaysia 
when possible  we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
at present  however  only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk 
a forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates 
we record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that 
table of contents choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
the objective of sfas is to help mitigate this type of volatility in the earnings by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have completed our evaluation of the impact of applying sfas on our financial statements and have determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which establishes a separate framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was issued to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  however  its adoption may result in changes to current practice 
changes resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  rather than an entity specific measurement 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between i market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources and ii the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have completed our evaluation of the impact of applying sfas on our financial statements and have determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows

our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates

table of contents our long term debt  as of december  and december   is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
during and  we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts that required us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates 
as of december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding  which aggregated million  that require us to purchase the equivalent of million in british pounds sterling and million in mexican pesos at various times through april as of december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding  which aggregated million  that required us to purchase the equivalent of million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner at various times through june at december   we have presented the  and  fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts in accordance with sfas no
