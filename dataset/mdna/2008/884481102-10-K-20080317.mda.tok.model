we use these specialized events to showcase companies to institutional investors focused on investing in these growth sectors 
we believe that our conferences differentiate us from smaller investment banks that may lack the relationships and resources to host broadly attended industry events 
asset management our asset management division is divided into three principal units i private investment funds  ii public equity investment products and iii distribution management 

table of contents private investment funds

the fund was formed in with a capital commitment of million  million of which has been invested as of december  thomas weisel india opportunity fund is a fund of funds targeting venture capital and private equity funds primarily investing in growth businesses in india 
the fund was formed in with a capital commitment of million  million of which has been invested as of december  thomas weisel venture partners is a venture capital fund that invests in information technology companies  particularly in the broadly defined software and communications industries 
the fund was formed in with a capital commitment of approximately million  million of which has been invested as of december  in the future we expect to continue to sponsor and raise follow on or new investment funds 
for certain of the funds for which we are a general partner we also act as manager of the fund and receive management fees generally based on committed capital or net assets of the partnerships 
public equity investment products 
we have a small mid cap growth public equity investment team based in portland  oregon 
between the hiring of this team in the fourth quarter of and december   we have provided approximately million of seed investment capital for the products they manage 
this public equity investment team manages these products through an asset management subsidiary and collectively is entitled to receive approximately of the profits generated

none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements

table of contents competition as an investment bank  all aspects of our business are intensely competitive 
our competitors are investment banking firms  other brokerage firms  merchant banks and financial advisory firms 
we compete with some of our competitors nationally or regionally and with others on a product or service basis 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital and resources than we do and offer a broader range of financial products 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our business include client relationships  reputation  the abilities of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
in recent years there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry 
legislative and regulatory changes in the united states have allowed commercial banks to enter businesses previously limited to investment banks  and a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired broker dealers or merged with other financial institutions 
this trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors 
many of our competitors have the ability to offer a wider range of products and services that may enhance their competitive position 
they may also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products and services with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services capabilities in an effort to gain market share  which could result in pricing pressure in our businesses 
we experience price competition with respect to our investment banking business 
one trend  particularly in the equity underwriting business  toward multiple book runners and co managers has increased the competitive pressure in the investment banking industry and may lead to lower average transaction fees 
we also experience intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions 
the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pricing pressure on trading commissions and spreads  as well as affected the volume of trades being executed through traditional full service platforms 
we believe that this trend toward alternative trading systems will continue 
in addition  we experience competition with respect to our asset management business both in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds and products and in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies for our investment funds 
we compete for individual and institutional clients on the basis of price  the range of products we offer  the quality of our services as well as on the basis of financial resources available to us and invested in our products 
we may be competing with other investors and corporate buyers for the investments that we make 
we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future  including if some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices 
competition is also intense for the recruitment and retention of qualified professionals 
our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our continued ability to attract new professionals and retain and motivate our existing professionals

item a 
risk factors we face a variety of risks in our business  many of which are substantial and inherent in our business and operations 
the following are some of the important risk factors that could affect our business  our industry and holders of our common stock 
these risks are not exhaustive 
other sections of this annual report on form k may include additional factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 

table of contents risks related to our business we focus principally on specific sectors of the economy  and a deterioration in the business environment in these sectors generally or decline in the market for securities of companies within these sectors could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we focus principally on the technology  healthcare  consumer  energy and mining sectors of the economy 
therefore  volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally  or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors particularly  could substantially affect our financial results and the market value of our common stock 
the business environment for companies in these sectors can experience substantial volatility  and our financial results may consequently be subject to significant variations from year to year 
the market for securities in each of our focus sectors may also be subject to industry specific risks 
for example  changes in policies by the united states food and drug administration may affect the market for securities of biotechnology and healthcare companies and volatility in the commodities markets may affect the market for securities of energy or mining companies that operate in the affected markets 
underwriting transactions  strategic advisory engagements and related trading activities in our focus sectors represent a significant portion of our businesses 
this concentration exposes us to the risk of substantial declines in revenues in the event of downturns in these sectors of the economy 
any future downturns in our focus sectors could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our financial results may fluctuate substantially from period to period  which may impair our stock price 
we have experienced  and expect to experience in the future  significant periodic variations in our revenues and results of operations 
these variations may be attributed in part to the fact that our investment banking revenues are typically earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  the timing of which is uncertain and beyond our control 
in most cases we receive little or no payment for investment banking engagements that do not result in the successful completion of a transaction 
as a result  our business is highly dependent on market conditions as well as the decisions and actions of our clients and interested third parties 
for example  a client s acquisition transaction may be delayed or terminated because of a failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to obtain necessary regulatory consents or board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  adverse market conditions or unexpected financial or other problems in the client s or counterparty s business 
if the parties fail to complete a transaction on which we are advising or an offering in which we are participating  we will earn little or no revenue from the transaction 
this risk may be intensified by our focus on growth companies in the technology  healthcare  consumer  energy and mining sectors  as the market for securities of many of these companies has experienced significant variations in the number and size of equity offerings 
recently  more companies initiating the process of an initial public offering are simultaneously exploring merger and acquisition opportunities 
if we are not engaged as a strategic advisor in any such dual tracked process  our investment banking revenues would be adversely affected in the event that an initial public offering is not consummated 
in addition  our investments and warrants we receive from time to time as compensation for investment banking services are adjusted to fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles at the end of each quarter  which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings 
as a result  we are unlikely to achieve steady and predictable earnings on a quarterly basis  which could in turn adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals is critical to the success of our business  and our failure to do so may materially adversely affect our reputation  business and results of operations 
our ability to obtain and successfully execute our business depends upon the personal reputation  judgment  business generation capabilities and project execution skills of our senior professionals  particularly thomas w 
weisel  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  lionel f 
conacher  our president and chief operating officer  and the other members of our executive committee 
our senior professionals personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagements 
we encounter intense competition for qualified employees from other companies in the investment banking industry as well as from businesses outside the investment banking industry  such as investment advisory firms  hedge funds  private equity funds and venture capital funds 
from time to time  we have experienced losses of investment banking  brokerage  research and other professionals  and losses of our key personnel may occur in the future 
for example  during we experienced the departures of blake j 
jorgensen and robert w 
kitts  who were our co directors of investment banking and members of our executive committee at the beginning of in addition  since january  we have announced that two other officers who were members of our executive committee at the beginning of david a 
baylor  our chief financial officer  and stephen j 
buell  our former director of research will be resigning to pursue other opportunities 
the departure or other loss of mr 
weisel  mr 
conacher  any other member of our executive committee or any other senior professional who manages substantial client relationships and possesses substantial experience and expertise  could impair our ability to secure or successfully complete engagements  protect our market share or retain assets under management  each of which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
certain of our investment funds may be subject to key man provisions which  upon the departure or other loss of some or all of the investment professionals managing the fund  may permit the investors in the fund to dissolve the fund or may result in a reduction of the management fees paid with respect to the investment fund 
in connection with our initial public offering and our conversion to corporate form  many of our professionals received substantial amounts of common stock in exchange for their membership interests 
ownership of  and the ability to realize equity value from  our common stock  unlike that of membership interests in thomas weisel partners group llc the predecessor to thomas weisel partners group  inc  does not depend upon continued employment and our professionals are not restricted from leaving us by the potential loss of the value of their ownership interests 
similarly  in connection with our acquisition of westwind  many of the westwind professionals received substantial amounts of common stock or shares exchangeable for common stock in consideration of their ownership interests in westwind 
ownership of  and the ability to realize equity value from our common stock or shares exchangeable for our common stock  unlike that of ownership interests in westwind  does not depend on continued employment and these professionals are not restricted from leaving us by potential loss of the value of their ownership interests 
these shares of common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock are subject to certain restrictions on transfer and a portion are pledged to secure liquidated damages obligations to us as set forth in the partners equity agreement and the westwind capital corporation shareholders equity agreement  each of which has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
however  these agreements will survive for only a limited period and will permit any professional that is party thereto to leave us without losing any of their shares of common stock or shares exchangeable for common stock if they comply with these agreements  and  in some cases  compliance with these agreements may also be waived 
consequently  the steps we have taken to encourage the continued service of these individuals after our initial public offering may not be effective 
in connection with our acquisition of westwind  any management disruption or difficulties in integrating thomas weisel partners and westwind s professionals could result in a loss of clients and customers or revenues from clients and customers and could significantly affect our business and results of operations 
the success of the westwind transaction depends in part on our ability to retain our personnel  including personnel formerly employed by westwind 
it is possible that these employees might decide not to remain with us as we continue to integrate the companies 
if key employees terminate their employment  or 
table of contents insufficient numbers of employees are retained to maintain effective operations  our business activities might be adversely affected  management s attention might be diverted from successfully continuing to integrate westwind s operations to hiring suitable replacements  and our business might suffer 
if any of our professionals were to join an existing competitor or form a competing company  some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
the compensation arrangements  non competition agreements and lock up agreements we have entered into with certain of our professionals may not prove effective in preventing them from resigning to join our competitors and the non competition agreements may not be upheld if we were to seek to enforce our rights under these agreements 
if we are unable to retain our professionals or recruit additional professionals  our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our efforts to limit compensation and benefits expense may hinder our ability to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals 
in connection with our initial public offering  we announced that we intended to target aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering within the range of to of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities 
our compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering and excluding the one time compensation expense in the fourth quarter of attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses  each of which were related to the integration of westwind  as a percentage of net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities was for the year ended december  including the one time compensation expense in the fourth quarter discussed above  our compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to equity awards made in connection with our initial public offering  as a percentage of net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities was for the year ended december  we do not intend to have a target ratio of aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense to net revenues in and subsequent years 
competitive pressures may require that our compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenues increase in order to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals 
further  new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before realizing associated additional revenues 
additionally  we have granted equity awards in connection with our ipo and as part of our compensation and hiring process  the full expense of which is recognized pro rata over a three or four year vesting period 
the future expense associated with these grants and grants in and thereafter could result in an increase to our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to net revenues in and subsequent years 
the following table represents the amount of compensation expense we have recorded during the years ended december  and  as well as compensation expense we expect to record in future years for share based awards granted through march  amounts in thousands year expense is year of grant recorded total thereafter total includes share based awards granted through march  
table of contents pricing and other competitive pressures may impair the revenues and profitability of our brokerage business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our brokerage business 
along with other brokerage firms  we have experienced intense price competition in this business in recent years 
in particular  the ability to execute trades electronically and through other alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions  volume and spreads and has required us to make investments in our brokerage business in order to compete 
we expect this trend toward alternative trading systems to continue 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
in addition  we face pressure from our larger competitors  which may be better able to offer a broader range of complementary products and services to brokerage clients in order to win their trading business 
as we are committed to maintaining our comprehensive research coverage to support our brokerage business  we may be required to make substantial investments in our research capabilities 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors in these areas  brokerage revenues may decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
difficult market conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways 
difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways 
weakness in equity markets and diminished trading volume of securities could adversely impact our brokerage business 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions transactions also would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues 
in addition  reductions in the trading prices for equity securities also tend to reduce the deal value of investment banking transactions  such as underwritings and mergers and acquisitions transactions  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn from these transactions 
also  difficult market conditions would likely decrease the value of assets under management in our asset management and private client business  which would decrease the amount of asset based fees we receive  and may also affect our ability to attract additional  or retain existing  assets under management within these businesses 
as we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profits and profit margins may decline 
as an investment bank focused principally on the growth sectors of the economy  we depend significantly on transactions by venture capital backed companies for sources of revenues and potential business opportunities 
to the extent venture capital investment activities slow down due to difficult market conditions or otherwise  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  as we are headquartered in california and a substantial percentage of our growth company clients are located in california  a natural disaster or a regional economic downturn in california could harm our business even when the market conditions elsewhere are not affected 
with respect to the energy and mining sectors  any prolonged  substantial reduction in commodity prices may affect the activity levels of companies in those sectors and the consequent demand for our products and services from those companies 
adverse market or economic conditions or a slowdown of activity in the sectors in which the portfolio companies of our investment funds operate could have an adverse effect on the earnings of those portfolio companies  and therefore  our earnings 
we face strong competition from larger firms 
the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries are intensely competitive  and we expect them to remain so 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including client relationships  reputation  the abilities and past performance of our professionals  market focus and the relative quality and price of our services and products 
we have experienced intense price competition with respect to our brokerage business  including large block trades  spreads and trading commissions  as well as competition due to the increased use of commission sharing arrangements 
pricing and other 
table of contents competitive pressures in investment banking  including the trends toward multiple book runners  co managers and multiple financial advisors handling transactions  have continued and could adversely affect our revenues  even during periods where the volume and number of investment banking transactions are increasing 
competitive factors with respect to our asset management activities include the amount of firm capital we can invest in new products and our ability to increase assets under management  including our ability to attract capital for new investment funds 
we believe we may experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by competing on the basis of price 
we are a relatively small investment bank with approximately employees as of march  and net revenues of million in many of our competitors in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries have a broader range of products and services  greater financial and marketing resources  larger customer bases  greater name recognition  more senior professionals to serve their clients needs  greater global reach and more established relationships with clients than we have 
these larger and better capitalized competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the brokerage  investment banking and asset management industries  to compete for skilled professionals  to finance acquisitions  to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally 
the scale of our competitors has increased over time as a result of substantial consolidation among companies in the brokerage and investment banking industries 
in addition  a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired underwriting or financial advisory practices and broker dealers or have merged with other financial institutions 
these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do  which may enhance their competitive position 
they also have the ability to support investment banking with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services in an effort to gain market share  which has resulted  and could further result  in pricing pressure in our businesses 
in particular  the ability to provide financing has become an important advantage for some of our larger competitors and  because we do not provide such financing  we may be unable to compete as effectively for clients in a significant part of the brokerage and investment banking market 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we have incurred losses and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses in the recent past 
we recorded net losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we also recorded net losses in certain quarters within including the third and fourth quarters of and other past fiscal years 
we may incur losses in any of our future periods 
if we are unable to finance future losses  those losses may have a significant effect on our liquidity as well as our ability to operate 
in addition  we may incur significant expenses in connection with initiating new business activities or in connection with any expansion of our underwriting  brokerage or asset management businesses 
we may also engage in strategic acquisitions and investments for which we may incur significant expenses 
accordingly  we will need to increase our revenues at a rate greater than our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently  or even if our revenues increase but we are unable to manage our expenses  we will not achieve and maintain profitability in future periods 
our capital markets and strategic advisory engagements are singular in nature and do not generally provide for subsequent engagements 
our strategy is to take a lifecycle approach in providing investment banking services to our clients  however  our investment banking clients generally retain us on a short term  engagement by engagement basis in connection with specific capital markets or mergers and acquisitions transactions  rather than on a recurring basis under long term contracts 
as these transactions are typically singular in nature and our engagements with these clients may not recur  we must seek out new engagements when our current 
table of contents engagements are successfully completed or are terminated 
as a result  high activity levels in any period are not necessarily indicative of continued high levels of activity in any subsequent period 
if we are unable to generate a substantial number of new engagements and generate fees from the successful completion of these transactions  our business and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
a significant portion of our brokerage revenues are generated from a relatively small number of institutional clients 
for example  in we generated of our brokerage revenues  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
similarly  in we generated of our brokerage revenues  or approximately of our net revenues  from our ten largest brokerage clients 
if any of our key clients departs or reduces its business with us and we fail to attract new clients that are capable of generating significant trading volumes  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
poor investment performance  pricing pressure and other competitive factors may reduce our asset management revenues or result in losses 
as part of our strategy  we are investing in the expansion of our asset management business 
our revenues from this business are primarily derived from management fees which are based on committed capital and or assets under management and incentive fees  which are earned if the return of our investment funds exceeds certain threshold returns 
our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors  including investors perception of our past performance  market or economic conditions  competition from other fund managers and our ability to negotiate terms with major investors 
investment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new asset management and private equity business and our historical performance may not be indicative of future results 
poor investment performance and other competitive factors could reduce our revenues and impair our growth in many ways existing clients may withdraw funds from our asset management business in favor of better performing products  our incentive fees could decline or be eliminated entirely  firms with which we have business relationships may terminate these relationships with us  our capital investments in our investment funds or the seed capital we have committed to new asset management products may diminish in value or may be lost  and our key employees in the business may depart  whether to join a competitor or otherwise 
our investment funds include gains and losses that have not yet been realized through sales or other transactions 
the ultimate realization of these gains and losses will depend on whether these funds achieve satisfactory investment performance 
these unrealized gains and losses are recognized in our results of operations because these investments are accounted for in accordance with gaap using the fair value method based on the percentage interest in the underlying partnerships 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on quoted market prices  or estimated fair value if there is no public market 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  which differences could be material  and these differences may result in increased volatility in our asset management revenues 
to the extent our future investment performance is perceived to be poor in either relative or absolute terms  our asset management revenues will likely be reduced and our ability to raise new funds will 
table of contents likely be impaired 
even when market conditions are generally favorable  our investment performance may be adversely affected by our investment style and the particular investments that we make 
in addition  over the past several years  the size and number of investment funds  including exchange traded funds  hedge funds and private equity funds  has continued to increase 
if this trend continues  it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to raise capital for new investment funds or price competition may mean that we are unable to maintain our current fee structure 
we have historically competed primarily on the performance of our investment funds and other asset management products and services  and not on the level of our fees relative to those of our competitors 
however  there is a risk that fees in the asset management industry will decline  without regard to the historical performance of a manager  including our historical performance 
fee reductions on our existing or future investment funds and other asset management products and services  without corresponding decreases in our cost structure  would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
increases in capital commitments in our trading  underwriting and other businesses increase the potential for significant losses 
the trend in capital markets is toward larger and more frequent commitments of capital by financial services firms in many of their activities 
for example  in order to attract clients  investment banks are increasingly committing capital to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders  instead of the more traditional marketed underwriting process  in which marketing is typically completed before an investment bank commits capital to purchase securities for resale 
we have participated in this trend and expect to continue to do so 
as a result  we will be subject to increased risk as we commit greater amounts of capital to facilitate primarily client driven business 
furthermore  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we may enter into large transactions in which we commit our own capital as part of our trading business 
the number and size of these large transactions may materially affect our results of operations in a given period 
we may also incur significant losses from our trading activities due to market fluctuations and volatility from quarter to quarter 
we maintain trading positions in the fixed income and equity markets to facilitate client trading activities  and  at times  these positions can be large and concentrated in a single issuer 
in addition  our convertible debt trading group maintains proprietary trading positions 
to the extent that we own assets  ie  have long positions  a downturn in the value of those assets or in those markets could result in losses 
conversely  to the extent that we have sold assets we do not own  ie  have short positions  an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market 
we also commit capital to investment funds we sponsor and utilize our own funds as seed capital for new products and services in our asset management business 
these investments may diminish in value or may be lost entirely if market conditions are not favorable 
limitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our businesses 
liquidity  or ready access to funds  is essential to financial services firms 
failures of financial institutions have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity 
liquidity is of particular importance to our trading business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our clients and counterparties willingness to engage in brokerage transactions with us 
our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading clients  third parties or us 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 
our asset management business is also subject to liquidity risk due to investments in high risk  illiquid assets 
we have made substantial principal investments in our investment funds and may make additional investments in future funds  which often invest in securities that are not publicly traded 
there is a 
table of contents significant risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy 
in particular  these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made  changes in national or international economic conditions or changes in laws  regulations  fiscal policies or political conditions of countries in which investments are made 
it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of our investments through resale 
even if an investment proves to be profitable  it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash 
we have several broker dealer subsidiaries in several different jurisdictions which are each subject to the capital requirements of the relevant governmental and self regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions 
for example  thomas weisel partners llc  our largest broker dealer subsidiary  is subject to the net capital requirements of the sec and various self regulatory organizations of which it is a member 
these requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form 
any failure to comply with these net capital requirements could impair our ability to conduct our core business as a brokerage firm 
furthermore  thomas weisel partners llc and our other broker dealer subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from them to thomas weisel partners group  inc as a holding company  thomas weisel partners group  inc 
depends on distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund all payments on its obligations  including debt obligations 
as a result  regulatory actions could impede access to funds that thomas weisel partners group  inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk 
our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 
among other risks  we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure  breach of contract or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our customer positions and could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
also  risk management policies and procedures that we utilize with respect to investing our own funds or committing our capital with respect to investment banking  trading activities or asset management activities may not protect us or mitigate our risks from those activities 
if any of the variety of instruments  processes and strategies we utilize to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective  we may incur losses 
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets 
our financial  accounting or other data processing systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our offices 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  if we experience difficulties in conforming these systems to changes in law or regulation or changes in our business activities or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to 
table of contents our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
we also face the risk of operational failure of any of our clearing agents  the exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and to manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  our continuing integration of westwind will require operational and systems changes 
if the implementation of these changes results in operational failures or disruptions  it could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and impact our results of operations 
in addition  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption due to transitioning from one third party service provider to another or due to a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business  whether due to fire  other natural disaster  power or communications failure  act of terrorism or war or otherwise 
nearly all of our employees in our primary locations  including san francisco  new york  toronto  london and boston  work in close proximity to each other 
if a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations  our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to implement successfully contingency plans that depend on communication or travel 
insurance policies to mitigate these risks may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit 
further  any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain of these risks may not cover our loss 
our operations also rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
strategic investments or acquisitions and joint ventures may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
we intend to grow our business through both internal expansion and through strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures  we face numerous risks and uncertainties combining or integrating businesses  including integrating relationships with customers  business partners and internal data processing systems 
in the case of joint ventures  we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputational damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
in addition  conflicts or disagreements between us and our joint venture partners may negatively impact our businesses 
our recent acquisition of westwind and any future acquisitions or joint ventures could entail a number of risks  including problems with the effective integration of operations  the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  the inability to retain key employees  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  risks of misconduct by employees not subject to our control  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and exposure to new or unknown liabilities 

table of contents any future growth of our business may require significant resources and or result in significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
in addition  expansions  acquisitions or joint ventures may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
our international activities are subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country 
in  we expanded our international operations through the opening of our zurich  switzerland office  and we recently completed our acquisition of westwind partners  which resulted in our acquisition of operations and offices in canada and the expansion of our operations in london  england 
in connection with our business activities in canada  england  switzerland and india  and to the extent that we pursue other business opportunities outside the united states  we will be subject to political  economic  legal  operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in a foreign country  including risks of possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls  capital controls  exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions  as well as the outbreak of hostilities 
in many countries  the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market 
our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular foreign market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally 
we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions 
westwind s business is conducted and its revenues are substantially derived from activities outside of the united states 
accordingly  following our acquisition of westwind  our exposure to risks relating to international operations have increased significantly 
as we expand our international operations  we will increase our exposure to foreign currency risk 
as a result of the expanded international operations  we hold assets  incur liabilities  earn revenues and pay expenses in foreign currencies  including the canadian dollar  the swiss franc and the pound sterling 
because our financial statements will continue to be presented in us dollars  we will be required to translate assets  liabilities  income and expenses that relate to our international operations and that are denominated in foreign currencies into us dollars at the then applicable exchange rates 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus the various foreign currencies will affect the value of these items in our financial statements  even if their value has not changed in such foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be more volatile as a result of our international operations 
although we may enter into transactions to hedge portions of this foreign currency translation exposure  we will not be able to eliminate this exposure 
thomas weisel partners may experience difficulties  significant additional expenses  unexpected costs and delays as we continue to integrate our business  business model and culture with those of the former westwind capital corporation and the combined company may not realize synergies  efficiencies or cost savings 
prior to the completion of the acquisition of westwind  thomas weisel partners and westwind operated independently 
the success of the combined company following the completion of the transaction may depend in large part on the ability to integrate the two companies businesses  business models and cultures 
as we continue the integration of thomas weisel partners and westwind  we may experience difficulties  unanticipated costs and delays 
the challenges involved in the continued integration include the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations that employ a significant number of employees and addressing possible differences in corporate and regional cultures and management philosophies  
table of contents integrating and retaining personnel from different companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent  high quality client service  integrating information technology systems and resources  unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the transaction  performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management s attention to the transaction and subsequent integration  and meeting the expectations of clients with respect to the integration 
as we continue the integration  we expect to incur significant additional expenses in connection with the integration of the two businesses  including integrating personnel  geographically diverse operations  information technology systems  customers and strategic partners of each company 
we have made and expect to continue making changes to certain aspects of westwind s operations to integrate westwind s operations with those of thomas weisel partners 
for example  we have made changes to the way in which westwind s research professionals interact with its investment banking professionals to conform to thomas weisel partners policies and procedures in this regard 
in addition  we expect that westwind s combination with a larger firm could affect its existing client relationships or its ability to enter into new client relationships 
any changes that we have made or will make to westwind s operations  in addition to the fact that westwind is now part of a larger organization  could disrupt westwind s business and client relationships and could substantially affect our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the transaction and our business and results of operations 
the integration of certain operations  in particular regarding the two companies research and brokerage businesses  following the transaction will continue to take time and will require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from the routine business of the combined company 
the acquisition of westwind represented our first significant acquisition as a public company 
employee uncertainty and lack of focus as we continue the integration process may also disrupt the business of the combined company 
it is possible that the continuation of the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  diversion of the combined company s management s attention  the disruption or interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  the combined company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees  our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction  or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company 
in addition  the integration process may strain the combined company s financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures 
this may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the combined company s core business objectives 
even if thomas weisel partners and westwind are able to integrate such businesses and operations successfully  there can be no assurance that this integration will result in any synergies  efficiencies or cost savings or that any of these benefits will be achieved within a specific time frame 
evaluation of our prospects may be more difficult in light of our limited operating history 
our company was formed in and we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and prospects 
in addition we recently acquired westwind  which was formed in and which also has a limited operating history 
as a relatively young enterprise  we are subject to the risks and uncertainties that face a company during its formative development 
some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to attract and retain clients on a cost effective basis  expand and enhance our service offerings  raise additional capital and respond to competitive market conditions 
we may not be able to address these risks adequately  and our failure to do so may adversely affect our business and the value of an investment in our common stock 

table of contents we could be subject to unknown liabilities of westwind  which could cause us to incur substantial financial obligations and harm our business 
although the former westwind shareholders are required to indemnify us for certain breaches of representations and warranties made in the arrangement agreement governing our acquisition of westwind  the shareholders obligation is subject to monetary and time limitations 
in addition  if we are entitled to indemnification by the former westwind shareholders  it may be costly to enforce those rights and or we may not be successful in collecting amounts we are entitled to 
if there are liabilities of westwind of which we are not aware  we may have little or no recourse against the former westwind shareholders and may be obligated to bear the costs of those liabilities 
in addition  many of the former westwind shareholders will continue as employees of the combined company following closing of the transaction 
accordingly  if an indemnifiable claim does arise  we may need to weigh the need to be indemnified for that claim against the potential employee distraction or damage to employee relations that may result if we were to seek recourse for that claim 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we are subject to additional risks relating to westwind s business 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we are subject to the risks relating to westwind s business 
because the risks and uncertainties facing us may differ from those that faced westwind  the market price  results of operations and financial condition of the combined company may be affected by risks and uncertainties different from those affecting us prior to the acquisition 
these risks include the following westwind s focus on specific sectors of the economy westwind s investment banking business focused principally on the mining and energy sectors of the economy 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  the combined company s business has more exposure to these sectors than thomas weisel partners business had prior to the transaction 
volatility in the business environment in these sectors generally  including the related commodities markets  or in the market for securities of companies within these sectors  could substantially affect our business and results of operations 
westwind s focus on canada westwind generated a substantial majority of its revenues from canadian based clients 
as a result  westwind s business and results of operations was highly dependent on the strength of the canadian economy 
as a result of the acquisition of westwind  we expect that a significant portion of the combined company s business will be derived from canadian based clients 
accordingly  our business will be affected by changes in the canadian economy and investment activity in canada 
to the extent that we experience a decline in business in canada  due to unfavorable conditions in the canadian economy or otherwise  we may not be able to offset these declines by increases in other aspects of our business and our financial results could suffer 
risks related to our industry risks associated with regulatory impact on capital markets 
highly publicized financial scandals in recent years have led to investor concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets  and have prompted congress  the sec and finra to significantly expand corporate governance and public disclosure requirements 
to the extent that private companies  in order to avoid becoming subject to these new requirements  decide to forgo initial public offerings  our equity underwriting business may be adversely affected 
in addition  provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and the corporate governance rules imposed by self regulatory organizations have diverted many companies attention away from capital market transactions  including securities offerings and acquisition and disposition transactions 
in particular  companies that are or are planning to be public are incurring significant expenses in complying with the sec and accounting standards relating to internal control over financial reporting  and companies that disclose material weaknesses in such controls under the new 
table of contents standards may have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets 
these factors  in addition to adopted or proposed accounting and disclosure changes or changes in laws and regulations governing brokerage and research activities  may have an adverse effect on our business 
financial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years  increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
the us financial services industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators  including the sec  finra and state attorneys general 
penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years 
this regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate 
we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self regulatory organizations 
we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec  other united states or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets 
among other things  we could be fined  prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business prospects 
in addition  financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts 
the sec and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest 
we have adopted various policies  controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts and regularly seek to review and update our policies  controls and procedures 
however  appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult  and our reputation could be damaged if we fail  or appear to fail  to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest 
our policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs  additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk 
failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation 
for example  the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms 
several securities firms in the united states  including our wholly owned us broker dealer subsidiary  thomas weisel partners llc  reached a global settlement in and with certain federal and state securities regulators and self regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest 
under this settlement  the firms have been subject to certain restrictions and undertakings  which have imposed additional costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses 
potential civil lawsuits implicating investment research analysts conflicts of interest were not settled as part of the global settlement 
the global settlements also did not resolve potential charges involving individual employees  including supervisors  and regulatory investigations are continuing 
our total potential liability in respect of such civil cases cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material to our results of operations 
financial service companies have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries concerning market timing  late trading and other activities that focus on the mutual fund industry 
these inquiries have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds  investment advisers and broker dealers 
although we do not act as an investment adviser to mutual funds  the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our business  and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities 

table of contents our exposure to legal liability is significant  and damages that we may be required to pay and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us could materially adversely affect our businesses 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and  in recent years  the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have been increasing 
these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions  potential liability for fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
we are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
our role as advisor to our clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment  including rendering fairness opinions in connection with mergers and other transactions 
therefore  our activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liabilities to our clients and aggrieved third parties  including shareholders of our clients who could bring securities class actions against us 
our investment banking engagements typically include broad indemnities from our clients and provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services  but these provisions may not protect us or may not be enforceable in all cases 
for example  an indemnity from a client that subsequently is placed into bankruptcy is likely to be of little value to us in limiting our exposure to claims relating to that client 
as a result  we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business and prospects 
employee misconduct could harm us and is difficult to detect and deter 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur at our company 
for example  misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases  and we may suffer significant reputational harm for any misconduct by our employees 
risks related to ownership of our common stock taken together  a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock is owned or controlled by our senior professionals and other employees and their interests may differ from those of other shareholders 
our senior professionals and other employees collectively own more than of the total shares of common stock outstanding including shares exchangeable for common stock 
our chief executive officer  thomas w 
weisel  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock and our president and chief operating officer  lionel f 
conacher  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock including shares exchangeable for common stock 
mr 
weisel and mr 
conacher  together with the other members of our executive committee  collectively own approximately of our common stock including shares exchangeable for common stock 
as a result of these shareholdings  our senior professionals and employees are effectively able to elect our entire board of directors  control our management and policies  in general  determine without the consent of the other stockholders the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for 
table of contents approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
our employees are effectively able to prevent or cause a change in control of us 
these actions may be taken even if other shareholders oppose them 
provisions of our organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of us 
our organizational documents contain provisions that will impede the removal of directors and may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
for example  our board of directors may  without the consent of shareholders  issue preferred stock with greater voting rights than our common stock 
if a change of control or change in management that shareholders might otherwise consider to be favorable is prevented or delayed  the market price of our common stock could decline 
future sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and the trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our senior professionals  employees and other shareholders  or the possibility of such sales  may adversely affect the price of our common stock  may impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities  and may cause trading volume in our common stock to be volatile 
as of march   there are  shares of our common stock outstanding  including  exchangeable shares of twp acquisition company canada inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
each exchangeable share is exchangeable at any time into common stock of the registrant on a one for one basis  entitles the holder to dividend and other rights economically equivalent to those of the common stock  and through a voting trust  votes at our stockholder meetings 
of these shares  up to approximately million shares are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of subject to certain exceptions  the remaining approximately million shares of common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock will be available for future sale upon the expiration or the waiver of transfer restrictions or in accordance with registration rights 
in addition  since we became a public company we have granted and will continue to grant in the future equity awards to our employees that began to vest and become deliverable in upon vesting and delivery of the shares of common stock underlying these awards many employees may decide to sell all or a portion of their shares in the public markets and these sales may happen at or around the same time due to similar vesting dates or due to the limited periods of time trading windows when we allow our employees to trade our common stock 
these factors may affect both the price of our common stock and the volume of shares traded 
for further information refer to the securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans within item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form k 
the market price of our common stock may decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate widely  depending upon many factors  including our perceived prospects and those of the financial services industry in general  differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors  changes in general economic or market conditions  broad market fluctuations and failure to be covered by securities analysts 
declines in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees  including our senior professionals 
your interest in our firm may be diluted due to issuance of additional shares of common stock 
owners of our common stock may experience dilution of their equity investment as a result of our issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into  or exercisable for  shares of our common stock 
we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with any 
table of contents merger or acquisition we undertake  in future public or private offerings to raise additional capital or in satisfaction of currently outstanding restricted stock units  warrants and options 
for example  on january   we issued a total of  shares of our common stock and shares exchangeable for common stock to former shareholders of westwind in connection with our acquisition of westwind 
we also have granted and will continue to grant equity awards under our equity incentive plan as part of our compensation and hiring processes  and when these awards are vested or become deliverable we will issue additional shares of common stock in satisfaction thereof 
as of december   there were  restricted stock units outstanding 
of these restricted stock units   were made in connection with our initial public offering and have a three year vesting period 
the remaining  restricted stock units outstanding as of december  have a four year vesting period 
on february   we made an additional grant of  restricted stock units as part of our regular compensation process with a four year vesting period 
for further information refer to the securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans within item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form k 
we may be required to make substantial payments under indemnification agreements 
in connection with our initial public offering and our conversion to corporate form  we entered into agreements that provide for the indemnification of our members  partners  directors  officers and certain other persons authorized to act on our behalf against certain losses that may arise out of our initial public offering or the related reorganization transactions  certain liabilities of our partners relating to the time they were members of thomas weisel partners group llc  and certain tax liabilities of our former members that may arise in respect of periods prior to our initial public offering when we operated as a limited liability company 
in addition  in connection with acquisition transactions  such as our acquisition of westwind  and in connection with the ordinary conduct of our business  such as in our relationship with out clearing brokers  we have provided and will continue to provide indemnities to counterparties 
we may be required to make payments under these indemnification agreements  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain any future earnings to fund the operation and expansion of our business  and  therefore  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our shareholders must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on an investment in our common stock 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
we have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering of common stock in february and our follow on offering of common stock in may we have broad discretion to use the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering of common stock in february and our follow on offering of common stock in may  and our shareholders rely on the judgment of our board of directors and our management regarding the application of these proceeds 
through december   we have used a portion of the net proceeds of our common stock offerings to repay notes to third parties  to increase the capital in our broker dealer subsidiary  thomas weisel partners llc  to provide seed investment funds for new asset management products and for other general corporate purposes 
in january  we paid million in cash from these proceeds to former shareholders of westwind in connection with our acquisition of westwind 
the remaining portion of these net proceeds have been invested in municipal debt securities  auction rate securities and 
table of contents tax exempt money market funds 
we expect to use the remaining net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes  including support and expansion of our underwriting  trading and asset management businesses and strategic acquisitions and investments  but we have not allocated all of these net proceeds for specific purposes 
we may not be able to find appropriate opportunities to deploy these funds and any investments  whether for specific corporate purposes  such as investment in our underwriting  trading or asset management businesses  or for strategic acquisitions  may not generate favorable returns 
our common stock has only been publicly traded since february  and we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially 
there has only been a public market for our common stock since february  and since that date through march  our stock price on the nasdaq stock market has fluctuated between a low of per share and a high of per share 
the closing price of our common stock on march  on the nasdaq stock market was per share 
broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include  among others  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock  or our failure to meet the estimates made by securities analysts  announcements by us or our competitors or significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or divestitures  announcements by our competitors of their financial or operating results  to the extent those announcements are perceived by investors to be indicative of our future financial results or market conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  including sales of our common stock by our directors  officers and employees or by our other principal stockholders  and cyclical changes in the market in the growth sectors of the economy

overview we are an investment bank founded in focused principally on growth companies and growth investors 
our business is managed as a single operating segment and we generate revenues by providing financial services that include investment banking  brokerage  research and asset management 
we take a comprehensive approach in providing these services to growth companies 
during  we executed on the following initiatives acquisition of westwind 
in we initiated and on january  we completed our acquisition of westwind for approximately million 
westwind is a full service  institutionally oriented  independent investment bank focused on the energy and mining sectors 
westwind  which 
table of contents was founded in and headquartered in toronto  has additional offices in calgary  montreal and london 
westwind s mining and energy teams greatly expand our industry coverage 
in addition  with westwind s presence in toronto  calgary  montreal and london  our geographic coverage further extends into both canada and london through this acquisition 
integrating westwind is our primary focus in we expect to expand our trading in canadian securities as our energy and mining analysts begin to make a greater impact on our us and european accounts  and we will be hiring us based energy bankers and analysts to capitalize on westwind s capabilities in canada 
in europe  where we integrated our offices in early  we are combining our sales forces and marketing the combined companies products and expertise 
as the acquisition of westwind occurred on january   the consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and discussed below do not include westwind results 
expansion of brokerage business 
in we established offices in denver  cleveland and baltimore  and we hired two teams in europe of senior institutional sales professionals formerly associated with the prudential equity group 
in connection with the addition of these european based sales teams  we opened offices in london and zurich 
this expansion of our institutional sales department is an important step in our strategy to broaden our account base  as well as to expand our business in europe 
electronic trading 
in we began to market our electronic trading platform  as well as our commission sharing soft dollar program 
we expect these programs to increase our market share of the expanding volume of shares traded by institutional clients through alternative trading platforms 
investments in asset management platform 
during we provided an additional of million of seed investment capital to our small mid cap growth equity investment team based in portland  oregon 
we are currently facing difficult market and economic conditions 
due to the recent downturn in the market and possibility of recession within the us economy  client activity levels have decreased resulting in  among other things  lower overall investment banking activity 
it is difficult to predict when conditions will change 
consolidated results of operations our results of operations depend on a number of market factors  including market conditions and valuations for companies in the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors  as well as general securities market conditions 
trends in the securities markets are also affected by general economic trends  including fluctuations in interest rates  flows of funds into and out of the markets and other conditions 
in addition to these market factors  our revenues from period to period are substantially affected by the timing of investment banking transactions in which we are involved 
fees for many of the services we provide are earned only upon the completion of a transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations in any individual year or quarter may be affected significantly by whether and when significant transactions are completed 
notwithstanding this exposure to volatility and trends  in order to provide value to our clients  we have made a long term commitment to maintaining a substantial  full service integrated business platform 
as a result of this commitment  if business conditions result in decreases to our revenues  we may not experience corresponding decreases in the expense of operating our business

strategic advisory revenue decreased million in from our number of strategic advisory transactions and our average revenue per strategic advisory transaction were and million for both and strategic advisory revenues for included 
table of contents approximately million of revenues generated from multiple advisory services we performed for a single client 
our investment banking engagements usually relate to only one potential transaction and do not provide us with long term contracted sources of revenue 
as a result  our investment banking revenues have and likely will continue to vary significantly between periods 
in addition  our investment banking revenues are affected by the overall level of capital raising and mergers and acquisitions activity in the marketplace 
based on data from dealogic  privateraise  bloomberg  securities data corp 
and other data sources  us equity capital markets transactions including ipos  secondary offerings  convertible debt securities offerings  registered direct offerings and private placements and mergers and acquisitions activity is estimated as follows for the years ended december  transactions in our target sectors a transactions in all market sectors our target sectors as a percentage of total transactions revenue generated in our target sectors a in billions revenue generated in all markets in billions our target sectors as a percentage of total value a for the years ended december  and  target sectors refers to the technology  healthcare and consumer sectors of the economy 
based upon the market information presented above  for  within our target sectors the number of transactions decreased while the revenue increased from this compares to our number of transactions which decreased and our revenue which increased in compared to brokerage revenues our brokerage revenues include i commissions paid by customers from brokerage transactions in equity securities  ii spreads paid by customers on convertible debt securities  iii trading gains and losses which result from market making activities  from our commitment of capital to facilitate customer transactions and from proprietary trading activities relating to our convertible debt and special situations trading groups  iv advisory fees paid to us by high net worth individuals and institutional clients of our private client services group  which are generally based on the value of the assets we manage and v fees paid to us for research 
the concentration in brokerage revenues among our ten largest brokerage clients was  and in  and  respectively  which represents approximately million  million and million of brokerage revenues  respectively 
versus brokerage revenue decreased million in from the decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in trading volumes in our institutional equity business  partially offset by improvements in our convertible bonds and private client services businesses 
the combined average daily volume on the new york stock exchange and nasdaq was approximately billion shares in  an increase of from our combined average daily customer trading volume decreased in from primarily due to declines in the volume of shares we traded for our institutional brokerage customers 
we believe the decline in our trading volume for institutional customers is partially due to the increased use of alternative trading systems by our customers  a decrease in the willingness of our traditional brokerage customers to pay full service commissions in order to access our equity research and other factors 

table of contents in response to these factors  we have taken several steps  including i increasing our focus on middle markets customers  who account for an increasing amount of trading commissions with the brokerage industry and who  in many cases  are engaging in investing activities that utilize our equity research  ii developing our product offerings within electronic trading in order to attract and retain trading volume from customers who are shifting away from utilizing full service brokerage services and increasing their use of alternative trading systems and iii broadening our geographic coverage 
versus brokerage revenue decreased million in from the decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenue from our institutional business due to a reduction in our average daily volume of shares traded for our customers as well  as a decline in our average commissions per share 
this overall decrease in brokerage revenue was partially offset by an increase in research fees and our private client services business 
the combined average daily volume on the new york stock exchange and nasdaq was approximately billion shares in  an increase of from our combined average daily customer trading volume decreased in from primarily due to declines in the volume of shares we traded for our institutional brokerage customers 
in march  we entered into an arrangement with fidelity management research company  one of our largest institutional brokerage clients in terms of commission revenue  under which fidelity will separate payments for research products or services from trading commissions for brokerage services and will pay for research directly in cash  instead of compensating us through trading commissions as under soft dollar practices 
since entering into this agreement  our brokerage revenues from fidelity have materially decreased as compared to those we received in asset management revenue our asset management revenues include i fees from investment partnerships we manage  ii allocation of the appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of our investments in the underlying partnerships  iii fees we earn from the management of equity distributions received by our clients and iv other asset management related realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments not associated with investment partnerships  which investments are primarily equity securities 
the following table sets forth our asset management revenues dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change change asset management revenue management fees private equity realized and unrealized gains and losses net other securities total revenues versus asset management revenue increased million in from the increase was primarily due to increased investment gains in partnerships of million due to gains from several of our investment funds  as well as increased management fees of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in investment gains in other securities in compared to management fees increased million in from this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in fees received from thomas weisel global growth partners twggp and thomas weisel healthcare venture partners twhvp of million and million  respectively 
these increases were the result of certain management fees being waived in that were not waived in in addition  in  the thomas weisel india opportunity fund was created which resulted in management fees of million 

table of contents investment gains in partnerships increased million in from this increase was primarily due to an increase in investment gains from thomas weisel venture partners  twhvp and twggp of million  million and million  respectively 
these increases in investment gains in partnerships were partially offset by a decrease in investment gains in partnerships of million from thomas weisel capital partners twcp 
versus asset management revenue decreased by million in from the decrease was primarily due to the fact that in we no longer received management fees from twcp  which were million in twcp is a late stage private equity fund whose management was transferred to a third party in the fourth quarter of although we no longer receive management fees from twcp  we have retained our capital account in twcp and will receive gain and loss allocations in respect of our capital account balance 
management fees decreased million in from as discussed above  the decrease is primarily attributable to the transfer of management of twcp from which we received million in management fees in investment gains in partnerships increased million in from  primarily due to an increase in investment gains received from twcp and twhvp of million and million  respectively 
the increase in investment gains from partnerships was offset by a decrease in investment gains in other securities of million in compared to other revenue versus other revenue of million recorded in relates to the gain  net of selling costs  on the sale of certain software previously developed for internal use 
at the time of sale there were no amounts capitalized relating to this software 
expenses excluding interest the following table sets forth information relating to our expenses excluding interest  both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of net revenues dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  change change expenses excluding interest compensation and benefits non compensation expenses total expenses excluding interest percentage of net revenues compensation and benefits non compensation expenses total average number of employees compensation and benefits expense compensation and benefits expenses to secure the services of our employees have been the largest component of our total expenses 
compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  overtime  bonuses  commissions  share based compensation  benefits  severance  employment taxes and other employee costs 

table of contents we have a discretionary bonus plan based on a combination of firm and individual performance and we have entered into guaranteed contractual agreements with employees that require specified bonus payments  both of which are accrued over the service periods 
these bonuses make up a significant portion of our compensation and benefits expense  particularly for our senior professionals 
in connection with the integration of westwind  we have more closely aligned the compensation practices of the two firms with one another and with industry practice by discontinuing the payment of retention bonuses 
we accelerated the payment of our retention bonuses  which were historically established at year end and paid in the following july  so that they became part of the year end bonuses  which were paid in february the company recorded a one time compensation expense of million in the fourth quarter of related to this change in compensation practice  as well as a one time expense of million related to certain acquisition related severance payments 
share based awards constitute a portion of our compensation expense  vest over a four year service period except for the share based awards issued in connection with our initial public offering  which vest over a three year period  are subject to continued employment and  accordingly  are recorded as non cash compensation expense ratably over the service period beginning at the date of grant 
as a result  our aggregate compensation expense has been  and will continue to be  impacted as we recognize multiple years of share based compensation expense associated with the vesting of prior year grants in and subsequent years 
as of december   there was i million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made in connection with our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and ii an additional million of unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock unit awards made subsequent to our initial public offering  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  in february we granted share based awards of million  net of expected forfeitures  which will be recognized in compensation expense over the four year vesting period beginning in february and ending in january in connection with our initial public offering  we announced that we intended to target aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering within the range of to of annual net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities 
in  we were not able to comply with this policy due to the one time compensation expense we incurred in the fourth quarter of related to the acceleration of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses 
competitive pressures may require that we incur compensation and benefits expense in order to retain our professionals and recruit additional professionals regardless of the level of our net revenues 
further  new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before realizing associated additional revenues 
as a result in  we will not establish a target ratio of aggregate annual compensation and benefits expense to net revenues  although we will continue to evaluate thoroughly business and personnel decisions with respect to their impact on compensation and benefits expense 
versus compensation and benefits expense increased million in from the increase primarily relates to the one time compensation expense of million in the fourth quarter of attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses  each of which were related to the integration of westwind 
in addition  the average number of employees increased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  which has increased the salary related expenses during compensation and benefits expense in and included million and million  respectively  of non cash compensation expense relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering 
compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering and excluding the one time compensation expense in the

compensation and benefits expense excluding expenses relating to share based awards made in connection with our initial public offering  as a percentage of net revenues excluding investment gains and losses attributable to investments in partnerships and other securities decreased to in from in non compensation expenses our non compensation expenses include brokerage execution  clearance and account administration  communications and data processing  depreciation and amortization  marketing and promotion  occupancy and equipment and other expenses 
versus non compensation expenses increased million in from the overall increase in non compensation expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotion expense  other expenses and communication expense of million  million and million  respectively 
marketing and promotion expense increased primarily due to increased travel and entertainment related to the geographic expansion of our business 
other expense increased as a result of expenses related to a third party private equity management agreement which began in late and communications expenses increased due to our opening additional offices during the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in brokerage  execution  clearance and account administration expense due to improved efficiencies in our trade execution practices and lower nyse exchange rate fees  as well as less clearance charges associated with lower trading volume 
versus non compensation expenses decreased million in from the overall decrease in non compensation expenses was primarily due to brokerage execution  clearance and account administration expense decreasing million due to lower share volume and decreased execution expenses as a result of our conversion to a new primary clearing broker 
in addition  communications and data processing expense decreased million as a result of lower data communications and it equipment expenses  offset slightly by costs incurred in connection with converting our trading systems to a new primary clearing broker in may we received insurance recoveries during both and  however  such recoveries received were greater in as compared to amounts received in  which resulted in a decrease to other expense in this overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in occupancy and equipment expense primarily due to our decision to sublease  at a lower rate than our current lease rate  certain premises in san francisco  menlo park and boston 
finally  other expense increased million due to increased professional services associated with operating as a public company  which included audit related fees and sarbanes oxley consulting fees 

table of contents provision for taxes before completion of our initial public offering on february   we were a limited liability company and all of our income and losses were reportable by our individual members  and  accordingly  the us federal and state income taxes payable by our members  based upon their share of our net income  had not been reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our initial public offering  we reorganized from a limited liability company into a corporation  and following that reorganization became subject to us federal and state income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the three months ended march   we recognized a one time tax benefit upon conversion to a corporation in connection with the establishment of our deferred tax asset balances  partially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management at that time  concluded that a portion of the deferred tax benefit  which resulted from unrealized capital losses  more likely than not would not be realized due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate future capital gains to offset such capital losses 
based on the performance of the underlying investments in our investments in partnerships during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by million 
as of december   the deferred tax asset recorded to reflect these net unrealized losses was million  and the related valuation allowance was million 
in  based upon the performance of the underlying investments in our investments in partnerships and our expectation as to the future performance of such investments  we reduced the valuation allowance from million to zero and recognized a deferred tax benefit of million on the increase in net unrealized losses 
this resulted in a deferred tax asset balance at december  of million 
as a result we recognized deferred tax benefits during resulting in a reduction in the effective tax rate for our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in from is primarily due to the one time tax benefit in  discussed above 
business combination on january   we announced the completion of our acquisition of westwind 
under the agreement  we indirectly acquired all of westwind s outstanding shares and westwind became our indirect subsidiary 
the purchase price was approximately million  which consisted of million in cash   shares of our common stock valued at per share based on the average closing price over a five day period starting two days prior to the acquisition announcement date of october  and ending two days after the announcement date and direct acquisition costs of million consisting primarily of legal  accounting and advisory fees 
direct acquisition costs are included in other assets on our statements of financial condition 
common stock includes exchangeable shares  which are shares of our wholly owned canadian subsidiary that are exchangeable for shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in february  we historically satisfied our capital and liquidity requirements through capital raised from our partners and strategic investors  internally generated cash from operations and available credit from market sources 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  raising million in net proceeds  and  in may  we completed a follow on public offering of common stock  raising million in net proceeds 
we believe that our current level of equity capital  which includes the net proceeds from our initial public offering and our follow on offering of common stock  funds anticipated to be provided by 
table of contents operating activities and funds available under temporary loan agreements  will be adequate to meet our liquidity and regulatory capital requirements for the next months 
the following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and other investments balances as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents other investments total other investments includes million in auction rate securities ars  which are variable rate debt instruments  having long term maturity dates approximately to years  but whose interest rates are reset through an auction process  most commonly at intervals of  and days 
all of our auction rate securities are backed by pools of student loans and all were rated aaa aaa as of december  our intent with respect to these investments is not to hold these securities to maturity  but rather to use the periodic auction feature to provide liquidity 
in january we sold a substantial portion of our auction rate securities holdings through the normal auction process and used the proceeds to fund our acquisition of westwind 
the net proceeds from these sales were million  resulting in a balance of million at january  in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for our remaining million of ars 
we continue to receive interest when due on our ars at a weighted average interest rate that is currently and expect to continue to receive interest when due in the future 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions occur  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the issuers and the underwriters establish a different form of financing to replace these securities  or final payments come due according to contractual maturities ranging from to years 
while the recent auction failures will limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
debt financing in connection with our initial public offering of common stock  we issued million of unsecured senior notes to our former class d and class d shareholders and are required to make principal and interest payments on these notes in accordance with their terms 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under these notes was million and is due in we also have a secured financing arrangement with general electric capital corporation that is secured by furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements  with a year term and a variable interest rate at libor plus 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million and is due in bonus and share based compensation the timing of bonus and retention compensation payments to our employees may significantly affect our cash position and liquidity from period to period 
while our employees are generally paid salaries semi monthly during the year  bonus payments  which make up a larger portion of total compensation  have historically been paid in february and july 
in february  we made aggregate cash bonus payments to our employees of approximately million and  in addition  granted equity awards with a grant date fair value of million 
in addition  in february we made aggregate cash payments of million to our employees attributable to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses  which had historically been paid in july  and certain severance expenses  each of which were related to the integration of westwind 
on february    shares of freely transferable common stock became deliverable to our employees in respect of share based awards granted on february  we elected to settle a portion 
table of contents of these vesting shares through a net settlement feature provided for in sfas no 
r  share based payment  to meet the minimum statutory income tax withholding requirements of our employees 
we made a payment of million related to the net settlement of shares that vested on february  our cash position and liquidity will be affected to the extent we elect to continue to settle a portion of vesting shares through net settlement in the future 
regulatory net capital and other amounts required to be maintained at broker dealer subsidiary thomas weisel partners llc  our wholly owned subsidiary and a registered securities broker dealer  is subject to the net capital requirements of the nyse and the sec s uniform net capital rule 
nyse and sec regulations also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met 
at december   and thomas weisel partners llc had excess net capital of million  million  and million  respectively 
thomas weisel partner llc s excess net capital decreased from december  to december  primarily due to an increase in a receivable from thomas weisel partners group relating to operating expenses incurred by thomas weisel partner llc on behalf of thomas weisel partners group 
thomas weisel partners group repaid million of the receivable to thomas weisel partners llc in january regulatory net capital requirements change based on certain investment and underwriting activities 
our primary clearing broker is also the primary source of the short term financing of our securities inventory 
in connection with the provision of the short term financing  thomas weisel partners llc is required to maintain deposits with our clearing broker 
these deposits are included in our net receivable from or payable to clearing brokers 
during the year ended december   increases in our securities inventory resulted in an increase of million in the deposits we were required to maintain 
due to the nature of our investment banking and brokerage businesses  liquidity is of critical importance to us 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions 
from time to time we may borrow funds under temporary subordinated loan agreements with our primary clearing broker 
such funds would constitute capital for purposes of calculating our net capital position 
acquisition of westwind on january   we completed our acquisition of westwind 
at the closing of this transaction we made a cash payment of million as the cash portion of the consideration for this acquisition 
in addition  we expect to make cash payments of approximately million for acquisition related costs 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have or are reasonably likely to have an effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition  operations or cash flows 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at december  operating activities provided million of cash in our net income less non cash items used million of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  non cash items included in our net income of  were gains from partnership and other securities of million and a deferred tax benefit of million  offset partially by share based compensation expenses and depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the net effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities provided million of cash during accrued compensation increased million 
table of contents due to the acceleration of the payment of mid year retention bonuses and certain severance expenses related to the integration of westwind 
these expenses were accrued as of december   however  as discussed above  were paid to our employees in february offsetting the increase in our accrued compensation was the tax benefit of million  which was recorded as an income tax receivable  resulting in a decrease of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we capitalized million of costs associated with the acquisition of westwind resulting in a decrease of cash and cash equivalents during finally  our net securities owned increased from december  to december  by million which decreased cash and cash equivalents 
this was offset by distributions received from investment partnerships of million 
investing activities provided million of cash in  which is the result of receiving proceeds from the sale of other investments of million 
this cash increase is offset by the purchase of million of municipal and auction rate securities  purchases of investments in private equity partnerships of million and property and equipment of million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
fair value of financial instruments securities owned  securities sold  but not yet purchased and other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the use of fair value to measure these financial instruments  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
fair values of our financial instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer price quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
financial instruments we own long positions are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold  but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
if liquidating a position is reasonably expected to affect its prevailing market price  our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
investments in partnerships and other securities investments in partnerships include our general and limited partnership interests in investment partnerships and direct investments in non public equity securities 
these interests are carried at estimated fair value 
the net assets of investment partnerships consist primarily of investments in non marketable securities 
the underlying investments held by such partnerships are valued based on estimated fair value ultimately determined by us or our affiliates in our capacity as general partner and  in the case of an investment in an unaffiliated investment partnership  are based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner 
due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation  fair values of these non marketable investments may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for these investments  and the differences could be material 
increases and decreases in estimated fair value are recorded based on underlying information of these non public company investments including third party transactions evidencing a change in value  market comparables  operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies  trends within sectors and or regions  
table of contents underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
in cases where an estimate of fair value is determined based on financial statements prepared by an unaffiliated general partner  such financial statements are generally unaudited other than audited year end financial statements 
upon receipt of audited financial statements from an investment partnership  we adjust the fair value of the investments in our subsequent financial statements to reflect the audited partnership results if they differ from initial estimates 
the investment partnerships in which we are a general partner may allocate carried interest and make carried interest distributions to the general partner if the partnerships investment performance reaches a threshold as defined in the respective partnership agreements 
we recognize the allocated carried interest when this threshold is met  however future investment underperformance may require amounts previously distributed to us to be returned to the partnership 
we earn fees from the investment partnerships which we manage or of which we are a general partner 
such management fees are generally based on the net assets or committed capital of the underlying partnerships 
through march   we agreed in certain cases to waive management fees  in lieu of making a cash contribution  in satisfaction of our general partner investment commitments to the investment partnerships 
in these cases  we generally recognize our management fee revenues at the time when we are allocated a special profit interest in realized gains from these partnerships 
with respect to the investment partnerships existing as of march   we will no longer waive management fees subsequent to march  liability for lease losses our accrued expenses and other liabilities include a liability for lease losses related to office space that we subleased due to staff reductions in prior years 
the liability for lease losses was million at december  and will expire with the termination of the relevant facility leases through we estimate our liability for lease losses as the net present value of the differences between lease payments and receipts under sublease agreements 
legal and other contingent liabilities we are involved in various pending and potential complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and proceedings related to our business 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
the number of complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions like us has been increasing in recent years 
we have  after consultation with counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to the extent we have determined a claim will result in a probable loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management and our ultimate liabilities may be materially different 
in making these determinations  management considers many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of successful defense against the claim and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential complaints  arbitrations  legal actions  investigations and proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
see note commitments  guarantees and contingencies for a further description of legal proceedings 
if a potential adverse contingency should become probable or be resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves during any period  our results of operations in that period and  in some cases  succeeding periods could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our receivables include corporate finance and syndicate receivables relating to our advisory and investment banking engagements 
we also have receivables from our clearing brokers in connection with the clearing of our brokerage transactions 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on the number of days past due and on a specific identification basis 
management is continually evaluating our receivables for collectibility and possible write off by examining the facts and circumstances surrounding each specific case where a loss is deemed a possibility 
deferred tax valuation allowance as a corporation  we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
for our investments in partnerships  adjustments to the carrying value are made based on determinations of the fair value of underlying investments held by such partnerships 
both upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of investment partnerships  which are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations  represent timing differences until such time as these gains and losses are realized 
during  we had net unrealized capital losses on these investment partnerships 
due to our determination in february of the uncertainty of our ability to generate future realized capital gains to offset capital losses  in february we recorded a valuation allowance of million for the deferred tax asset attributable to net unrealized losses in our investment partnerships 
based on the performance of the underlying investments in our investments in partnerships during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by million 
as of december   the deferred tax asset recorded to reflect these net unrealized losses was million  and the related valuation allowance was million 
in  based upon the performance of the underlying investments in our investments in partnerships and our expectation as to the future performance of such investments  we reduced the valuation allowance from million to zero and recognized a deferred tax benefit of million on the increase in net unrealized losses 
this resulted in a deferred tax asset balance at december  of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financing activities directly expose us to various types of risks  including i market risk relating to  among other things  the changes in the market value of equity or debt instruments and ii interest rate risk relating to the effect of changes in interest rates and the yield curve on the value of debt instruments that we hold and our payment obligations in respect of notes that we have issued 
we are also exposed to other risks in the conduct of our business such as credit risk and the effects of inflation 
our exposure to these risks could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
set forth below is a discussion of some of these risks together with quantitative information regarding the aggregate amount and value of financial instruments that we hold or in which we maintain a position or that we have issued and that remain outstanding  in each case  as of december  and due to the nature of our business  in particular our trading business  the amount or value of financial instruments that we hold or maintain a position in will fluctuate on a daily and intra day basis and the year end values and amounts presented below are not necessarily indicative of the exposures to market risk  interest rate risk and other risks we may experience at various times throughout any given year 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
market risk may be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary in customer trading and to our market making and investment activities  which activities include committing from time to time to purchase large blocks of stock from publicly traded issuers or their significant shareholders 
we trade in equity and convertible debt securities as an active participant in both listed and otc equity and convertible debt markets and typically maintain securities in inventory to facilitate our market making activities and customer order flow 
market risk is inherent in financial instruments

in connection with our asset management activities  we provide seed investment funds for new asset management products to be invested in long and short positions in publicly traded equities and related options and other derivative instruments 
these seed investments are included in the tables presented above 

table of contents in addition to the positions set forth in the table above  we maintain investments in venture capital and other investment funds we manage or have managed 
these investments are carried at fair value in accordance with industry guidance and as of december  and the carrying amount of these investments was million and million  respectively 
from time to time we may use a variety of risk management techniques and hedging strategies in the ordinary course of our brokerage activities  including establishing position limits by product type and industry sector  closely monitoring inventory turnover  maintaining long and short positions in related securities and using exchange traded equity options and other derivative instruments 
in connection with our brokerage activities  management reviews reports appropriate to the risk profile of specific trading activities 
typically  market conditions are evaluated and transaction details and securities positions are reviewed 
these activities seek to ensure that trading strategies are within acceptable risk tolerance parameters  particularly when we commit our own capital to facilitate client trading 
our accounting department is actively involved in ensuring the integrity and clarity of the daily profit and loss statements  to the extent that we maintain trading positions for a period longer than one day 
activities include price verification procedures  position reconciliation and review of transaction booking 
we believe that these procedures  which stress timely communications between our traders  institutional brokerage management and senior management  are important elements in evaluating and addressing market risk 
as described in note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  credit risk or market risk to our consolidated financial statements  we were a party to an employment agreement the value of which was indexed to publicly traded shares of an unrelated entity 
this agreement was considered a derivative under applicable gaap and  accordingly  was marked to market through compensation and benefits expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   the liability related to this employment agreement was paid to the employee 
the fair value of this derivative liability was zero and million at december  and december   respectively  and is not reflected in the december  table above 
we also reduced our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the employment agreement by purchasing shares of the underlying security  which are included under other investments in the december  table above 
in accordance with our stated accounting policy  these shares were carried at market value with fluctuations in value reflected in asset management revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities and other fixed income securities  as well as convertible debt securities  and incur interest sensitive liabilities from time to time  we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
certain of these interest rate risks may be managed through the use of short positions in us government and corporate debt securities and other instruments 
in addition  we issued floating rate notes to california public employees retirement system and nomura america investment  inc in connection with our reorganization on february  and are  therefore  exposed to the risk of higher interest payments on those notes if interest rates rise

table of contents credit risk our broker dealer subsidiaries place and execute customer orders 
the orders are then settled by unrelated clearing organizations that maintain custody of customers securities and provide financing to customers 
the majority of our transactions  and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure  is with our clearing brokers 
the clearing brokers are also the primary source of our short term financing securities sold  but not yet purchased  which is collateralized by cash and securities owned by us and held by the clearing brokers 
our securities owned may be pledged by the clearing brokers 
the amount receivable from payable to the clearing brokers represents amounts receivable payable in connection with the proprietary and customer trading activities 
as of december  and  our cash on deposit with the clearing brokers of million and million  respectively  was not collateralizing any liabilities to the clearing brokers 
in addition to the clearing brokers  we are exposed to credit risk from other brokers  dealers and other financial institutions with which we transact business 
through indemnification provisions in our agreement with our clearing organizations  customer activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk 
we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in the event a customer fails to settle a trade on its original terms or in the event cash and securities in customer margin accounts are not sufficient to fully cover customer obligations 
we seek to control the risks associated with brokerage services for our customers through customer screening and selection procedures as well as through requirements that customers maintain margin collateral in compliance with governmental and self regulatory organization regulations and clearing organization policies 
effects of inflation because our assets are generally liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
