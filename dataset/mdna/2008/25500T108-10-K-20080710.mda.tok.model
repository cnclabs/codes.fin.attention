item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding these statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a risk factors for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in enhancing voice quality and canceling echo in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide security in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our more recent product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced voice quality assurance vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the macroeconomic environment of us wireline and  more recently  wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
since the beginning of calendar year  large north american telecommunications service providers have been engaged in merger and acquisition activity 
this activity largely drove a decline in our fiscal revenue as one of our two largest fiscal us customers was and continues to be involved in post merger integration and  consequently  orders from that customer since the first quarter of fiscal have been nominal 
over the last few quarters  we have experienced delays in purchasing decisions relative to voice quality equipment by our domestic and international carriers due to the interplay of budget constraints with the strategic nature of their voice quality deployment and their transition to third generation cellular technology g networks 
our revenue will continue to be generated primarily from sales of our bvp flex  which accounted for of our revenue in fiscal in an attempt to diversify our customer base  we have added sales and marketing resources over the last few years to focus on new large account opportunities in the united states and internationally 
in the united states  we believe that our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks will be key factors in adding new customers and driving opportunities for revenue growth 
the development of our vqa feature set was originally targeted at the international global system for mobile communications gsm market but has seen growing importance in the domestic market as well 
we continue to focus sales and marketing efforts on international and domestic mobile carriers who might best apply our vqa solution 
we have added sales resources and invested in customer trials domestically and internationally in an attempt to better avail ourselves of these opportunities as they arise 
despite these efforts we have experienced mixed results as we remain dependant on the buying patterns of a small  yet more diverse  group of large customers 
in fiscal  orascom telecom holding orascom became our largest vqa customer to date  as well as a step toward our goal of greater customer diversification 
although our international business accounted for million of revenue in fiscal  largely attributable to orascom  revenue from international customers in fiscal was only million  due to delays in closing international transactions 
we expect additional long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing trend of service providers transitioning from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
as such  since the beginning of fiscal we have directed  and expect to continue to direct  the majority of our r d spending towards the development of our packet voice processor  a platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities combined with our vqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss  delay and jitter 
to further develop a presence in the voip market and future wireless carrier networks  we acquired jasomi in the first quarter of fiscal jasomi s currently available peerpoint c session border controller enables voip calls over smaller carrier networks to traverse the network address translation nat and protects networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
to date  we have recognized modest revenue from peerpoint 
although fiscal marked the first period in which revenue from the packet voice processor exceeded of total revenue  ordering patterns are still volatile leading to spikes in the timing and amount of revenue 
exit of optical business 
in may  we announced a change to our strategic direction 
we decided to focus all of our assets in continuing to grow our voice processing business  including our echo cancellation and vqa products  and as a result we decided to sell our optical communications business 
in july  we completed the primary step in our planned exit of our optical communications business through the sale of a large portion of the assets of the optical communications business to jds uniphase corporation jdsu 
the assets sold consisted primarily of inventory  certain specified optical related equipment and intellectual property rights  which were sold for an aggregate purchase price of up to approximately million in cash  of which up to million was to be paid to us based on the level of inventory consumed by jdsu  and revenues generated by the optical business acquired by jdsu through june   if any 
jdsu also had indemnification rights in connection with the performance of certain warranty obligations relating to optical products that were sold by us on or prior to july  in june  we and jdsu came to a mutual settlement and release whereby jdsu paid us million and released us from our warranty obligation 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have sold or abandoned all of the assets not purchased by jdsu during fiscal as a result of exiting the optical business  our consolidated statements of operations reflect the optical business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition history 
in the last five fiscal years  we have completed one acquisition 
in june  we acquired jasomi  which developed and sold session border controllers that enable voip calls to traverse the nat and protect networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
the integration of our packet voice processor and jasomi s session border control technology may enable ditech to provide a more comprehensive solution to carriers border service needs 
consideration for the acquisition included million in cash  escrow payments  vested options assumed  acquisition costs  and net liabilities assumed plus million in non transferable convertible notes 
the payment of the full million principal amount of the convertible notes was contingent on the retention of a specified number of designated employees and was broken into two tranches 
the conditions of the first tranche were met in june at which point million was paid and reflected as an adjustment to the purchase price 
the second tranche of million was paid in july  after the conditions related to that tranche were met 
we additionally issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees hired as part of the acquisition 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our customer base 
historically  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
we expect that as we expand shipments of our newer voice processing products  which are targeted at gsm networks  international revenue will begin to become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal our five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced in fiscal as revenue was approximately of our fiscal revenue primarily due to a lack of orders from one of our two largest fiscal customers 
this caused fiscal to result in a net loss 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
to the extent there are material differences between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of customers 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the united states and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
to the extent that we have received cash for some or all of a given deferred revenue transaction  we reported it in the consolidated balance sheet as a deferred revenue liability 
however  to the extent that we have not collected cash related to the deferred revenue transaction  we reflect the deferred revenue as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   million related to deferrals associated primarily with installations and other product related deferrals and million was associated with maintenance contracts 
in dealing with smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments we consider investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year  and auction rate securities  which we have historically settled on  or day auction cycles  as short term investments 
however  when auction rate securities fail to settle at auction  which occurred in fiscal  and conditions leading to their failure to auction create uncertainty as to whether they will settle in the near term  we classify them as long term consistent with the contractual term of the underlying security 
long term investment securities include any investments with remaining maturities of one year or more and auction rate securities for which we are unable to estimate when they will settle 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of corporate notes and asset backed securities 
we have classified our investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we carry available for sale securities at fair value  and report unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income  net based on specific identification 
we include interest on securities classified as available for sale in total other income 
see also the discussion in liquidity and capital resources and item a for additional information on auction rate securities 
inventory valuation in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we constantly monitor projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of write downs required for inventory on hand and inventory on order from our contract manufacturers 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying write downs in a timely manner  sudden changes in buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels has resulted in the recognition of larger than anticipated write downs 
for example  we recorded an inventory write down for excess levels of inventory of million in fiscal there were no sales of previously written down inventory in fiscal we sold million and million of other previously written down inventory in fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal and sales of previously written down inventory had a negligible impact on gross margin  as we sold the inventory for approximately its net book value 
cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer warranties on the hardware elements of our products ranging from one to five years and warranties on the software elements of our products ranging from days to one year 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures 
this would result in a decrease in gross profit 
as of april   we had recorded million of accruals related to estimated future warranty costs 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill our methodology for allocating a portion of the purchase price to goodwill in connection with the purchase of jasomi was determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology communications equipment industry 
goodwill was measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
during the first quarter of fiscal  goodwill increased million from million recorded at april  as we recorded the payment of the non employee investor portion of the million second and final tranche of convertible notes plus accrued interest 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  or more frequently if conditions warrant it 
impairment of long lived assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances arise  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carry amount of the assets in question  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
following the criteria of sfas disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  we view ourselves as having a single operating segment and reporting unit and consequently have evaluated goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of our fair value as a whole 
our quoted share price from nasdaq is the basis for measurement of that fair value  as our market capitalization based on share price best represents the amount at which we could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
since the first quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a decline in our stock price and therefore our market capitalization  due in large part to the recent decline in our operating results 
as a result of our stock price s continued depressed state and uncertainty as to when our stock price would return to levels sufficient to justify the recovery of our recorded goodwill  we undertook an interim impairment review in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the review  we determined that the entire goodwill balance of million was in fact impaired and therefore recorded an impairment loss as part of our third quarter fiscal results 
we evaluate the recoverability of our amortizable purchased intangible assets based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset group represents the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in addition to the interim review for goodwill impairment discussed above  we also performed impairment reviews of our purchased intangibles and other long lived assets as of january   which review did not indicate any impairment of these assets 
due to events that transpired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  including but not limited to a competitor s introduction of a new competitive product that appears to have created a sudden shift in demand away from the legacy jasomi products  we determined that an impairment had occurred and accordingly recorded a million impairment loss in fiscal accounting for stock based compensation effective may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior period results in our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for all stock based payments granted after may  and prior to but not vested as of may  under sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period 
given our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and  because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although we determine the fair value of employee stock options in accordance with sfas r and sab using the black scholes option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller in a market transaction 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected option life and volatility of our stock price 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or the estimated forfeiture rate changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes amounts recorded for income taxes  both current and deferred  are based on estimates of the tax consequences of our operations in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
as part of our ongoing assessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  on a quarterly basis we review the expiration dates of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we complete a study on the impact of section of the internal revenue code on at least a semi annual basis to determine whether a change in ownership may limit the value of our net operating loss carryforwards 
we determined that a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets at april  was required 
we have considered all evidence  positive and negative  pursuant to sfas  accounting for income taxes and believe that based on our recent operating losses and uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of future operating profits  it is no longer more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
effective may   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we have classified interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of fin effective may   we recognized a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a decrease in the may  balance of accumulated deficit 
we do not expect a significant change to the liability over the next months 
in general  our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes  tax impact of foreign operations  and changes in the state tax rate as it relates to certain deferred tax assets specifically for california purposes only 
however in fiscal  the effective tax rate was also significantly impacted by the impairment losses recorded against goodwill and other purchased intangibles and from the establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset position 
the state tax rate changed with respect to this deferred tax asset as a result of our filing tax returns in additional other states 
the effective tax rate was  and for fiscal   and  respectively 
we have completed the two year audit of our federal tax returns for fiscal and with no material findings and have begun an audit by one of the state jurisdictions in which we do business for our fiscal filing 
we are currently not under audit for any other years or in any other jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated results of operations years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations total other income income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations gain on disposition income tax expense from gain on disposition income from discontinued operations net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april    and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue      change the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in sales to our largest domestic customer  verizon wireless  and our largest international customer  orascom  with only modest offsetting increases in other domestic and international business 
verizon accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal as compared to and of the revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
this decline in revenue appears to be largely due to verizon s shifting focus away from their traditional wireless network deployments  where our product has historically been deployed  to newer g networks 
our second largest customer in fiscal  intercall west  a domestic voip customer  accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal as compared to less than in fiscal our second largest customer in fiscal  orascom  accounted for in fiscal as compared to and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that the decline in orascom revenue in absolute dollars may be due to the recently announced plans of its parent company to divest itself of several of its middle eastern holdings  including some of the larger operations  to which we had been selling 
although our broadband voice processor flex bvp flex  which has become the primary system purchased by our domestic customers  continues to play a key role in our revenue mix  our quad voice processor qvp and pvp products and service contracts have grown as a percentage of revenue during fiscal due in large part to the declining sales to verizon 
the increase in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven  in part  by increased shipments to our domestic wireless customers  primarily verizon  as they continued to expand and update their networks 
however  the largest impact on our year over year revenue growth was the growth in our international revenues 
international revenues grew by approximately million  largely driven by new customers in the middle east and latin america regions 
in fiscal  and  sales of our broadband voice processor flex bvp flex accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
because the bvp flex provides increased flexibility and easier installation  it has been critical in helping us to acquire and retain our key domestic strategic customers  most prominently verizon 
in fiscal  we introduced our vqa product  which includes our new voice quality features and is primarily targeted at the international gsm market 
although we expected to realize sales of vqa products throughout fiscal based on the number of customer trials in which we were engaged  we did not realize significant growth in revenue from this product until very late in fiscal and throughout fiscal and during fiscal and  sales of our vqa product accounted for approximately and of our worldwide revenue  respectively 
while the revenue has been slow to materialize  we continue to believe that vqa presents material revenue opportunities  and we will therefore continue to make strategic investments in our international infrastructure and in customer trials 
following the success of our bvp flex  revenue over the three fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales  which represented  and of our fiscal  and revenue  respectively 
as noted in the preceding paragraph  our international growth has primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
although fiscal represents our most successful year of selling to international markets  we expect that in the coming year the international portion of our business will continue to grow as a percentage of overall sales as we realize more sales of our vqa applications 
however  we expect that our domestic customers will continue to represent the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
revenue levels for fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers and the market acceptance of our packet voice processor 
see item a risk factors for discussions of risks related to customer concentration and other factors  which could impact the timing and level of revenue 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in the prior paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold and gross margin years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold     change gross profit gross margin pts pts cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal was primarily driven by the decrease in business volume during fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the decline in cost of goods sold was not directly proportional with the decline in revenue due largely to the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs and the write down of potentially excess materials 
our analysis of gross margins below discusses the factors impacting cost of goods sold in more detail 
as noted above  gross margins were adversely impacted by our fixed manufacturing costs representing a larger percentage of our lower revenue base 
in fiscal  these costs represented of revenue as compared to in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a write down of potentially excess inventory items totaling million of revenue 
these factors more than offset the positive impacts on gross margin realized from an improved customer and product mix in fiscal  including an increase in the percentage of revenue recognized from maintenance and extended warranty contracts due to the decline product shipments in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was largely due to the increase in business volume 
however  cost of goods sold did not increase in direct proportion with the increase in revenue due to the inclusion of million of costs associated with stock compensation charges pursuant to sfas r in fiscal  and the customer product mix which was more heavily weighted to lower margin international customers and products  as well as the other factors discussed in the discussion of gross margin below 
as discussed above  the primary reasons for the percentage point decline in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal were the inclusion of approximately million of stock compensation  due to adoption of sfas r in fiscal  and the customer product mix  which was heavily impacted by an increased percentage of our revenues being derived from lower margin international markets 
partially offsetting the negative impacts of the international revenue mix was an increase  albeit still a relatively minor percentage of our overall revenue  in higher margin maintenance revenue 
also impacting gross margin unfavorably was an increase in the level of installation service spending to support both our international and domestic customer growth 
partially offsetting these net negative factors on gross margin was the cessation of amortization of the technology asset established upon the sale of our core echo cancellation technology in fiscal this resulted in a gross profit improvement of approximately million in fiscal fiscal gross margin also benefited from the sale of approximately million of previously written down inventory and the reversal of approximately million of warranty reserves due to the favorable resolution of a potential recall of a defective component in one of our older products with a past customer 
we expect gross margins in the fiscal to be in the range of based on forecasted product and customer mix and the impact of continued compensation charges due to recording stock compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 
over the next several quarters  if we are successful in international deployment  we expect to experience continued pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products through value added resellers and distributors 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense     of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
salaries and related expense decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline was largely due to a reduction in force at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and reduced variable compensation levels due to lower than planned sales levels 
we also saw a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million due to the older options becoming fully vested in fiscal and lower levels of stock compensation being incurred on newer option grants due to the decline in the price of our stock over much of the last two fiscal years 
the other factors that impacted the decline in sales and marketing expense included tighter spending control on travel and marketing programs which resulted in an aggregate reduction of million in fiscal and reduced agent fees of million due to reduced international sales in fiscal salary and related expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental hiring of domestic personnel and marketing personnel to support introduction of our voip product offerings  and pre and post sales engineers to support a greater level of installation activity and our voip products 
fiscal salary and related costs included stock based compensation associated with adoption of sfas r  which contributed an additional million of the increase in spending in fiscal the other key increases were attributable to a million increase in agent fees associated with international sales growth  a million increase in travel costs related to increased customer contacts related to international expansion and expansion of our pvp trials  and a million increase in amortization of field demonstration and evaluation systems associated with the protracted nature of customer evaluations of our vqa and voip products 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will continue to decline from fiscal levels due to realizing a full year worth of cost reductions from the reduction in force in mid fiscal and from continued cost controls 
these savings will likely be partially offset by increased variable compensation based on new sales targets for fiscal research and development years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense    of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
the decline in spending in fiscal was largely driven by the million in savings realized in the latter half of the year after the reduction in force that we did at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the other factors impacting the decline in spending were million of reduced consulting  consumed materials and allocation of corporate overhead due to being more focused on fine tuning our recent product introductions rather than completely new product development  which did not require as extensive an expenditure level in fiscal in addition to these savings  there was a decline in stock based compensation expense of approximately million that was substantially offset by the cost incurred associated with the reduction in force in fiscal the increase in spending in fiscal was largely driven by salary and related costs which increased million due to increases in headcount in the engineering area and merit increases and million associated with stock compensation charges attributable to the adoption of sfas r in fiscal in addition to these increases  we experienced increases in outside service costs to supplement headcount demands and increased deprecation expense associated with increased lab equipment to support new product design and test and increased headcount levels totaling million 
the latter increases were substantially offset by a reduction in spending on consumable materials due to the later stage of development of our products in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect to see a further decline in our research and development spending in fiscal as we realize a full year s cost savings from the reduction in force 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense    of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the increase in spending in fiscal was largely due to the costs associated with retirement of our former ceo during fiscal and executive search costs associated with locating a new ceo  which aggregated million 
these increases in spending in fiscal were partially offset by a million decline in variable compensation due to poor company performance in fiscal the increase in fiscal expense was largely due to the adoption of sfas r  which resulted in million of stock compensation 
the increase was also impacted by other salary related costs  which increased due to increased headcount and annual merit increases totaling approximately million and a million increase in professional fees attributable to the various legal matters that we are currently addressing 
we expect a decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal due to realizing a full year s savings from the reduction in force completed in mid fiscal as well as other cost saving measures we expect to put in place in fiscal acquisition related compensation expense in fiscal  we recorded compensation expense related to the vesting of assumed stock options and the restricted stock grants made in connection with the june  acquisition of jasomi 
deferred stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of options assumed and restricted shares granted to jasomi employees and is amortized to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the corresponding vesting periods 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation charges included in operating expenses were as follows year ended april  in thousands sales and marketing research and development total in fiscal  we adopted sfas r  which replaced the above compensation charges associated with our acquisition of jasomi and also introduced compensation charges for all equity based employee programs 
compensation charges related to the jasomi acquisition are now embedded in the stock compensation charges reported in the sales and marketing and research and development lines  discussed below 
in fiscal  and  we recorded compensation expense related to the portion of convertible debentures issued to employee stockholders  in connection with the acquisition of jasomi 
we amortized the compensation expense to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the lives of the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures matured in june  and were settled in cash 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
convertible debenture amortization included in operating expenses was as follows years ended april  in thousands sales and marketing research and development total amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended april   and  we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the jasomi acquisition 
we are amortizing purchased intangible assets to operating expense over their estimated useful life which ranges from four to five years 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
years ended april  s in thousands amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue impairment of goodwill and other purchase intangibles since the first quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a decline in our stock price and therefore our market capitalization  due in large part to the recent decline in our operating results 
as a result of our stock price s continued depressed state and uncertainty as to when our stock price would return to levels sufficient to justify the recovery of our recorded goodwill  we undertook an interim impairment review in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the review  we determined that the entire goodwill balance of million  attributable to the jasomi acquisition  was impaired and therefore recorded an impairment loss in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the purchase intangibles related to the jasomi acquisition 
the impairment charge was due in large part to declining sales levels in the small customer portion of the session boarder controller market 
in process research and development year ended april  s in thousands in process research and development of revenue in fiscal  we incurred a charge for in process research and development in process r d acquired as part of our acquisition of jasomi 
the amount of the purchase price for jasomi allocated to in process r d was determined through established valuation techniques common in the high technology communications equipment industry 
in process r d is expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist 
in valuing in process r d  cash flows were based on estimates from our and jasomi s management and from various public  financial and industry sources 
we projected net revenue to grow through calendar and decline thereafter based on the rate of technology changes in the industry  product life cycles and various projects stages of development 
we estimated cost of goods sold and operating expenses  including research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue based on historical averages and forward looking projections 
we also included in the projections estimated costs to bring projects to technological feasibility and costs associated with activities undertaken to correct errors or keep products updated also referred to as maintenance research and development 
we based the tax expense on statutory federal and california tax rates 
we based the percentage of completion of in process projects on an averaging of expenses incurred to date compared to the total estimated development costs for each project  time incurred to date and remaining time to complete each project and milestone based percent complete estimates 
the in process projects pertained to general enhancements to peerpoint software  combining of nat and peering capability  increasing throughput capability  enhancing the interface and developing a denial of service module 
the average percentage complete for the in process projects was as of the date of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that these development efforts would be completed in nine months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
as of april   the remaining estimated cost to complete the project is approximately million  primarily due to other projects taking higher priority in fiscal resulting in most of the development related to the last element of the in process projects slipping beyond fiscal the cost of capital used to discount estimated cash flows reflects the estimated time to complete the projects and the level of risk involved 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in fiscal and was as follows years ended april  in thousands cost of sales sales and marketing   research and development   general and administrative   total   the overall decline in the level of stock compensation in fiscal was attributable to the timing of option grants that are subject to accounting under sfas r 
to the extent that compensation related to older option grants becomes fully recognized and is replaced with compensation attributable to new option grants with lower fair values  we experience a decline in overall stock compensation expense 
for fiscal  this decline in expense was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation due to a one time charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal due to the modification of stock options as part of the exiting chief executive officer s retirement package  which was recorded to general and administrative expense 
we expect stock compensation expense will begin to stabilize in the coming quarters as pre fiscal stock option grants  which have been accounted for using the accelerated multiple option approach  become fully amortized and stock compensation expense becomes solely attributable to post fiscal grants which are accounted for using the straight line single option approach 
however  stock compensation can be subject to unexpected changes due to the size and nature of option grants and the underlying price of our common stock within a given period 
reduction in force and other charge 
year ended april  in thousands cost of sales sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total  in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to a reduction in force in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the recent declines we have experienced in our revenue 
the reduction in force involved the closure of our canadian research and development facility and a reduction of approximately in our worldwide headcount 
the employment of all individuals impacted by the reduction in headcount was terminated and over of the severance packages had been paid as of april  the remaining balance relating to the outplacement services portion of the severance packages should be paid in the first half of fiscal in addition to the charge related to the reduction in force  we also incurred other one time benefit costs associated with the retirement package for our ceo in august  which totaled approximately million and was included in general and administrative expense  consistent with the recurring costs associated with the ceo 
total other income years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands total other income     of revenue pts pts total other income consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  offset by other than temporary impairment losses on investment securities and a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in total other income in fiscal was largely due to the decline in our short term investments due to the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock in the latter part of our second quarter of fiscal and recent declines in interest rates along with the recognition of a million impairment loss on investment securities 
the increase in total other income in fiscal compared to was primarily attributable to higher interest income  due to a significant improvement in the return on our invested cash and larger average invested balances in fiscal our fiscal interest income will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
income taxes  continuing operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands income taxes  continuing operations   of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted in an effective rate of 
this rate was largely impacted by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in fiscal of million and the non deductible impairment loss related to goodwill 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation expense  research and experimentation tax credits  state taxes  tax impact of foreign operations and changes in the state tax rate as it relates to certain deferred tax assets specifically for california purposes only 
the tax provision benefit for fiscal resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for the year was adversely affected by non deductible jasomi acquisition related charges  including our inability to deduct for tax purposes in process r d related to the acquisition of jasomi and convertible debenture amortization  and the correction of a million error in the balance of a deferred tax asset related to a california r d tax credit 
the error originated in the second quarter of fiscal at the time we released our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and was corrected in the fourth quarter of fiscal after conducting a thorough analytical review on materiality  which was brought to the attention of and discussed with the audit committee  management believes that these amounts are not material to previously reported financial statements 
those items were partially offset by the reversal of million of reserves on deferred tax assets primarily associated with a california r d tax credit position under audit by california s franchise tax board 
in april  we reached an agreement with the franchise tax board regarding our tax credit positions and consequently revised associated reserves 
until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we expect the effective tax rate to be at or close to in fiscal associated with minor levels of taxes for certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
income loss from discontinued operations years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands gain on disposition income tax expense from gain on disposition income from discontinued operations of revenue pts in june  we came to a mutual settlement and release with jdsu  related to our sale of a large portion of the assets of our optical communications business to jdsu in fiscal  whereby jdsu paid us million 
we had recorded receivables of million such that the net financial gain from the settlement was million 
as part of the settlement  jdsu additionally released us from our warranty obligation  which resulted in the release of million of our warranty liability 
in addition  in june  we completed the closure of our international optical operations and  as a result  reversed our remaining million of reserves related to the closure 
net of million of tax expense  the transactions resulted in a million gain from disposal of our discontinued operations 
in fiscal  we completed the wind up of our optical operations  resulting in no financial impact from discontinued operations in fiscal or see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  and million as of april  additionally  we had million of short term investments as of april  compared to million of short term investments as of april  and million as of april  at april   we also had million of auction rate securities which had been classified as long term investments  consistent with the maturities of the securities underlying the auction rate instruments  due to uncertainty as to when they may settle 
the decline in our cash and investment balances is in large part due to the million used to repurchase our common stock in the second quarter of fiscal  million of cash used by operations due to our operating losses during fiscal and the final million payment under jasomi purchase agreement 
as of april   all of our short term and long term investments were held in corporate note and asset backed auction rate securities 
the long term investments are tied to auction rate securities that failed to settle at auction during fiscal  for which there appears to be no near term market 
although these securities would normally be classified as short term  as they typically settle every days  they have been reclassified to long term pending them settling at auction 
we have continued to classify some of our auction rate securities as short term  as we believe we have the ability and intent to successfully sell these securities within twelve months 
as of june   we had successfully sold million of the auction rate securities held as of april   without incurring any losses  and continued to hold million of auction rate securities 
at the time of our initial investment and through the date of filing of this annual report  all of our auction rate securities remain aa and aaa rated 
should we be unsuccessful in migrating to more stable short term investments or should the issuers not refinance the auction rate securities  we could be faced with longer term liquidity issues  which could impact our ability to fund operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months and could impact our ability to execute on strategic acquisition opportunities 
we have a million line of credit facility with our bank  which expires in july there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit and we were in compliance with all the financial covenants as of april  since our initial public offering in june  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations since our initial public offering  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal net cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities  our cash flow from operations generally follows our trend in net income loss of million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively  although the fiscal loss was impacted by large non cash adjustments related to sfas r compensation  unrealized losses on investment securities  the impairment charges related to our goodwill and other intangible assets and the allowance against our deferred tax assets  which totaled million 
the use of cash by operations in fiscal was largely due to the decline in our business  while still maintaining an infrastructure to support our historical revenue levels 
the other operating factor that impacted the use of cash by operations was a million reduction in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
further impacting our cash flows from operations was a decline in deferred revenue of million due to our having received cash payments in fiscal for transactions for which we recognized revenue in the current period 
partially offsetting these operating uses of cash were cash inflows due to a million reduction in our outstanding accounts receivable balance due to collection of prior sales and the reduced level of current year sales 
the difference in cash flow from operations in fiscal and profitability is largely due to the growth in inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to lower than anticipated revenue levels in the quarter 
the improved cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to profitability was due to a combination of reducing accounts receivable due to improved collections and more linear sales patterns in fiscal and increasing deferred revenue due to several shipments near the end of the year which required deferral treatment  which resulted in million of operating cash flow 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding at april  was approximately days compared to days at april  we expect to see continued modest levels of negative cash flows from operations in the coming year based on expected continued softness in revenue resulting in operating losses 
however  we expect the level of negative cash flows from operations to decline from the levels realized in fiscal as we begin to realize the savings from our reduction in force and as we continue to work down our inventory levels 
net cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands net cash provided by used in investing activities  the change in cash flows from investing activities over the years is due to a few key events 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash primarily as a result of net maturities of million of short term investments  a large part of the proceeds of which was used to repurchase common stock 
this in flow of cash was partially offset by paying million to jasomi s former non employee investors for principal and interest under the second tranche of the convertible notes issued in the jasomi acquisition 
the payment of the notes held by employee shareholders is included in cash flow from operating activities 
additionally impacting cash flows from investing activities was the purchase of million of equipment  primarily to support our development of the packet voice processor 
in fiscal and  we used million and million of cash  respectively  related to the acquisition of jasomi see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and million and million for the purchase of equipment in those years  respectively 
we plan to continue to invest in capital assets related to new product features and to support our efforts to sell our voip products 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands net cash provided by used in financing activities  the cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of over million shares of our common stock 
the cost of the repurchase totaled million 
this use of cash was partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
we repurchased no common stock in fiscal or the limited cash flow from financing activities in fiscal and was due to the limited level of option activity during those years largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
on august   we filed a tender offer to repurchase up to  shares  or approximately million worth  of our common stock 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
the repurchased shares were immediately retired and the aggregate price of the retired shares was reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the purchase price of the shares was allocated between the components of stockholders equity in accordance with the guidance in accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility lease  and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
in september  we renegotiated our mountain view  california lease  which extended the lease term through july  and reduced the rent cost 
our contractual commitments as of april   by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases    purchase commitments   total    we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve to eighteen months from our existing cash and short term investments and our million operating line of credit with our bank 
the ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months will depend on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment and our ability to access funds invested in auction rate securities see risk factor in item a related to auction rate securities 
should we continue to experience significantly reduced levels of customer demand for our products compared to historical levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during the latter part of fiscal or be forced to further reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april  and  we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempted to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities which prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal management has been able to liquidate on  or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
those securities with maturities of greater than one year  including auction rate securities that failed to settle and which based on their nature do not appear likely to settle in the near term  are classified as long term investments 
short and long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities in asset backed securities and corporate notes 
our investment securities are maintained at two major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our investments  but we did recognize an impairment charge of million on certain of our auction rate securities that failed to settle and have recorded an additional million of unrealized losses on the remaining auction rate securities as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments with interest rates that  unless they fail to settle  are reset approximately every  or days 
the underlying securities have contractual maturities which are generally greater than ten years 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
typically  the carrying value of auction rate securities approximates fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
as of april   we held two auction rate securities totaling million of par value  which continue to be rated aa  but failed to settle at auctions since the second quarter of fiscal and eight additional auction rate securities with a par value of million which failed to settle since the fourth quarter of fiscal while we continue to earn interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  the fair value of certain of these auction rate securities no longer approximates par value 
accordingly  we have recorded these investments at a fair value of million 
due to the prolonged nature of the decline in the value of the two auction rate securities that have failed to settle since the second quarter of fiscal and no clear indication of when they might settle  we determined that the unrealized loss was no longer temporary 
therefore  we recognized million of impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal on these two auction rate securities 
we believe that the million decline in value that we have experienced in the remaining auction rate securities as of april   is a temporary event and has been accounted for as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we have concluded that no other than temporary impairment losses occurred for the auction rate securities that began to fail to settle in fourth quarter of fiscal because we believe that the decline in fair value is due to general market conditions  these investments are of high credit quality  and we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in fair value occurs 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment and may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current transaction  which could change significantly based on market conditions 
our investment securities are not leveraged 
due to the short term nature of our investments  they are not subject to significant fluctuations in their fair value due to changes in interest rates 
as such  the recorded fair value of the investments at april   and approximates the fair value after assuming a hypothetical shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps over the remaining life of the investments  which shifts are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
bps equals 
the following table presents our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments subject to interest rate risk and their related weighted average interest rates as of april  and in thousands

to date  the vast majority of our sales have been denominated in us dollars 
as only a small amount of foreign invoices are paid in currencies other than the us dollar  we consider our foreign exchange risk to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
