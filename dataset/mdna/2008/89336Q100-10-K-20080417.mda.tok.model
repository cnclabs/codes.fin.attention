stock based compensation the company s adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  during fiscal required that it recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of operations 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires the company to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
the company calculates the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the company s actual historic stock prices over the expected life of the options  which represents the company s best estimate of expected volatility 
expected option life the company s estimate of an expected option life was calculated based on actual historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations 
risk free interest rate the company used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
the company reviewed historical forfeiture data and determined the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data 
the company will re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  the company will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
accounting for gift card liability the company sells gift cards that are redeemable only for merchandise and have no expiration date 
the company derecognizes card liability when either customers redeem cards  at which point the company records revenue  or when the company determines it does not have a legal obligation to remit unredeemed cards to the relevant jurisdictions and the likelihood of the cards being redeemed becomes remote  at which point the company records breakage as a credit to sg a expenses 
the company s accounting for gift cards is based on estimating the company s liability for future card redemptions at the end of a reporting period 
estimated liability is equal to two years of unredeemed cards  plus an amount for outstanding cards that may possibly be redeemed for the cumulative look back period  exclusive of the last two years 
the company s ability to reasonably and reliably estimate the liability is based on historical redemption experience with gift cards and similar types of arrangements and the existence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
the company s estimate is not susceptible to significant external factors and the circumstances around gift card sales and redemptions have not changed significantly over time
